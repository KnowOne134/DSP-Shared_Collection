    Go back.${prompt}
  7468: This's one of many isolated islands spurting from the Senroh Sea, kupo! It harbors such an overabundance of organic objects that it's acquired the appellation of “nature's treasure trove.”${prompt}
  7469: Conferred upon colonization collaborators by Adoulin's administrative authorities, these parcels provide services similar to those of the MHMU's Mog Houses, kupo.${prompt}
  7470: 'And of these ostensibly innumerable islands, each gets sliced into sections and managed by moogles, which gives rise to their name: “Mog Gardens”!${prompt}'
  7471: Should ennui envelop your entirety and you actually wish to vacate this veritable vacationland, shove off in the Mog Dinghy anchored near the shore. It sets sail to either Eastern or Western Adoulin, kupo.${prompt}
  7472: All the fodder you forage in this forest is yours to freely fritter away or store safely, kupo.${prompt}
  7473: |-
    But that means you'll be teleporting time and time again to take trinkets to your Mog House, you moan?
    Oh ho ho, that's simply not so, kupo!${prompt}
  7474: Your Mog Safe is miraculously manageable from here. Plus, you can draw doodads from your Delivery Box like a dream! Just inform me of your intentions or manipulate the main menu yourself to carouse at your convenience, kupo.${prompt}
  7475: It may be exposed to the elements, but this area is astonishingly analogous to your Mog House--both in function and the fact that it's free of charge!${prompt}
  7476: Plant seeds in garden furrows to cultivate crops conducive to your current lifestyle. Unlike gardening in your Mog House, however, they don't wither and waste away when you're not watching, kupo.${prompt}
  7477: The time it takes to reap your rewards differs depending on the specimen of seed you plant. If you're ever at a loss for how long gestation lasts, ask to “Inspect the garden,” and all your anxieties will abate.${prompt}
  7478: As your garden grows in rank, you can claim higher quality crops with the same seeds, kupo. The number of furrows will also fill out finely so you can sprout up to three seeds.${prompt}
  7479: Furnishing your furrows with fertilizer exerts an extra effect on your harvest. Beware, though, because the benefit breaks down after you reap returns, kupo.${prompt}
  7480: Finally, if a fine-furred follower fortuitously fiddles with your furrows, it'll benefit your bounty in a different way from flinging fertilizer on your fields!${prompt}
  7481: Where can you log, harvest, and mine...without needing to tinker with tools? The interior of this island, of course, kupo!${prompt}
  7482: The arboreal grove ladles out logs like with logging and gives out grasses as with harvesting.${prompt}
  7483: Then the mineral vein embedded in a bulky bit of bedrock offers ore for its owners, much in the same manner as mining, kupo.${prompt}
  7484: No need to trade in tools--the MHMU will supply special ones for you! Mine and harvest until you lose your lucidity and descend into delirium, kupo.${prompt}
  7485: The higher their ranks rise, the more places you can procure provisions from...thus powering up your productivity!${prompt}
  7486: Set certain fertilizers on roots or let loose liquids upon the boulder to see some delightful developments. Furthermore, assigning an able-bodied assistant to service these spaces grants greater gratuities to your garden, kupo.${prompt}
  7487: We've set two nets for you, which may each be brought up only once per day (Earth time), kupo.${prompt}
  7488: Sitting silently in the surf is the coastal fishing net, which seizes prey from the sea.${prompt}
  7489: Lounging in the lakelet is the pond dredger, which drags up freshwater fish.${prompt}
  7490: Both benefit from being baited with different bits, so watch which you use where, kupo.${prompt}
  7491: Mayhaps mentioning multiple measures of caution really is relevant, kupo...${prompt}
  7492: Can't carry any more commodities? Then burrow into your bag and sort out enough space to put them all in, kupo.${prompt}
  7493: Your yield gets yanked away by the evil aether if you leave it all and depart via dinghy. In addition, you can't collect any more curios if you don't have an open inventory, so don't forget to free up a fitting amount of room, kupo.${prompt}

  7602: ${prompt}
  7603: How incredibly intrepid of you to inquest into this island plot. Welcome to your well-deserved Mog Garden, kupo!${prompt}
  7604: Did you toil tirelessly trying to amass agrarian assets in your Mog House, or did your knees start knocking at the very mention of gathering goods? Either way, Mog Gardens have proven positively pleasant for all pioneers!${prompt}
  7605: 'As an emblem of our eternal esteem for each other--and to elicit enthusiasm for this endeavor--allow me to present you with ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}, kupo! Each day that elapses (in Earth time), you''re served a star!${prompt}'
  7606: The more refulgences residing in this rock, the richer the rewards you'll reap. But first, let's learn about the myriad methods by which you make use of your Mog Garden!${prompt}
  7607: No need to sweat sabers over your neophyte knowledge of Mog Gardens, kupo! Leave everything to mister moogle here and his go-getting green thumb.${prompt}
  7608: |-
    We begin with the bare basics.
    Let's get going on grasping that grandiose garden of yours.${prompt}
  7609: To be more precise, it may behoove you to barge into that basket over there, kupo.${prompt}
  7610: Back in your Mog House, I bet gardening was a chore. Here, however, it's a delightful diversion from the wild and woolly world outside.${prompt}
  7611: Simply stick your snout in that basket over there, and declare your discoveries to me.${prompt}
  7612: |-
    Congratulations on hauling in your headmost harvest!
    Don't forget, all that palatable produce and paraphernalia is yours for the picking, kupo.${prompt}
  7613: Kupopopo... I sense some seedlings of information sprouting.${prompt}
  7614: Unlike at Mog Houses, leaving the fruits of your labor to languish on the vine won't dry them out like Hildebert's sense of humor, kupo.${prompt}
  7615: |-
    Wha-wha-what?
    They wouldn't wither if we moogles watched over them properly, you proffer?${prompt}
  7616: Pish posh! We're on our best behavior when it comes to caring for crops, kupo!${prompt}
  7617: |-
    Owowow...
    I suppose the truth truly does hurt, kupo.${prompt}
  7618: So...the ferociously firm fruit that plunked me on my pom-pom fell from that flora?${prompt}
  7619: |-
    But how could it have come so far?
    Did wild winds whip in from the Senroh Sea just to dent my dome? How devilishly disconcerting, kupo!${prompt}
  7620: We have to corral these cranium-crippling conundrums before they bonk any more bystanders!${prompt}
  7621: |-
    ${name-player}, examine the rustic roots growing from that green grove to extirpate the extraneous and evildoing edibles!
    Trust me. It may seem irrelevant, but it'll actually help us get to the “root” of the problem. Kupopopo!${prompt}
  7622: Examine the earth-rupturing roots to reveal riveting rewards!${prompt}
  7623: |-
    Well, maybe not “riveting,” but rewards nonetheless, kupo.
    Either way, take some time to talk to me when you're done.${prompt}
  7624: Thank you for collecting those cursed comestibles. Feel free to keep any and all you find hereafter for your culinary consumption.${prompt}
  7625: 'As an aside, should you lack ligneous libations, logging will lay you up with some ${item-plural: 2[2]}, kupo.${prompt}'
  7626: Undulating umbrils! What in the world was that!?${prompt}
  7627: '...It seems this island has been infiltrated by an insidious instigator, kupo.${prompt}'
  7628: I'm sure that he's the one responsible for that headward-hurtling harvest mere moments ago!${prompt}
  7629: 'We must take up arms against this anonymous assailant before he can spread his tenebrous tendrils any further. Make haste and cleave that crag in twain to obtain ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt}'
  7630: While you're whittling away at that whetstone, I'll start in on a snare.${prompt}
  7631: A rotten reprobate's been running around like a rogue in the Mog Garden, kupo.${prompt}
  7632: 'To stop this sorry sod, we''ll need ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} from that bulky boulder beyond. Once you get it, make me aware and we''ll go from there.${prompt}'
  7633: |-
    Hip, hip, hooray, kupo!
    With this ${item-singular: 3[2]}, we can smother, smash, and smear that smug stowaway into oblivion!${prompt}
  7634: Now go out there and garrote him, ${name-player}! I'll stay back and serve as your sturdy supporting stanchion, kupo.${prompt}
  7635: I'd love to help with pummeling that pernicious punk, but we're preeminent pacifists. It's contrary to our character to lash out against living things. I wish you the best in battle, though, kupo!${prompt}
  7636: Do my ears deceive me, or is something stirring in yonder pond, kupo?${prompt}
  7637: |-
    Terrific timing!
    Let's launch into a new lesson by letting you lift the net sitting silently in the pond over there.${prompt}
  7638: Fish up all the freshwater fare you can, including that craven criminal, kupo!${prompt}
  7639: Nurse the netting out of the swelling spring to see if that evil entity got entangled in it.${prompt}
  7640: Should you find fishy fragments--or anything at all--apprise me as soon as you're able, kupo.${prompt}
  7641: Power to the pioneers, kupo! You've successfully seized the catch of the day!${prompt}
  7642: |-
    ...Or not?
    I never knew the numbers of fish were so negligible here.${prompt}
  7643: |-
    Kupopopo?
    Why, there's a gaping gash the size of Marjami Ravine in this net! It must be the work of that wicked wanderer!${prompt}
  7644: |-
    Kupah-per-pip...
    Uuugh, he's got me so flustered that I can't even string together a simple sentence, kupo!${prompt}
  7645: The scoundrel slunk off into the sea, for certain.${prompt}
  7646: There's another net specifically set up for obtaining all the ocean has to offer, kupo.${prompt}
  7647: |-
    Quick, before he cuts that, too!
    I'll find you after I finish fixing these frayed fish fetters. Just hurry!${prompt}
  7648: |-
    Unforgivable...
    That contemptible cur has riled up the unbridled wrath of myriad moogles all Mog Gardens over, kupoooooo!${prompt}
  7649: We sealed away any scintilla of seething rage that might swell to the surface of our souls long ago, but now is the time to shun our self-imposed shackles and make him pay with every fiber of our fur!${prompt}
  7650: |-
    It's detestable, deplorable, despicable even!
    No one pillages this paradise from perimeter to pole and gets away with it, kupo!${prompt}
  7651: What was that? Poles and perimeters aren't perfectly paired, and this profligate isn't pillaging per se, kupo?${prompt}
  7652: No matter, just nudge the netting that's sitting near the sandy shore and come calling when you've finished.${prompt}
  7653: Kupooooooooo...${prompt}
  7654: I've descried thy deceptions and shall dutifully deliver thy quietus, kupo!
  7655: It was you who sowed the sinister seeds of discord and danger in our delightful Mog Garden!${prompt}
  7656: How dare you threaten me with those pathetic pustules of pincers? For that, I shall show you no quarter, nor will I make the affair quiet, kupo!${prompt}
  7657: Succumb to the stony severity of maligned moogles everywhere!${prompt}
  7658: |-
    Release the beast, kupo!
    “Measureless Moogle Might”!
  7659: |-
    I...I...don't understand...
    Oh, altruistic and amiable Altana, bestow this biddable believer of yours with a glimpse of your good graces, kupo!${prompt}
  7660: Kupo...?
  7661: Take heed, commiserative crabs, for this is the fate that faces those who defy the allies of Altana! Oh, how ambrosial the aftertaste of victory is, kupo. This calls for a chorus!${prompt}
  7662: |-
    You saved your garden, you saved my garden
    From the tilled furrows, to the island coastline
    From the groves of forest, to the pond's spring waters
    This garden grows for you and me.♪${prompt}
  7663: When I heard the MHMU was making me moil in a Mog Garden, I took it as a demotion, kupo.${prompt}
  7664: Now, however, I realize that this little piece of paradise is precious and worth protecting.${prompt}
  7665: Worry not, warrior of the wilds, for I'll work extra hard so you'll not need to lift a limb, kupo.${prompt}
  7666: Here, I'll even give you this seed as a token of our ties together. Plant it and puff up in surprise at what pops up, kupo!${prompt}
  7667: Eleven energetic exclamations! The enemy has been eliminated, kupo! Peace prevails in our part of the province!${prompt}
  7668: Plant the precious seed I presented you and proclaim your progress to me when you're finished, kupo.${prompt}
  7669: I hope you enjoyed sowing your first seed. In honor of your accomplishment, I shall now show you the dance of my people, kupo.${prompt}
  7670: '...Hmmm.${prompt}'
  7671: Not getting knocked in the noggin with any nuts must mean those corrupt crabs scuttled back to the Senroh Sea.${prompt}
  7672: Speaking of the sea, it seems something just skimmed onto the shore from sources unknown. Why not go take a gander, kupo?${prompt}
  7673: Wonders from worlds beyond are wont to wash up on these shores.${prompt}
  7674: Could you be so kind as to creep up to the coast and catch a glimpse of what drifted down here? You never know, it might turn out to contribute to the colonization of the continent, kupo.${prompt}
  7675: 'Well, well, well, look what the whitewater whisked in, kupo. A bona fide ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  7676: I expected an entity of a more eccentric nature, but this one's pretty practical, kupo.${prompt}
  7677: Could it be that Altana's affections have been bestowed upon thee and thy dutiful deeds rightly rewarded, kupo?${prompt}
  7678: Now that you know the ins and outs of your Mog Garden, make the most of it by experimenting with everything as often as you can!${prompt}
  7679: Remember, you have finely tilled furrows, great groves of trees, and a placid pond to take advantage of as well. The more mature you are in tending to your territory, the more it'll mature with you, kupo!${prompt}
  7680: I'll always abide to assiduously assist you, so let's appreciate this agreeable agrarian acreage together, kupo!${prompt}
  7681: What an oddly ostentatious haul you have there. A sincerely scary specimen if I've ever seen one, kupo.${prompt}
  7682: Mew...${prompt}
  7683: |-
    Kupopopo!?
    It can talk, too!? Truly terrifying.
    I must mention this to the MHMU at once!${prompt}
  7684: Help...me...${prompt}
  7685: |-
    Jumping jagils!
    You heard the blubbering bubbler--back to the abyssal blue with it, kupo!${prompt}
  7686: |-
    Mew...
    Not...that...${prompt}
  7687: How do I help a floundering fish that doesn't want to return to its rightful residence, kupo!? My fur's fraying at my failure to fathom all this!${prompt}
  7688: |-
    Gimme! I want it rrright meow!
    My tummy won't stop rrrumbling until I eat something.${prompt}
  7689: Who might you be, mewling Mithra?${prompt}
  7690: |-
    Ah, it all adds up now, kupo.
    You wish to work, whelp?${prompt}
  7691: |-
    Waaait a minute!
    The MHMU hasn't hoisted any “Help Wanted” handbills for Mog Gardens!${prompt}
  7692: |-
    The sign said they needed someone to bake and sell brrread.
    Please, I just want to make some money. I don't even care if I get covered in meowder and crrrumbs, as long as I get paid!${prompt}
  7693: |-
    Does this look like a bakery brimming with boundless bowls of brown bread?
    I thought not, kupo!${prompt}
  7694: Mommy said it's dangerrrous for kids to go out alone meowadays, so I could only go as long as I didn't crrross Big Bridge.${prompt}
  7695: '...Forget crossing Big Bridge! You''re well on your way to crossing the Senroh Sea, kupo!${prompt}'
  7696: |-
    Meeew!
    You prrromise not to tell on me?${prompt}
  7697: |-
    All I want is to buy my mommy a prrresent!
    Please, just let me work...<sniff>${prompt}
  7698: Why would we want someone so young they can't read either signs or a map, kupo?${prompt}
  7699: Kupo...${prompt}
  7700: That is our word, kupo! You're positively prohibited from using it!${prompt}
  7701: Meow we're even...so I'd like you to gimme a job.${prompt}
  7702: First you mistakenly make your way here, and now you bother us with your base demands, kupo?${prompt}
  7703: Prrretty please with sugar on top? I'll work my tail off and do anything you say.${prompt}
  7704: |-
    This is not my decision to make.
    What say you, ${name-player}? Does this meek Mithra deserve a post on your prestigious parcel of land?${prompt}
  7705: |-
    What say you?

    Now, all I need is to search out the simplest service I can strengthen you in.${prompt}
  7708: Thank you so much! There's no way I'd disappoint you meow after you've shown me such kindness!${prompt}
  7709: Should you find this kit's conviction commendable, feel free to select her services again, kupo.${prompt}
  7710: You must provide payment, however. We'd never hear the end of it if you reneged on her remuneration. “Meow I'll never be able to get my mommy a prrresent! I hate you!” kupo.${prompt}
  7711: What kind of currency could this be, kupo? I've never peeked at such a peculiar piece in my life!${prompt}
  7712: That special eeeast jingly. They call “hush money.”${prompt}
  7713: |-
    Oh, Susuroon!
    Long time no see, kupo.${prompt}
  7714: |-
    Susuroon look looong and hard for you. Is time settle affairs.
    Yooo prepare!${prompt}
  7715: P-prepare for what, kupo? I know naught of any affairs in need of settling.${prompt}
  7716: No mince words! We fight nooow!${prompt}
  7717: Still sulking over your scantness of serendipity, kupo? Well, brace your bottle nose for another best-of-three gil tossing contest!${prompt}
  7718: Worlds of wonders welcome those who wait, kupo. You'll never be dexterous enough to dethrone someone as abstemious as me--not that I care.${prompt}
  7719: I have more meaty matters to which to attend, such as growing ${name-player}'s gathering of grasses into a grandiose garden of glee.${prompt}
  7720: Meeeaty matters...${prompt}
  7721: It waaait... It waaait...${prompt}
  7722: Susuroon help make garden graaand quick! Then contest goes on.${prompt}

  7727: |-
    Susuroon have striiict policy.
    No jingly, no work! Since forever!${prompt}
  7728: Then I'm afraid I can't help, kupo. Moogles are the most impoverished individuals both in and outside the Ulbukan continent.${prompt}
  7729: |-
    Yooo there.
    Susuroon service is notch top. No complaints ever.${prompt}
  7730: Susuroon do without jingly for one try, but do work to prooove good! No have contest and die. Yooo no want die, do?${prompt}
  7731: Knowing his fervent fondness for finances, his appeal emphasizes his earnestness to an extreme degree. Even so, this is your garden. Please point out the path down which we shall press.${prompt}

  7734: Well, that's the way the buckler breaks, kupo. I'd rather you hightail it for the hinterland instead of working here, but master makes the mandates...${prompt}
  7735: As convenient as this conditional contract is, we should probably give him some jingly--er, gil next time, kupo.${prompt}
  7736: He's a trustworthy toiler, so I doubt we'll need to take him to task too often, kupo. Rest assured, I'll make good use of his gusto.${prompt}
  7737: Ew, what a vile and virulent vermin you have there, kupo...${prompt}

  7744: Mee work mee snout off and get in return. Sound good?${prompt}
  7745: Why must my magnanimity always menace me so, kupo?${prompt}
  7746: |-
    A malicious Moblin made off without his Meeble after I did my duty and helped him.
    You do know how terribly Moblins treat Meebles, don't you? They send them on stupefyingly spooky sorties, then beat and beleaguer them when they blunder, kupo.${prompt}
  7747: Despite the Moblins' detestable demeanor, Meebles seem dim-witted or delusional enough to not despise their difficulties.${prompt}
  7748: Even though this energetic earth-eater has been emancipated, he still adheres to the antiquated attitudes instilled in him, kupo.${prompt}
  7749: 'As long as there''s a steady supply of ${item-plural: 2[2]} on hand, he''ll labor lovingly like none have looked on before.${prompt}'
  7750: I try to inculcate the idea of independence in him, but to no avail, kupo! Now that he's gotten a whiff of wizened worms in these whereabouts, he'll never learn how to live by his lonesome!${prompt}
  7751: Don't bee so down on yeeself, boss. All mee ask fer is sum moor work. A chance to get sum tasty, tasty grub.${prompt}

  7758: What a weird worldview to work with, kupo.${prompt}
  7759: It feels like my brain's banging back and forth in my belfry just thinking about how Meebles derive such endless ecstasy from exercise and exertion. We moogles skirt sweat and strain like a sickness, kupo.${prompt}
  7760: And when we do allow anxiety to alight on our auras, the only practical process of purging the problem is to withdraw water from the harvest until it withers...${prompt}
  7761: |-
    Kupopopo!
    That was just a jocular jab, a jape, a joke! Not even a reference to rancor in that remark!${prompt}

  7763: Compensation is the critical concept here, however. Without it, we're no better than those malevolent Moblins, kupo.${prompt}
  7764: How have you adjusted to governing these garden grounds, kupo?${prompt}
  7765: We moogles across the Adoulin archipelago all agree that carrying out your commands is a piece of copse candy, kupo!${prompt}
  7766: By the bye, did I neglect to notify you that an ancient associate of mine--Monsieur Kupont--shall arrive anon? I swear, I can see the foretold fun flowing from my fur already!${prompt}
  7767: You've been a caring commander to me, so how about I weave a wall's worth of worshiping words adorned by ardent acclaim when I introduce you, kupo?${prompt}
  7768: This is all predicated upon your prominent partnership in my plan, however. My floating friend fancies collecting the carcasses of crustaceans from all the places he patrons.${prompt}
  7769: Should a rare representative of deep-sea denizens reveal itself to you on the banks of the beach, please pick it up and place it in my paws, kupo.${prompt}
  7770: I simply can't wait for my friend to flap his furry physique over here. Oh, the terrific times we'll have together...${prompt}
  7771: I'd love to secure a striking specimen of a shell for him so he could have proof of his peregrinations, kupo.${prompt}
  7772: If you could wade through what washes up on shore and find a fitting figure of one, I would be...dare I say it...shell-shocked.${prompt}

  7774: |-
    I'm certain my sidekick will shudder at its shape and cry over its contours, kupo.
    There's one obstacle, though. This isn't a shell, but a breathing being.${prompt}
  7775: <Ahmph>${prompt}
  7776: <Munch> <munch> <munch>...${prompt}
  7777: |-
    Decadently delicious, kupo.
    The taste even triples with the turbulence of it trying to trek out of my tummy.${prompt}
  7778: |-
    <Grrrg> <grrrg>...
    The pain...it pierces the provenance of my puffy paunch, kupo.${prompt}
  7779: |-
    Now I know to never judge a shellfish by its sheen...
    That crustacean you captured may not have shown much intransigence in my innards initially, but now it's incapacitated me, kupo.${prompt}
  7780: On top of it all, an impromptu incident's mutilating my mind like a mauling from a mighty mace, kupooo...${prompt}
  7781: My amiable associate announced that he's coming with a companion of his own...${prompt}
  7782: That's all well and good, but his consort's the most terrifically terrifying tyrant of all time, kupo! Even the moogle's name is tyrannical--Kupivolo!${prompt}
  7783: |-
    Me, twitch and tremble like a twittering twitherym?
    For shame, kupo! I fear not for my fate at all!${prompt}
  7784: My only concern is for the good of this great garden. Ohhh...now a biting blizzard blows inside my bosom in anticipation of the apocalypse accompanying his arrival.${prompt}
  7785: In this condition, it's impossible for me to investigate the island for interesting items with which to placate his pernicious passions. Therefore, I entreat you to explore these environs and acquire an astonishing article, kupo!${prompt}
  7786: |-
    As for its form, however, I haven't even a hypothesis.
    I do have the utmost confidence in your capacity to come up with a compelling curio, though!${prompt}

  7788: Discover a desirable doohickey that'll trump the tyrannical tendencies of my companion's cohort.${prompt}
  7789: |-
    As for its form, however, I haven't even a hypothesis.
    I do have the utmost confidence in your capacity to come up with a compelling curio, though!${prompt}

    Why, this is...!
    I've finally found the fix for this firestorm!${prompt}
  7791: Hypnosis will heal my headache and stave off our slaughter, kupo.${prompt}
  7792: If we hypnotize him into thinking you and I are invincible, he'll surely shun his shenanigans. Then we can smack that smug smirk right off--${prompt}
  7793: By Altana's ancient affection, I could never consent to such cruel carnage, kupo! Moogles are a peaceful people who provide their powers for the forces of fairness only.${prompt}
  7794: Though hypnosis is indeed held in high esteem by humanity... A persuasive proposition if I've ever heard one.${prompt}
  7795: Well now, off to practice my new profession. If I can't cross coasts to learn hypnosis, then I'll commit to commencing a correspondence course, kupo!${prompt}
  7796: So, so sleepy...and it's all caused by that correspondence course in hypnotic hijinks, kupo.${prompt}
  7797: I tried out something that my tutorial tome termed “Hysterical Hypnosis for the Hoi Polloi,” but ended up sinking into slumber myself, kupo.${prompt}
  7798: Thus, I disclosed my displeasure at the cruddy curriculum in a bitter billet to my terrible teacher.${prompt}
  7799: Interestingly, I ascertained that the professor I persecuted was none other than my bosom buddy, the Great Kupellion. It's a small world, indeed, kupo.${prompt}
  7800: After that, we got to gabbing about the vile and villainous Kupivolo. Once I had espoused my extreme enmity regarding that hellion's horrific horseplay, Kupellion decided to drop by this Mog Garden, kupo.${prompt}
  7801: With the Great Kupellion here, he can mitigate the madness of the maelstrom that is Kupivolo by hypnotizing him.${prompt}
  7802: |-
    Then we'll be ready to raise the roof and revel in rambunctiousness!
    We'll be singing, “Who let the moogles out? (Kupo, kupo.)”${prompt}
  7803: 'What a grand ol'' gala it''ll be! And we''d like you to help${choice: 4}[ us prepare for the party/, seeing as you''re so perfectly proficient at courting capable companions], kupo.${prompt}'
  7804: 'To kick off this commemorative carnival, we''ll need you to pluck ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} from the pond and filch both ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} from the furrows, kupo.${prompt}'
  7805: 'I can''t wait for the wondrous and wild wassailing when we all meet, kupo! ${choice: 4}[Well, it''s time to tackle the technicalities./If only I could participate in the planning, too.]${prompt}'
  7806: 'To kick off this commemorative carnival, we''ll need you to pluck ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} from the pond and filch both ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} from the furrows, kupo.${prompt}'
  7807: Thirty thousand thanks be to thee, kupo! I could opine for hours on the opulence of your overt kindness, kupo.${prompt}
  7808: I've gathered a garrison of goods, myself. It'll all be worth it when we get to gaze upon the elated expressions of everyone involved, kupo.${prompt}
  7809: The troops are trekking towards Adoulin as I articulate this very assertion. They should disembark in a day or so, kupo.${prompt}
  7810: The troops are trekking towards Adoulin as I articulate this very assertion. They should disembark in a day or so, kupo.${prompt}
  7811: Entrust us with the excess exercises in expectancy. You've already laden yourself with loads more than the lion's share, kupo.${prompt}
  7812: Kupopopo, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7813: |-
    Now that we're all assembled, it was well worth the wait.
    Allow me to introduce this interesting cast of characters to you, kupo.${prompt}
  7814: First, we've flagged down Monsieur Kupont from frontiers far away.${prompt}
  7815: I was sincerely surprised by the stunning souvenir you slipped me, mon ami.${prompt}
  7816: Next is the crazy and cantankerous Kupivolo, who crawled out from the confines of San d'Oria's Bostaunieux Oubliette to be here with us today.${prompt}
  7817: |-
    Tsk, tsk, tsk. Where're ya manners, kupo?
    Call me Kupivolo Kupenreich the Calamitous, you crummy commoner.${prompt}
  7818: Then there's the Great Kupellion, master magician moogle from Gha Naboh Matriarchate.${prompt}
  7819: Everyone, this incredible individual is ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7820: ${choice-player-gender}[He/She]'s an avid adventurer, a pioneer primed with potential, and a Mog Garden ${choice-player-gender}[master/maven], kupo.${prompt}
  7821: ${choice-player-gender}[He/She]'s an avid adventurer, a Mog Garden ${choice-player-gender}[master/maven], and a social sensation who has fields full of friends, kupo.${prompt}
  7822: Hey, I've got a quirky question for ya, kupo.${prompt}
  7823: 'Why in the world are ${item-plural: 1[2]} and ${item-plural: 2[2]} washin'' ashore!?${prompt}'
  7824: How're ya able tah forage fish from that putrid-lookin' pond!? It's darker than the depths of the dank dungeon I deserted, kupo.${prompt}
  7825: Plus, where's the bevy of beautiful bedizenments to betoken my arrival?${prompt}
  7826: |-
    Oh, boy. Here we go again.
    Kupivolo's vomiting up viscous verbal vitriol again, kupo!${prompt}
  7827: |-
    Save us, Kupellion!
    Stop him from spewing such sour sentiments, kupo!${prompt}
  7828: |-
    Leave it all to me, kupo.
    I'd prognosticated that such a prickly predicament might pop up, so...${prompt}
  7829: |-
    Ta-da!
    Behold the Magian Moogle Mambo in all its miraculous glory!${prompt}
  7830: Kupivolo, you are getting veeeeeeery sleeeeeepy...${prompt}
  7831: A display this desperately deficient ain't doin' nuthin' tah me! Just you watch, kupo!${prompt}
  7832: '　${wait-animation: 1}'
  7833: |-
    Kupopopo!
    Mog Gardens mysteriously mollify me, kupo! Praise be to this epitome of excellence!${prompt}
  7834: C'est bien, Kupivolo. Wash your hands of your heinous humors and enjoy this exultant event, kupo.${prompt}
  7835: I didn't just wash my hands, I washed my whole body wading through whitecapped waters on my way here!${prompt}
  7836: |-
    How impeccably immaculate, kupo.
    Thanks to the heavy dose of hypnosis we dispensed to Kupivolo, this Mog Garden is now liberated from his lexical lashings.${prompt}
  7837: Lexical lashings be lost! Peril precipitates upon the very plane of this Mog Garden, kupo!${prompt}
  7838: Piping-hot paellas and steaming, succulent sirloins are sailing ashore. Now's the time to heat up some homemade handouts like your mother used to make, kupo!${prompt}
  7839: 'You can dredge up some darling ${item-plural: 1[2]} from the depths of the pond, too! Think of all the marvelous memories that''ll come meandering back, kupo!${prompt}'
  7840: Now is the time to search for celestial summits, not offer up ordinary objectives. Dare to dine with deities, kupo!${prompt}
  7841: What's frizzling his fur, mon frere?${prompt}
  7842: It seems that my hypnosis is so extremely effective that even the Green Thumb Moogle has fallen face-first into its clutches, kupo.${prompt}
  7843: 'C-could he have deigned to digest ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}!? I read somewhere that snacking on such sea life alters one''s actions and attitude in a manner inconsistent with what''s intended, kupo.${prompt}'
  7844: A cornucopia of curious concepts is flowing forth from my head like a flood! I must record these revelations in some sort of register.${prompt}
  7845: While I was once prisoner to a plethora of pedestrian perceptions, my mind is now moiling at full capacity. These will be the worthiest words of wisdom ever written, kupo!${prompt}
  7846: What a tantalizing tome, kupo! It ignites my interest, burns my beliefs, and captures my conscience. I...I...I...kupooooooooo!${prompt}
  7847: What a devilishly dangerous document he's derived, kupo. Just giving it a gander, my heart starts to heave and... Sacrebleu!${prompt}
  7848: After I wrap up this revolutionary romp through rational thought, I'll parcel out this piece of art to patrons all around Vana'diel, kupo! ${prompt}
  7849: We can't bear to have that book be browsed by a boundless amount of people, or the world will wax wacky, kupo. ${name-player}, please heed my heartfelt holler for help!${prompt}
  7850: |-
    You there!
    Please peruse the profound prose of my proudest piece and offer your opinion on it. Should your assessment be antagonistic, however, I'll need you to slink from my sight soon after, kupo.${prompt}
  7851: |-
    Peruse the prose?
    ${selection-lines}
    I will without a single scruple.
    I wager I won't.${prompt}
  7852: Such a blundering blockhead, kupo!
  7853: |-
    ...Ouch.
    Well, thanks to ${name-player}'s stupendous sacrifice, we were able to confiscate that compendium, kupo.${prompt}
  7854: |-
    Awake and arise, kupo!
    Moogley-noobily-joovily-goo☆♪!${prompt}
  7855: What happened, kupo?${prompt}
  7856: Did the hypnosis fail to fix Kupivolo's foul frame of mind? Did he damage this domain and drive away our dear guests?${prompt}
  7857: |-
    Did the hypnosis work?
    ${selection-lines}
    You bet.
    Well, you know...${prompt}
  7858: It did!? So, everyone enjoyed the event so excessively that they lost themselves and wandered away?${prompt}
  7859: |-
    What fraudulent friends, kupo.
    At least you were kind enough to come clomping back to me, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7860: I remember rather little from that rowdy reception, but I do know the Great Kupellion left this behind, kupo.${prompt}
  7861: |-
    I'm particularly partial to ${item-plural: 1[2]}, but I'll pass it on as a present for powering through professionally.
    Prior to parting, Kupellion mentioned that this was “compensation for conferring the compendium upon a compatriot,” kupo.${prompt}
  7862: I wonder what in the world he was warbling about. My worthless workbook on hypnosis, kupo?${prompt}
  7863: That must be it. Oh, how caring and conscientious a consort Kupellion is, kupo!${prompt}
  7864: Gadzooks! There's a googol of girls here, kupo!${prompt}
  7865: Moogle friend no mean you. Probably.${prompt}
  7866: G-girls?${prompt}
  7867: Boss know about new mount thingy?${prompt}
  7868: |-
    Do you know what mounts are?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course!
    Fill me in.${prompt}
  7869: Boss know chocobo, yes? Mount liiike chocobo, but with many creepy-crawlies instead!${prompt}
  7870: I knew boss smart ${choice-player-gender}[man/lady]!${prompt}
  7871: I don't think that qualifies as “smart,” kupo.${prompt}
  7872: Is very smart! Chacharoon only learn of it several shakes of nose ago.${prompt}
  7873: These mounts--young girls come to garden to learn to ride.${prompt}
  7874: Something with mounting, singing... Chacharoon no pay much attention.${prompt}
  7875: They say they are the “Glitter Girls.”${prompt}
  7876: And for some unspeakable reason, they want to wamble about with crabs!${prompt}
  7877: Girls want crab food to make good friends with crab.${prompt}
  7878: And they almost back again!${prompt}
  7879: Altana above! There they are!${prompt}
  7880: What's this? No curtain to pull back so we can make our graaand entrance?${prompt}
  7881: Oh, come off it. Where'd you expect them to hang a curtain out here?${prompt}
  7882: I don't know. Aren't there, like, trees or something?${prompt}
  7883: Would the two of you kindly stop bickering? That cutie over there must be the one running this place!${prompt}
  7884: A warm welcome to this humble Mog Garden, kupo!${prompt}
  7885: H-he's adorable...${prompt}
  7886: And fluffy like a floating little bunny!${prompt}
  7887: Why, if it isn't Chacharoon! You have our thanks for inviting us here.${prompt}
  7888: P-please! You take crab food seed and no hurt Chacharoon!${prompt}
  7889: Kupo! Ladies, pay perfect attention to this short and simple speech.${prompt}
  7890: Did we upset the little puffball?${prompt}
  7891: Cultivating and cherishing a plant is no laughing matter! You must respect and revere Mother Nature, kupo!${prompt}
  7892: It must be planted perfectly, watered wonderfully, and longingly loved!${prompt}
  7893: If you say so!${prompt}
  7894: Pay attention to the furball! After all, you'll be the one in charge of taking care of it!${prompt}
  7895: She's always been more of a kinesthetic learner. You know--do, not listen.${prompt}
  7896: She is, isn't she? Well then, let's go practice in that field over there. Whose is it, anyway?${prompt}
  7897: It belongs to ${name-player} over there, kupo.${prompt}
  7898: Well, what are you standing there for? Hop to it!${prompt}
  7899: Oh boy! Getting started and hopefully not giving up in the middle is my favorite thing in the whole world!${prompt}
  7900: Ugh. Fine, fine. ${name-player}, show them how it's done!${prompt}
  7901: 'But first, fetch some fertilizer! ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will do just fine.${prompt}'
  7902: Let's do this!${prompt}
  7903: Grow some crab chow and show those strange girls what a green thumb really means!${prompt}
  7904: 'Sow the ${item-singular: 2[2]} into the ground and apply the ${item-singular: 1[2]} to help it grow, kupo!${prompt}'
  7905: 'You got...${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}? What''s that, kupo?${prompt}'
  7906: Wooooooooow!${prompt}
  7907: That no for crab. That for sheep!${prompt}
  7908: So you mean...we'll be mounting our posteriors on sheep rather than crabs?${prompt}
  7909: We didn't come here to become wolves in sheep's clothing! It's crabs or bust!${prompt}
  7910: And how am I supposed to strike a chord on my...wait, what instrument do I play again?${prompt}
  7911: |-
    <Sigh>${wait-36: 1}
    You don't play an instrument.${prompt}
  7912: Oh, good! I've never been one to work with my hands.${prompt}
  7913: Those fickle friends are a fair bit flighty.${prompt}
  7914: Oooh, look over here!${prompt}
  7915: '${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 1[2]}!${prompt}'
  7916: I show strange girls how to make sheep chow!${prompt}
  7917: I'm not sure why that worked, but...congratulations on a spectacular show, kupo!${prompt}
  7918: The rest is up to them.${prompt}
  7919: Wow! I am so incredibly good at this! It's like I was made to be a farmer.${prompt}
  7920: '...All you did was shift some dirt around.${prompt}'
  7921: We've got quite a few seeds on us. Some that Chacharoon gave us, and some others that came from...somewhere. Here, take a couple.${prompt}
  7922: Ack! M-my hand! It's cramping up! I couldn't possibly stretch it out to accept your precious offering!${prompt}
  7923: Stop being such a drama queen. Take the seeds and plant them before I give you a good whack.${prompt}
  7924: I stayed up all night participating in Ballista. I couldn't possibly have the energy to--${prompt}
  7925: Ballista? Her?${prompt}
  7926: |-
    Eeep! Th-that is to say...${wait-36: 1}
    Wh-what I mean is...${wait-36: 1}
    Oh, just plant the seeds and water them, kupo!${prompt}
  7927: Absolutely astounding! Don't forget to come back every day to take care of your charge!${prompt}
  7928: I'd best take these into my possession.${prompt}
  7929: Hopefully they'll be pleased with their prize.${prompt}
  7930: Hmmm...where could those wistful ones be? It's been so long since they visited, kupo.${prompt}
  7931: One of them went on and on about junctioning and knowledge, kupo.${prompt}
  7932: Well, no matter. I've been wont to water the plant in their absence, and it's finally starting to bud.${prompt}
  7933: |-
    So, ${name-player}, while you're here...
    Would you mind bringing me ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}?${prompt}
  7934: That'll make it grow wonderfully, kupo!${prompt}
  7935: 'I require ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} so that the plants grow straight and strong, kupo!${prompt}'
  7936: If a way to a man's heart is through his stomach, then the way to a woman's is through flowers!${prompt}
  7937: 'Splendid! I was waiting for ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!${prompt}'
  7938: But our “Glitter Girls” are so swamped with school that they haven't had time to come back, kupo.${prompt}
  7939: '...At least I think they haven''t. One rambled on about getting some lessons from “Old Lady Lola”...${prompt}'
  7940: Be that as it may, I've taken it upon myself to water the poor plants, kupo.${prompt}
  7941: Boss! Mr. Moogle!
  7942: Glitter Girls back! They here very soon!${prompt}
  7943: 'Nice news, indeed! Time to work our magic with the ${item-singular: 1[2]}!${prompt}'
  7944: Sorry to keep you boys${choice-player-gender}[ /...and girl...]waiting.${prompt}
  7945: We had to give one of our most exquisite performances at the commencement ceremony.${prompt}
  7946: Thinking about how we're next on the chopping block makes me want to cry...${prompt}
  7947: The only one of us that's going to be on the chopping block is you, if you don't study harder!${prompt}
  7948: I wouldn't worry my head about her. She's the protagonist of her own little play.${prompt}
  7949: Yeah, performing for an audience of one.${prompt}
  7950: <Sigh> What I wouldn't give to be as clever as you, Izunana.${prompt}
  7951: Less wistfulness, more getting your hands dirty with this ghastly farming business!${prompt}
  7952: Me!? I'm not your personal slave!${prompt}
  7953: Your hemming and hawing is giving me a headache! Here. I've kept your plants in pristine condition.${prompt}
  7954: Thanks, Fluffball!${prompt}
  7955: It's so pretty!${prompt}
  7956: '...Or is it?${prompt}'
  7957: Gami Hiirahj, look at how yours spectacularly shines!${prompt}
  7958: And Sukasha Hiramdh...yours is certainly, uh...green, kupo.${prompt}
  7959: This is just grass! Are you sure you gave her the right seed?${prompt}
  7960: |-
    Tee hee...
    Tee hee hee!${prompt}
  7961: Oh, Sukasha, I haven't seen a thumb so black since Miyu got her hand stuck in that door!${prompt}
  7962: Speaking of calling things black, Miss Pot...${prompt}
  7963: Aha! This is all according to plan!${prompt}
  7964: That's got to be the worst “plan” I've ever heard of, kupo. In fact, the lot of you utterly failed.${prompt}
  7965: But...there should be one more. Where's mine?${prompt}
  7966: Yes. About that...${prompt}
  7967: Eeeeeeeeek!
  7968: M-my goodness! It's a mutant!${prompt}
  7969: So much for my plan.${prompt}
  7970: I must say--I was expecting something a little less...pungent.${prompt}
  7971: It made my head tilt too, kupo.${prompt}
  7972: Wh-what do you think you're doing!?${prompt}
  7973: If it bears fruit, then it must be plucked!${prompt}
  7974: Y-you call that “fruit”!?${prompt}
  7975: <Snort> Run!
  7976: Y-you'll pay for this!${prompt}
  7977: Byeeeeee!
  7978: Hm?${prompt}
  7979: Wait...it doesn't stink at all! Hey girls, get a load of this!${prompt}
  7980: A morbol whose breath doesn't cause bristling bronchitis? Is such a thing even possible!?${prompt}
  7981: I thought you were supposed to be an expert on plants, Puffball.${prompt}
  7982: It really does take all kinds...${prompt}
  7983: Isn't it great how sometimes all it takes is one simple breath to bring two people closer together?${prompt}
  7984: Why, yes. Now if only we had some mirrors, we could fog them up and use them on our grand stage as a smoke machine!!!${prompt}
  7985: Do you even hear yourself?${prompt}
  7986: But her idea isn't half bad. We could switch from singing to stage performance!${prompt}
  7987: Yes! The Glitter Girls, reborn!${prompt}
  7988: I'm getting too old for this, kupo...${prompt}
  7989: Pay them no heed, kupo! It'll only make you crotchety beyond your years.${prompt}
  7990: Morbol make me happy. Cute and smell like rose.${prompt}
  7991: 'This ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} for you.${prompt}'
  7992: How preposterously peculiar, kupo...${prompt}
  7993: |-
    Ohoho, if it isn't ${name-player}.
    Have you perchance looked over the laudatory lessons in literature that are the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} and ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}?${prompt}
  7994: As expected of an erudite exemplar such as yourself. I, on the other hand, had to harry and hound the MHMU higher-ups to hand them over to me.${prompt}
  7995: To my surprise, sundry Mog Garden secrets were sequestered within those sagaciously scripted pages, kupo!${prompt}
  7996: I was so intensely impressed that I will endeavor to embark on an excursion to meet the able academic who composed those compendiums...and ask him to assume the role of my assistant!${prompt}
  7997: |-
    Do you have a rousing response?
    ${selection-lines}
    Hold your halberd, kupo!
    Who penned those profound pages?
    No. Stay silent.${prompt}
  7998: Indubitably impossible, kupo. I am fated to find this father figure of farming named Kupogaard.${prompt}
  7999: Why, only Kupogaard, the most prolific of professors to publish prose on the hardships of husbandry. His beard is pretty prolific as well, being as magnificent as those on the most monastic and misanthropic of malefactors.${prompt}
  8000: Yes, the illustrious Kupogaard would make an apt addition to my entourage, kupo.${prompt}
  8001: Why, what happy happenstance hies the Great Kupellion hither to this humble hermitage?${prompt}
  8002: Greetings, guardians of the garden. I appear afore you to ask for assistance and deliver some didactic documents from the MHMU.${prompt}
  8003: Here you go, Green Thumb Moogle. These are the five flabbergastingly fantastic tomes you took the time to transcribe, kupo.${prompt}
  8004: 'B-but...these are crisp and clean copies of the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} and ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}...${prompt}'
  8005: What mindless madness could you mean by “you took the time to transcribe”? I've never authored a single article, let alone drafted in-depth dissertations, kupo.${prompt}
  8006: Whoops! What a massive misstep I've made, kupo.${prompt}
  8007: (It sincerely slipped my senses that he's relegated recollection of that event to the remote reaches of reason.)${prompt}
  8008: (He scrivened all five sensationally sapient yet scary scriptures while under the influence of my harrowing hypnosis, kupo.)${prompt}
  8009: (If having him recall that ridiculous rampage were to wake the whimsical and weird part of him, we'd be in deep doo-doo, kupo!)${prompt}
  8010: |-
    What I meant was...<ahem>
    I meant that ${name-player}...${prompt}
  8011: |-
    Ummm...
    ${name-player} meticulously monitored your meritorious mannerisms in this Mog Garden and made note of them for me. Yes, ${choice-player-gender}[he/she]'s your most devoted disciple, kupo!${prompt}
  8012: Oooh, how astute of my adventuring amigo! I think a thousand thought-out thanks are in order, kupo.${prompt}
  8013: |-
    Waaait...
    If you're telling the truth, then why's the author's name “Kupogaard”?${prompt}
  8014: W-well, it's a pen name. You know, a pseudonym to switch to so the scribe's secrets remain safe. We made this one from the names of those who were sadly sacrificed to that seriously spooky syndrome, kupo.${prompt}
  8015: The one that befell our benevolent bureau but days ago, kupo!?${prompt}
  8016: The swift and severe “wibbly wobbly woozies”!${prompt}
  8017: That's the most dour disease to decimate the MHMU to date, kupo!${prompt}
  8018: Indeed. Inundated by the intelligence they had to inscribe in those five profound primers, the scholars' jimmies turned to jelly, wibbling and wobbling about... They've still yet to stand upright, kupo.${prompt}
  8019: How categorically catastrophic, kupo!${prompt}
  8020: ${name-player}, how could you orchestrate such an outright odious onslaught of our guileless group, kupo!?${prompt}
  8021: Rebuke not ${name-player}. ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] is beyond reproach, kupo.${prompt}
  8022: If you wish to chastise and chide, choose the Mog Garden itself as your target for character assassination.${prompt}
  8023: '...At any rate, I didn''t brave that bilge-ridden boat just to bring you books, kupo.${prompt}'
  8024: I've come to coax you conservatory connoisseurs into cooperating with me.${prompt}
  8025: We propose the puissance present in Mog Gardens will purge the wibbly wobbly woozies from those blighted bookworms.${prompt}
  8026: Puissance present in Mog Gardens? Such as shining stars, kupo?${prompt}
  8027: Good guess, but I'm speaking of the life force latent in the land--the uncanny undulations unleashed by Ulbuka itself.${prompt}
  8028: Reprimand me if this isn't relevant, but haven't there been a lot of landshivers lately?${prompt}
  8029: |-
    For certain, kupo.

  8030: |-
    Do you know what's causing them?
    ${selection-lines}
    A problem with the World Tree.
    Not in the least.${prompt}
  8031: Hmmm... If I rightly recall, I came across an article about that ages ago, kupo.${prompt}
  8032: This territory truly traps in terrifying portions of power...${prompt}
  8033: I see. Still, there's no mistaking that this enigmatic expanse of earth embodies extraordinary energies, kupo.${prompt}
  8034: Maybe you can dig up some details on this discombobulating dilemma by continuing to colonize the continent.${prompt}
  8035: I've inhabited this islet for innumerable years, and I'd never known of such an incredible and innate influence, kupo.${prompt}
  8036: 'Although you may have ingested the insanity-inducing ${keyitem-singular: 4[2]}, I still say your spellbound spasm is attributed to the animus that abounds in this area.${prompt}'
  8037: E-either way, I want you to muster myriad mementos that contain copious amounts of the effervescent energies that grow in these gardens, kupo.${prompt}
  8038: If my theory is thoroughly thought-out through and through, then those are the only thingamajigs that'll whisk away the scholars' wibbly wobbly woozies, kupo.${prompt}
  8039: What exactly do you want us to wind up with, though?${prompt}
  8040: The rife resources remarked upon in the compilations you--<ahem> Kupogaard created, that's what.${prompt}
  8041: 'To be sufficiently specific, ${item-singular: 1[2]} filched from the fishing net, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} plucked from the pond, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} veiled within veins, kupo.${prompt}'
  8042: May the Goddess grin good-naturedly upon you and grant you glory, Green Thumb Moogle.${prompt}
  8043: You heard the head honcho, kupo.${prompt}
  8044: I have to craft conciliatory communiqués to all the casualties' kinsmen, so I can't contribute, kupo.${prompt}
  8045: If you're my most devoted and deferential disciple, you'll definitely do this duty in my stead. Riiight, kupo?${prompt}

  8048: If we don't get them, the wibbly wobbly woozies will continue to whittle away at our wisemen's wits, kupo!${prompt}
  8049: You're due a dab of deference, thanks to the effort you've exerted in easing this endemic, kupo.${prompt}
  8050: I also wrapped up writing to the reeling relatives of our suffering scholars!${prompt}
  8051: Finite phrases can't faithfully fill you in on how much we appreciate your altruistic aid, kupo.${prompt}
  8052: After amassing these burgeoning bounties brimming with blessings of the land, we can certainly cure the curious condition corrupting our curators of cognition.${prompt}
  8053: We're infinitely indebted to your industriousness, ${name-player}. Please accept this as a reward for your righteous rummaging, kupo.${prompt}
  8054: |-
    Shenanigans, kupo!
    I'd sooner snag that superlative straw sun-blocker than some boring books!${prompt}
  8055: You...really don't remember the ridiculous rampage that resulted from that reception, kupo?${prompt}
  8056: What rampage? I figure from my flashbacks it was all fun and flowers.${prompt}
  8057: Please take kind care of my comrade here--he'll need it, kupo.${prompt}

  8063: I'm...fantabulously flummoxed. How haven't I heard of such harrowing hearsay, kupo?${prompt}
  8064: Is unpossible not know such news of doom! Doooooom!${prompt}
  8065: |-
    Don't you think that heaping helping of histrionics is a hair hyperbolic, Susuroon?

    Heard of any bad beasties around?

    Yes, I have.
    No, not a one.${prompt}

  8070: A...peerless protector of patrons, kupo?${prompt}

    He here!

  8074: |-
    Meeting you is good.
    So, this is Mog Garden of ruuumor?${prompt}
  8075: |-
    Let Susuroon be introducing.
    This is Chacharoon. He come from famous ranch called “Famous Acres.”${prompt}

    He make quick work of beady eyes. Cut head right off. Riiight off!
    Okay, you give jingly now.${prompt}
  8078: (I don't want to jump to conclusions and condemn this cavalier for his countenance, but doesn't he look woefully weak and waifish?)${prompt}
  8079: '...Moogles'' hearts may be larger than life, but our pockets are pathetically petite, kupo.${prompt}'
  8080: Then Chacharoon need no jingly. Work for free. Freeeeee!${prompt}
  8081: Whaaaaaat!?${prompt}
  8082: If Chacharoon get eatsies and bedsies, then can learn the way of scarebeast. Perfect is plan. Peeerfect!${prompt}
  8083: We certainly have sufficient space for a scholar of the savage. I see no issue with consigning quarter to another curious Qiqirn, kupo.${prompt}
  8084: Piping plutons! You paddled protracted ponds while porting along a peewee partner, kupo!${prompt}
  8085: Yes, Chacharoon bring sheep buuuddy along for journey.${prompt}
  8086: Sheep is deeecoy to lure scarebeasts out of hiding.${prompt}
  8087: Ohhhhhh, such amazing idea! Of course it come from greatest guarder of bodies.${prompt}
  8088: He may be puny and puerile, but it looks like he loves his livelihood lots. Perhaps he can purge our property of those predatory pests after all, kupo.${prompt}
  8089: However, I'd hate for him to have to heartily hammer away without help. Hop to, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8090: No need to get big eyes, ${name-player}. It your duty to keep this garden saaafe.${prompt}
  8091: Let's give it our aaall.${prompt}
  8092: But caring for sheep not all snuggles and licks. Many buuurdens too.${prompt}
  8093: ${name-player} is chief, so ${name-player} decide if right thing to do. Chacharoon only follow ooorders.${prompt}
  8094: When time is right, call Chacharoon's name. Will sliiink from shadows and release sheep. Very quiet!${prompt}
  8095: Talk to sheep good. It like peeeople voice.${prompt}
  8096: Dooo what can. Sheep is limit! Wait, maybe limit is sky...${prompt}
  8097: |-
    ...Everything go in-ear and stay in-ear?
    Be geeentle and stuff happen! That all need know.${prompt}
  8098: Chief, tell moogle of Chacharoon's graaand feat! Much due for kind-words!${prompt}
  8099: |-
    Greetings, ${name-player}!
    You know, I thought sheltering that sheep would shroud this shire in shenanigans, but it's positively peaceful here!${prompt}
  8100: |-
    Could those really be...the frightening fiends of fable?
    ...Aha!${prompt}
  8101: I remember now, kupo!${prompt}
  8102: |-
    Care to cast a quip?
    ${selection-lines}
    They're those crazy crabs from before!
    I really don't recall, kupo.${prompt}
  8103: Is that the total and trustworthy truth, kupo?${prompt}
  8104: |-
    They're those nettlesome ne'er-do-wells who nagged us when this nursery was still nascent!
    Oh, how those crustaceans caused me caboodles of consternation, kupo.${prompt}
  8105: |-
    Well, they're those nettlesome ne'er-do-wells who nagged us when this nursery was still nascent.
    Oh, how those crustaceans caused me caboodles of consternation, kupo.${prompt}
  8106: So, they've been prowling the penumbras around the perimeter of this paradise all along, kupo...${prompt}
  8107: Scarebeasts show at laaast!${prompt}
  8108: Leave thing of every to Chacharoon! Once learn beastmaster triiick to turn meanies into nicies.${prompt}
  8109: Chaaaaaarm!
  8110: |-
    <Cough>
    Wow, what a devilishly daring display of deftness. How fitting for a first-rate fighter, kupo!${prompt}
  8111: '...Kupo?'
  8112: Wait...all that song and dance didn't make a damned difference. He's simply getting snipped to smithereens.${prompt}
  8113: Heeelp meee!
  8114: Well, I suppose this means I must make my mysterious moogle magic manifest once more, kupo.${prompt}
  8115: But if I unleash this ultimate upsurge of utility, it'll completely quash that cuddly Qiqirn! If only some stalwart soul were to stand up for that squirt and safeguard him as a shield...${prompt}
  8116: '...Aaabs!'
  8117: Kupopopo!?
  8118: Th-thanks for saaaving Chacharoon...${prompt}
  8119: That ardent academic could audition for an appearance in “Thirty-second Abs” any day. That's how long it took for those vile villains to vacate the venue, anyway.${prompt}
  8120: How dare you call these adorable creatures villains! They are merely specimens of the enigmatic and oft-forgotten “obscure crab.”${prompt}
  8121: |-
    Obscure...crab?
    Oh, is that why you ran in rallying the recruits with that ridiculous roar, kupo?${prompt}
  8122: I was certain their kind had gone extinct, but it seems they still inhabit this island chain. How fortunate!${prompt}
  8123: Who yooo?${prompt}
  8124: My name is Atelloune, but I am often known by my station as the assistant to the great zoologist, Professor Clavauert B Chanoix.${prompt}
  8125: In addition to the study of animals, though, I also dabble in botany, for I have an interest in all forms of life.${prompt}
  8126: Enough about me, however. I would like to point out that the obscure crab is named that partly due to the lack of information available on it. The last tome of reference to include even an illustration of this creature has yellowed with age.${prompt}
  8127: |-
    Thus, I am humanity's last hope to record pertinent data on this cryptic form of marine life.
    And with that, I must bid you adieu. Discovery waits for no one!${prompt}
  8128: |-
    Hold up!
    Smart lady cooomb forest for bitey, pinchy crabs?${prompt}
  8129: I am sorry, but I will have to ask you to refrain from asking the obvious. It is a waste of both my time and yours.${prompt}
  8130: |-
    Oh, a thousand pardons. I did not realize you were simply worried about my well-being.
    Fear not, for I am an expert at camouflage and only wish to observe them in their natural habitat.${prompt}
  8131: |-
    If so, then Chacharoon begs. Beeegs!
    Tell about crab weakness!${prompt}
  8132: Well, I planned on investigating every minute aspect of their behavioral patterns anyway, so I see no issue with sharing my findings.${prompt}
  8133: Even if you further your findings far enough to fathom their faults, do you think it's possible to sweep supremacy skyward from under their skittering, side-stepping legs, kupo?${prompt}
  8134: Chacharoon bit off more than can chew. Eye dribbles of sadness gush like waaaterfalls.${prompt}
  8135: |-
    B-but...no want give Susuroon eye dribbles.
    Aaah, much regretting how Chacharoon said he “beeestest in Famous Acres.”${prompt}
  8136: So that was all a falsehood to further your facade as first-class in fisticuffs?${prompt}
  8137: Not toootal lie! Chacharoon has more heart for bapping scarebeasts than anyone!${prompt}
  8138: |-
    I'll admit your ardor's ascended to admirably aberrant levels.
    ...Consider your secret safe, kupo.${prompt}
  8139: As first step, Chacharoon uuuse heart to make scaredy lamb better.${prompt}
  8140: And how do you plan on crafting this cowering creature into a colossus of courage?${prompt}
  8141: |-
    Feeeeeed it.
    Tasty meal is bestest medicine.${prompt}
  8142: 'Chief can get ${item-singular: 3[2]} for Chacharoon and feed to scaaaredy lamb?${prompt}'
  8143: |-
    ${name-player} so very much loving! Nicer than all people in wooorld put together!
    Chacharoon be gloating to moogle in soon-times.${prompt}
  8144: ${name-player}! A baleful blight has befallen this beautiful base, kupo!${prompt}
  8145: We were overrun by an onslaught of obscure crabs while I'd departed for a different domain, kupo!${prompt}
  8146: Sheep...die...to saaave meee!${prompt}
  8147: That zany zoologist zipped in and zestfully zonked one, which caused the cantankerous critters to clear out, kupo.${prompt}
  8148: Mayhaps mysterious moogle magic is no match for a maven made mad.${prompt}
  8149: I would ask that you put an end to that sniveling. All living things return to the earth one day, and there is nothing about it which we can do.${prompt}
  8150: <Snurk>${prompt}
  8151: |-
    Chin up, champ.
    I know, let's go and get him a gravestone! He'll be giddier than a gallivanting Galka, kupo.${prompt}
  8152: Still your tongue!${prompt}
  8153: Please do not fill this poor thing's head with childish fantasies. The more you interact with nature, the more you realize that death, though tragic, is a necessary part of the life cycle.${prompt}
  8154: I did not want to have to state things so bluntly, but you leave me no choice.${prompt}
  8155: |-
    You, stand up!
    Get it through your head that this sheep gave its life so you could strengthen your resolve!${prompt}
  8156: It left its bones and hide behind so that you could bolster your defenses by adorning them!${prompt}
  8157: It was considerate enough to leave behind tools for your disposal, so use them to buttress your physical and mental strength. Sitting here fretting would only waste all that it has done for you!${prompt}
  8158: What a scarily strict sermon...yet sound, kupo.${prompt}
  8159: Chacharoon agreeeeee. Chief of Famous Acres many time say close thing.${prompt}
  8160: “Putting life on line may mean crossing into afterliiife.”${prompt}
  8161: After muuuch time, Chacharoon finally make hide of it. And hair, too.${prompt}
  8162: I am glad I was able to instill some sense in you. On that note, I shall return to my observation of the crabs.${prompt}
  8163: Though they may be omnivores, they still would not have a reason to attack a lamb...${prompt}
  8164: Chacharoon, how do you reckon we react to the remains of your righteous ringer, kupo?${prompt}
  8165: Sheep want Chacharoon grow strooong, so we make stuff from he to power up!${prompt}
  8166: But ${name-player} is chief, so ${name-player} get diiibs of first.${prompt}
  8167: I guess the lesson here is “live life to its longest lengths and lift yourself to laudable levels of loftiness,” kupo.${prompt}
  8168: Ahhh, Chacharoon remember! One thing be lacking to craaaft what Chacharoon want.${prompt}
  8169: What doodad do you desire, kupo?${prompt}
  8170: 'Is ${item-singular: 1[2]}...${prompt}'
  8171: Procuring a possession of such paltry proportions'll be a piece of pastry for ${name-player}, kupo!${prompt}
  8172: Ooh, very boosting of spirit. Chacharoon put much faaaith in ${name-player}. We get muscle-strong and will-strong together!${prompt}
  8173: 'I''ll act as the agent for this arrangement. After acquiring the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, amble up, then ''and it over.${prompt}'
  8174: 'Please be paaassing ${item-singular: 1[2]} to moogle. Is Chacharoon''s dearerest wish.${prompt}'
  8175: Maaany thanks! Chacharoon very joyful!${prompt}
  8176: 'In return, Chacharoon tasty-make ${item-singular: 2[2]} from sheep.${prompt}'
  8177: 'In what way do you want to wield that ${item-singular: 1[2]}, Chacharoon?${prompt}'
  8178: Is to make tweety tool for beastmaster. More Chacharoon blooow, more stronger Chacharoon get.${prompt}
  8179: |-
    Such simple logic, but it certainly strikes me as sensible, kupo.
    ...Oh? I hear heralds of happy happenings hurrying hither.${prompt}
  8180: Mystery of scarebeasts be sooolved!${prompt}
  8181: I have ascertained the reason why the obscure crabs have been so aggressive, as well as what their weakness is.${prompt}
  8182: I attribute their aggression to the fact that it is their spawning season. They are simply looking for nutrient-rich food sources that will best increase their likelihood of procreating.${prompt}
  8183: Thus, all you need to do is place food they covet around the island so they will not think to encroach upon your Mog Garden.${prompt}
  8184: You there. I bet you can cook up something with exactly the type of nutriment they crave.${prompt}
  8185: I have already devised a specially tailored recipe, so you need only to whip it up and periodically set the resulting dishes around this area.${prompt}
  8186: Truuust Chacharoon! Make crabbiest food ever!${prompt}
  8187: As for their weakness, they do not seem to be fond of loud noises--or perhaps large vibrations would be a more appropriate term.${prompt}
  8188: Now that you note it, we moogles were privy to the perturbing powers of percolating plots for prolonged periods of time. Those crustaceans went clamoring for cover during the last landshiver, kupo.${prompt}
  8189: Now that you note it, we moogles were privy to the perturbing powers of percolating plots for prolonged periods of time. Those crustaceans went clamoring for cover when the World Tree went wacky and whatnot, kupo.${prompt}
  8190: If worst come to worster, just yell “Aaabs” with big lungs and they tit-tat away.${prompt}
  8191: Aaaaaaaaabs!${prompt}
  8192: |-
    Any old sound should do. You need not repeat that verbatim simply because I said it earlier.
    Either way, I will be returning to San d'Oria now that my research has concluded.${prompt}
  8193: |-
    What will you do, little one?
    I cannot imagine making bait will let you earn your keep here for the rest of your life.${prompt}
  8194: If Chief okay, Chacharoon live here looong time.${prompt}
  8195: I absolutely approve of this arrangement, as I'm already accustomed to eying his awkward appearance, kupo.${prompt}
  8196: Then I suppose he could easily be put in charge of animal rearing or some such task.${prompt}
  8197: Now that you seem to have grasped what the cycle of life entails...perhaps I should tarry here slightly longer and lend you some aid.${prompt}
  8198: |-
    And you. You are an adventurer, correct?
    As one who devotes ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] life to helping others, it would behoove you to see this through to the end.${prompt}
  8199: Sacrificing your needs for those of another creature should not only increase your physical bulk, but your ability to empathize as well.${prompt}
  8200: After all, life is based on sacrifice. Prey feeds the predator, the weak fall to the strong, and nations entrust rulers with their sovereignty.${prompt}
  8201: You can choose to turn your back on that fact, but it will only heighten your disappointment when it proves true in the end.${prompt}
  8202: Chacharoon want raaaaise scarebeast! But Chacharoon sacrifice for ${name-player}. Decider is ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8203: If ${name-player} knee-knocking about killing animal that look after much time, can seeend to Famous Acres. Much relief.${prompt}
  8204: |-
    Indeed. Should you determine that there is no reason to slaughter the creature in your charge, simply send it on its way.
    ...And on that note, I believe my work here is truly done.${prompt}
  8205: Susuroon must be excused, but have thing to say.${prompt}
  8206: In truuuth...Chacharoon be Susuroon's son!${prompt}
  8207: Wh-what a strikingly shocking statement, kupo!${prompt}
  8208: |-
    Had you heard of this heresy?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yup.
    Nope.${prompt}
  8209: To think that the nefarious nostrum of nepotism nagged even our noble niche, kupo!${prompt}
  8210: At least you have not been nicked by the nefarious nostrum of nepotism nagging our natal niche, kupo!${prompt}
  8211: Still, Susuroon's greatest happiness is to seeerve ${name-player}. ${name-player} do much for Susuroon.${prompt}
  8212: Yes, we give double eeeffort for Chief! No disappoint!${prompt}
  8213: Aboook! Abooooook!${prompt}
  8214: Aboook? Could you've caught a calamitous cold, my cuddly companion, kupo!?${prompt}
  8215: No! Chacharoon taaalking about book. You read me!${prompt}

  8217: Thaaank you! Chacharoon get much headpower!${prompt}
  8218: Susuroon's much happy for you watch son. Have much eyewater.${prompt}
  8219: Chacharoon don't read so good. But he like listen very much.${prompt}
  8220: Ever since he young boy, he beg Susuroon for bedtime stooory every night.${prompt}
  8221: His favorite stooory about crystal warrior who defeat Shadow Lord in faraway land.${prompt}
  8222: It have powerful bodyguard who pass through magical door to happy land and has much adventure.${prompt}
  8223: There, warrior rushed by savage tribe but beats 'em back, and defeats real strong Odin.${prompt}
  8224: Since long ago, there exist crystal. This story teeell of great warrior known across land.${prompt}
  8225: He defeated eviiil and greedy moogle, who steal all of jingly.${prompt}
  8226: Also give lesson to evil magic user.${prompt}
  8227: Even faced hopeless future, not lose hope.${prompt}
  8228: Man look to different world for new future.${prompt}
  8229: He travel through land, across forest to save people from lord of underworld.${prompt}
  8230: That is story heard just other day.${prompt}
  8231: All people happy with hope and dream real.${prompt}
  8232: 'Chacharoon grow up with ${choice: 2}[those/various] stories.${prompt}'
  8233: Chacharoon always say he be world's strongest warrior.${prompt}

  8235: So story true!${prompt}

  8237: Chacharoon, he have no interest in jingly, none at all.${prompt}
  8238: I can do business no without jingly. And me no do business, me no have more children!${prompt}

    Sure, why not.
    Not today.${prompt}
  8241: No help if not big glory!?${prompt}
  8242: Susuroon knew he count on you!${prompt}
  8243: Dare I deduce you are dealing with a decidedly difficult demand?${prompt}
  8244: Susuroon lost a coin tossing contest with his closest companions and didn't have a gil to his name.${prompt}
  8245: As a result, he took his big-bellied bride and beat a brisk retreat to a country in the east, kupo.${prompt}
  8246: With a past like that, it is not good to firmly fixate on financial figures such as jingly. I fear his future will be fraught with misfortune.${prompt}
  8247: Hm? So you're wondering what to do about the worrisome wish Susuroon would will you to do, kupo?${prompt}
  8248: That is truly a tricky task.${prompt}
  8249: 'You should go for it. Give one ${item-singular: 1[2]} to Chacharoon and say you need help harvesting such a hearty haul, kupo.${prompt}'

    Dear Chacharoon,
    I may have taught you all the basics of caring for feral monsters, but you are still a child. I do not expect you to remember everything, so I have jotted down the things I deem most important.${prompt}
  8667: Please do not take this the wrong way, but I do not yet think you are capable of raising multiple beasts at the same time. One should be plenty for now.${prompt}
  8668: If you decide to take care of another creature, you will have to part ways with the one for which you are currently caring.${prompt}
  8669: If you are to develop a bond with your animal, then it is best that you give it a name. Do not worry about thinking of the perfect name, because you can always change it later.${prompt}
  8670: Rearing beasts with an emphasis on “personal growth” will cause them to grow up little by little. When they finally do get big, they might just reward you with something for your efforts.${prompt}
  8671: Emphasizing “enjoying the moment” lets your creature live at its own pace and does wonders for its spirit. However, it will not get any bigger than it already is.${prompt}
  8672: Do not forget to bond physically with your creature. Each species has its own likes and dislikes, though, so try interacting with them in many different ways.${prompt}
  8673: I warn you against being too strict with them, however. If you do too many terrible things to them, they will succumb to darkness and turn on you.${prompt}
  8674: Moogle magic often works to calm them down, but on the off chance it doesn't, you will have to put them down with your own hand. See that it does not come to that.${prompt}
  8675: Ideally, you would continue rearing your beasts until they become adults, but this isn't an ideal world.${prompt}
  8676: If you ever have to part ways with one, please send it to me. I shall look after it to the best of my abilities.${prompt}
  8677: However, I will also leave you the option to put it down. Maybe putting you in that position will teach you the true value of life.${prompt}
  8678: You pore over at a congratulatory letter written in large, blocky letters. The message details further information about the recent expansion to your Mog Garden.${prompt}
  8679: Chacharoon, you've come quite a long way in just a short time. The seeds you've sown in your companion's Mog Garden are beginning to bear fruit. Well done!${prompt}
  8680: With the extra space you've pioneered, there is now room not just for one creature to raise, but a second as well. Work even harder, and the sky's the limit!${prompt}
  8681: No matter how many you see fit to take care of, however, I strongly recommend that you always keep a closer eye on one in particular, if for no other reason than to prevent your herd from stampeding or otherwise running amok.${prompt}
  8682: If you wish to bring your charges to the Mog Garden proper, then I must insist that you only let one accompany you while the remainder stays behind in the rearing grounds.${prompt}
