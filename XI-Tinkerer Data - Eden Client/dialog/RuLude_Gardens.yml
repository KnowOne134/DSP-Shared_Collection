  10006: I say this to you as a friend... Keep a safe distance from foreign dignitaries.${prompt}
  10007: I've told you before that diseases know no borders. Every patient needs a doctor; nationality and status matter not.${prompt}
  10008: Hmph. You haven't changed a bit, have you? You should take special care, my friend, lest you come to regret it.${prompt}

  10015: Ah, but it is a good thing you are here! Why don't you go to Delkfutt's Tower and report on the ambassador's progress? A fitting task for the newcomer!${prompt}
  10016: Hey, I know! You can go to Delkfutt's Tower and tell us how he's doing. Not too shabby for your first assignment, huh?${prompt}
  10017: Of course! Why don't you go to Delkfutt's Tower and see how he's doing? I know you just got here, but thanks!${prompt}
  10018: Tread lightly, as the place is crawling with fiends. It would behoove you to purchase arms in town, and to travel in the company of fellow adventurers.${prompt}
  10019: I hear that place is crawling with fiends! Be sure to gear up in town. And don't even think of going solo, either.${prompt}
  10020: We've heard that place houses fiends of foul stench! Stock up on new equipment in town, and make sure you've got a party to watch your back.${prompt}
  10021: Of course, you were promoted for a reason, so I have the utmost faith in your success. Best of luck to you!${prompt}

  10023: You've come this far, so I'm sure you'll do fine. Good luck!${prompt}
  10024: Delkfutt's Tower is on the island of Qufim. Avail yourself of the merchants in town, and assemble a party of fellow adventurers.${prompt}
  10025: Foul beasts lurk around every corner. Be on your guard.${prompt}
  10026: Delkfutt's Tower is on the island of Qufim. Scour the town for deals on gear, and remember that there's safety in numbers.${prompt}
  10027: That place is full of monsters, so watch your back${choice-player-gender}[, jack./.]${prompt}
  10028: Delkfutt's Tower is on the island of Qufim. Don't forget to shop for upgrades. And get some help to tag along... You'll need it!${prompt}
  10029: You'll surely run into some nasty company there, so be extra, extra careful.${prompt}
  10030: Welcome back. Her Excellency has returned and is waiting for you. Come, proceed into her office.${prompt}
  10031: Welcome back! The ambassador's returned, and can't wait to see you. Step on into his office.${prompt}
  10032: Welcome back! The ambassador has returned, and wants to see you. He's in his office.${prompt}
  10033: Ah, I'm so glad to see you.${prompt}
  10034: So, there you are.${prompt}
  10035: Oh, you're finally back.${prompt}
  10036: Thank you so much for braving the dangers and finding me. You have my thanks. Now, enough formalities...${prompt}
  10037: Thank you so much for braving the dangers and finding me. I'm very thankful. Now, let's get down to business...${prompt}
  10038: Thank you so much for braving the dangers and finding me. You have my thanks. Now, then...${prompt}
  10039: I hereby assign you, ${name-player}, to the post of attaché of the Embassy to Jeuno.${prompt}
  10040: I hereby assign you, ${name-player}, to the post of attaché of the Embassy to Jeuno.${prompt}
  10041: I hereby assign you, ${name-player}, to the post of attaché of the Embassy to Jeuno.${prompt}
  10042: May you apply all your powers for the sake of the motherland and her friendship with Jeuno.${prompt}
  10043: Do all you can for your country and her friendship with Jeuno.${prompt}
  10044: May you prove yourself useful to our homeland and her friendship with Jeuno.${prompt}
  10045: For the time being, devote your efforts to our righteous conquest of Jeuno's outlying regions.${prompt}
  10046: For now, the administration needs your help in the conquest and security of Jeuno's outlying regions.${prompt}
  10047: For now, we need your help in the conquest. We want to bring all of Jeuno's outlying regions under Windurst's umbrella.${prompt}
  10048: Prove yourself, and I might have need of you later. When the time comes, I hope you can help me as you did before.${prompt}
  10049: You know, there's a certain special task you may be interested in later. Now is not the time, but I'll keep you in mind.${prompt}
  10050: Do not stray far, as I may have need of you later. When that time comes, I hope you'll be just as helpful as you were before.${prompt}
  10051: For the time being, apply your efforts to our righteous conquest of the regions adjacent to Jeuno.${prompt}
  10052: For now, the administration needs your help in the conquest and security of the regions bordering Jeuno.${prompt}
  10053: For now, we need your help in the conquest. We want to bring all of Jeuno's outlying regions under Windurst's umbrella.${prompt}
  10054: Well met, ${name-player}. Her Excellency requires your service. Once you have completed your current mission, return and seek an audience with her.${prompt}
  10055: At ease, soldier. The ambassador wants a word with you. Once you're done with your current mission, report back on the double!${prompt}
  10056: Good day, ${name-player}. His Excellency needs your help. Do us a favor and come back once you've completed your current mission, okay?${prompt}
  10057: Her Excellency requires help in an important matter. Proceed, and listen well.${prompt}
  10058: The ambassador wants you for a special operation. Get to the briefing, pronto!${prompt}
  10059: His Excellency seeks your help in something important. Best head into the rear chamber.${prompt}
  10060: Thank you for coming, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10061: Thanks for volunteering, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10062: Thanks for coming, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10063: This embassy has received a request from the Archduke of Jeuno to send someone for a special mission.${prompt}
  10064: According to a message we received from the Court of Jeuno, they want someone for a special mission.${prompt}
  10065: We received a request from the Archduke of Jeuno to send someone for a special mission.${prompt}
  10066: Due to your exemplary service at Delkfutt's Tower, I believe you to be the foremost candidate.${prompt}
  10067: At Delkfutt's Tower, you demonstrated bravery above and beyond the call of duty. That's why I want you to spearhead this mission.${prompt}
  10068: Because of your selfless courage at Delkfutt's Tower, I want to recommend you for this mission.${prompt}
  10069: Will you serve?${prompt}
  10070: Well, what do you say?${prompt}
  10071: Do you accept?${prompt}
  10072: Succeed, and you will honor us all, ${name-player}. I am optimistic that you will gain the archduke's countenance.${prompt}
  10073: This kind of thing is a great honor, ${name-player}. I'm sure you'll gain the archduke's trust.${prompt}
  10074: Your deeds will shine upon us all, ${name-player}. I'm sure you'll be able to put the archduke's worries to rest.${prompt}
  10075: |-
    Proceed to the archduke's palace?
    ${selection-lines}
    Right away.
    Let me think about it.${prompt}
  10076: Your deeds will shine upon us all!${prompt}
  10077: That's the spirit!${prompt}
  10078: Spoken like a true Windurstian!${prompt}
  10079: Either way, you must present yourself to the archduke as a new member of the San d'Orian diplomatic mission. It is always darkest before dawn, as they say.${prompt}
  10080: Don't stress over it. All new diplomatic personnel have to report to the archduke anyway. It's always darkest before the dawn, as they say.${prompt}
  10081: Hey, don't worry! All new diplomatic staff have to present themselves to the archduke anyway. It's always darkest before the dawn, say the wise men.${prompt}
  10082: 'This is your ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  10083: 'You already have ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}? Well, I guess there is no need to issue a new one.${prompt}'
  10084: 'Here''s ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  10085: 'You already have ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}? Well, I guess we don''t have to issue you a new one, then.${prompt}'
  10086: 'Here is your ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  10087: 'You already have ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}? Well, I guess there is no need to issue you a new one.${prompt}'
  10088: Our friendship with the Jeunoans rests upon your shoulders. Luck be with you!${prompt}
  10089: Our reputation with Jeuno depends on you. Don't let us down.${prompt}
  10090: This mission is critical to our friendship with the Jeunoans. May the stars watch over you!${prompt}
  10091: Our prayers are with you. Now, make haste to the archduke's palace!${prompt}
  10092: We believe in you, ${name-player}. Now, seek audience with the archduke!${prompt}
  10093: Go, and the winds of fortune will follow you. You mustn't keep the archduke waiting!${prompt}
  10094: It reads, “Restricted Area.”${prompt}
  10095: You have no letter of introduction.${prompt}
  10096: The consulate is away.${prompt}
  10097: You do not have a permit to see the archduke.${prompt}
  10098: So, you're the new attaché.${prompt}
  10099: I am Kam'lanaut, Archduke of Jeuno. I'd like your nation's help with a certain matter.${prompt}
  10100: Oh, a visitor?${prompt}
  10101: Hello there. My name's Eald'narche. Pleased to meet ya.${prompt}
  10102: This is my brother. Don't let him bother you.${prompt}
  10103: Now, let us get down to business. I summoned you here for a certain mission. Have you heard word of the Shadow Lord?${prompt}
  10104: My sources tell me that beastmen in Davoi, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja are conspiring to return him to Vana'diel.${prompt}
  10105: They seek to do so by harnessing the power of mysterious stones called magicite.${prompt}
  10106: To stop their nefarious plan, I want you to go to those three places and seize that magicite.${prompt}
  10107: 'Of course, I intend to reward you for a task of this magnitude. I will issue ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} upon receipt of the three magicite.${prompt}'
  10108: With it, you can swiftly travel home, or to any civilized land, for that matter.${prompt}
  10109: So they're after magicite, are they? I wonder what this means... Take extra special care. The thought of a world under the control of the beastmen makes me shudder.${prompt}
  10110: I bet the beastmen have traps waiting. First, you've got to find out as much as you can.${prompt}
  10111: Eald'narche speaks the truth. Start by finding out what you can in town. I'm counting on you!${prompt}
  10112: A moment, please.${prompt}
  10113: By the order of His Grace, we have decided to seek the assistance of the Tenshodo, the organization run by that Aldo fellow.${prompt}
  10114: This secret dispatch outlines our wishes. Would you be so kind as to deliver it to him?${prompt}
  10115: He is a man of many talents. It would be wise to seek his acquaintance. Good luck!${prompt}
  10116: Excellent work. How fares the archduke?${prompt}
  10117: He wants you to gather the magicite? I know nothing about objects of lore, but perhaps you should try learning more about Davoi, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja.${prompt}
  10118: At ease, soldier. So, how was the archduke?${prompt}
  10119: He wants you to gather magicite? That kind of thing is far beyond my expertise, so you should scour the land for clues on Davoi, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja.${prompt}
  10120: So, you saw the archduke... Well, how did it go?${prompt}
  10121: He wants you to gather magicite? I can't offer any advice on those. Maybe you can try learning about Davoi, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja...${prompt}
  10122: Magicite! Yes, these stones emit the same power as crystals. Though impure, that power is great indeed.${prompt}
  10123: Now it is clear why the beastmen gathered where they did. They were drawn to the magicite's great power!${prompt}
  10124: Yes, it is time to eradicate the beastman threat once and for all.${prompt}
  10125: 'I thank you for your service. Here is ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}. With it, you may travel to any nation you please.${prompt}'
  10126: 'For now, I thank you for your service. Since you already have ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}, please accept this instead. May you spend it wisely.${prompt}'
  10127: The three stones are incomplete, but with the powers of the fourth stone that rests deep beneath Castle Zvahl...${prompt}
  10128: Perhaps then the Shadow Lord will rise again.${prompt}
  10129: Of course, the talisman that seals Zvahl's inner depths was put in place over twenty years ago. It would stop any attempt.${prompt}
  10130: I've also read that the three keys to open the seal were kept safely by the three great nations...${prompt}
  10131: Your Grace!${prompt}
  10132: What is it?${prompt}
  10133: Dire news, Your Grace! The leaders of all three nations have been attacked!${prompt}
  10134: Attacked... By beastmen?${prompt}
  10135: Yes, Your Grace.${prompt}
  10136: Confound them! They're one step ahead of us.${prompt}
  10137: So, they seek to resurrect the Shadow Lord... Quite a lofty goal for beastmen.${prompt}
  10138: So be it, then. Perhaps you should return to your embassy.${prompt}
  10139: I will call for your aid again soon. Until then, be well.${prompt}
  10140: Hey, what's going on? Oh, you don't have to tell me.${prompt}
  10141: Oh, so you went to Castle Oztroja and met a girl named Verena there.${prompt}
  10142: And she gets along with the beastmen. Wow, so maybe we could get along.${prompt}
  10143: Hey, Wolfgang! Wolfie, you here?${prompt}
  10144: What would you ask of me, Lord Eald'narche?${prompt}
  10145: Could you find someone named Verena and bring her here? I heard she's Aldo's little sister.${prompt}
  10146: Of course, my lord. But may I ask why? She seems of...questionable intentions.${prompt}
  10147: I think she has some nifty powers, so I just want to play with her. That's all.${prompt}
  10148: Oh, and don't tell this to Kam'lanaut. I want to surprise him.${prompt}
  10149: As you wish, my lord.${prompt}
  10150: Heh. I can't wait!${prompt}
  10151: ${name-player}! At long last you return! Congratulations on your success!${prompt}
  10152: I regret you have no time for reprieve. Our beloved San d'Oria is in danger!${prompt}
  10153: Her Excellency is away, so please take this to the court in her stead. Take the airship! I will remain and do what I can.${prompt}
  10154: Make haste to San d'Oria! You can board the airship now, can you not? I will remain here and find out what I can.${prompt}
  10155: Well, I am relieved there was no danger. Our embassy is safe as well. For now, obey the court's commands.${prompt}
  10156: ${name-player}! You made it back in one piece!${prompt}
  10157: No time for R&R, soldier! Your country needs you!${prompt}
  10158: The ambassador's away, so you'll have to carry this back to the administration. Take the airship! I'll stay here to get to the bottom of this.${prompt}
  10159: Get on that airship to Bastok, soldier! I'll stay here and find out what I can.${prompt}
  10160: So, it's business as usual in Bastok, huh? Well, we have nothing special for you here, so try following the administration's directives.${prompt}
  10161: There you are! Great work, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  10162: I'm sorry, but you've got no time to rest! Our beloved Windurst is in grave danger!${prompt}
  10163: With the ambassador away, I want you to take this back to the motherland. Take the airship; it's faster. I'll find out what I can here.${prompt}
  10164: Hurry-scurry! Take the airship back to Windurst! I'll find out what I can here.${prompt}
  10165: As long as the Star Sibyl is safe, then all is well. We don't have any tasks for you here, so continue your service to your country.${prompt}
  10166: 'You don''t have ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  10167: Nobody sees the sovereign without an appointment!${prompt}
  10168: Stand down!${prompt}
  10169: 'Just a moment. I need to see your ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}...${prompt}'
  10170: Thank you. If the sovereign requests your audience, access to the chamber will be granted by the guards inside.${prompt}
  10171: 'I''m sorry, but you will need ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} to get in.${prompt}'
  10172: This the hall of the Ducal Guards. Only the finest warriors may join. Come to think of it, this is no place for civilians like you.${prompt}
  10173: Sir Wolfgang is our leader. He was selected not just for his skill at arms, but also for his unwavering determination.${prompt}
  10174: Who are you and what's your business!? Oh, you're an attaché... My apologies! I have to check everyone who passes through here.${prompt}
  10175: In this job, I assume everyone's guilty until proven innocent. I meant no offense.${prompt}
  10176: Welcome. This is the home of the archduke, so please conduct yourself accordingly.${prompt}
  10177: Lords Kam'lanaut and Eald'narche rarely make public appearances.${prompt}
  10178: And you need a special permit just to have an audience with them.${prompt}
  10179: Both have kept their youth through all these years. Perhaps some otherworldly power watches over them. Great prophets like them are few indeed!${prompt}
  10180: Say... You know Aldo, the guy who runs the organization called the Tenshodo?${prompt}
  10181: |-
    Do you know him?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  10182: The Tenshodo was founded by Aldo's father. They've done so well in trading abroad that they own the black market in these parts. Er, so I've heard...${prompt}
  10183: Aldo took over after his father died. I've heard all kinds of things about him, but they say he's a smart and honorable man.${prompt}
  10184: Oh, you're a Tenshodo member? I guess you know more than I do, then.${prompt}
  10185: You should do business with the Tenshodo, too. They supply us with hard-to-find goods now and then.${prompt}
  10186: Beyond us stands the peace monument, constructed after the war. The embassies were built around it.${prompt}
  10187: Lords Kam'lanaut and Eald'narche designed these gardens of Ru'Lude. One look is enough to see how much they treasure peace.${prompt}
  10188: These grounds are the domain of Lords Kam'lanaut and Eald'narche. Please conduct yourself properly.${prompt}
  10189: Have you ever met Lord Eald'narche? He's still a lad, but the archduke's brother is gifted with incredible talents.${prompt}
  10190: Jeuno is safe as long as it has Archduke Kam'lanaut and Lord Eald'narche.${prompt}
  10191: The three great nations preach friendship, but beneath the facade is a struggle for supremacy. Nobody can tell what will come of it.${prompt}
  10192: That is why we must focus on our duties. There is no guarantee that the reign of peace we enjoy now will last.${prompt}
  10193: Did you know that Lord Eald'narche wears an eye patch? He had an accident when he was little, but it hasn't fazed him! Bless his heart.${prompt}
  10194: In the chaos of war, the archduke had a brilliant plan. He believed that the three nations' only chance was to cast aside their squabbles and stand as one.${prompt}
  10195: Each nation had to shoulder an equal burden in the struggle against the beastmen. His strategy was truly brilliant!${prompt}
  10196: Without his guidance, this world would have turned to shadow under the domination of the beastmen.${prompt}
  10197: In the past, there was a terrible war. My father once told me how the earth, swept by furious winds, was soaked in the blood of the fallen.${prompt}
  10198: I heard his tales every time he drowned his sorrows in drink. Now his stories are etched in my mind.${prompt}
  10199: Sir Wolfgang's father was a famous soldier, too. He commanded Jeuno's forces in the Crystal War, and his exploits are legendary.${prompt}
  10200: After the war, he looked after the families of his fallen comrades. What a great man... There's more to being a soldier than just brute strength!${prompt}
  10201: Sometimes I see the darndest things here. One time, a rookie of ours got cursed in the necropolis of Eldieme, and I didn't know what to do.${prompt}
  10202: I bet things are brewing that are way too crazy for us to imagine.${prompt}
  10203: Once I took a new guy to the Eldieme Necropolis, and he got cursed there. He went berserk, and had this unstoppable craving for raw meat.${prompt}
  10204: Well, I gave it some thought... And you know those torches in the rooms made of stone? Well, I heard that spirits hate them...${prompt}
  10205: |-
    So, I figured it might help if I lit a lantern with those flames and brought it here.
    That's how we saved the guy.${prompt}
  10206: But, uh... I've also heard that some spirits actually like that kind of fire. So, it might not always be such a good idea.${prompt}
  10207: I guess we were lucky then. We had no idea what else to do, and just wanted to do what we could.${prompt}
  10208: If you want, we can lend you the lantern we used back then. What do you say?${prompt}
  10209: |-
    Do you want to borrow the lantern?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, please.
    Not now.${prompt}
  10210: Try and bring back the flames in this lantern. We don't know what else could help.${prompt}
  10211: I seem to remember there were four torches, and that you had to light them in the proper order.${prompt}
  10212: Yeah, that's right. I remember screwing that up. Too bad I forgot the real order, though. Well, I'm sure you can figure it out.${prompt}
  10213: Don't forget it's the stone-wrought room that you're after. The torches in the caverns are for something else, so don't mix them up.${prompt}
  10214: Oh, yeah? Well, you're free to use it any time.${prompt}
  10215: If you knew exactly which spirit is doing the possessing, then you can figure out how to exorcise it. But that's the last resort, you know?${prompt}
  10216: Oh, the flame thing didn't work, huh? Well, I'm just glad the spirit's gone!${prompt}
  10217: Yep, I knew it. You learn something every day. I'm gonna write this up in the Guardsman's Daily.${prompt}
  10218: I always wondered how someone of his height lit that lantern.${prompt}
  10219: The archduke hosts so many dignitaries, every night is a banquet. Composing original menus makes me fret!${prompt}
  10220: This is the archduke's chamber. Only here can he find refuge from his busy schedule...${prompt}
  10221: But he's always out, doing his best for the Duchy. We all look up to him so much. His deeds benefit not only Jeuno, but the entire world as well.${prompt}
  10222: All I can do in return is change his sheets and prepare hot soup.${prompt}
  10223: These works are part of Lord Eald'narche's collection. His Lordship is versed in history as well as art.${prompt}
  10224: The archduke and his brother often relax in this room. We always wait outside, but they do seem to get along quite well.${prompt}
  10225: I do not pry into their conversations, but their knowledge of politics, culture, and philosophy rivals that of scholars.${prompt}
  10226: Our job is to confront anyone suspicious. Why, if anything happened to the archduke, the repercussions would be felt around the world.${prompt}
  10227: This monument was built at the end of the war...as a reminder that nobody should suffer like that ever again.${prompt}
  10228: And now, people forget the mistakes of the past and quarrel all over again. I bet this is the only place where that promise is still remembered.${prompt}
  10229: I want somebody to take this map I got in the north and stave off impending disaster, but you don't look ready for such a task.${prompt}
  10230: 'Maybe you can take this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} I got in the north, and stave off impending disaster... Do you think you''ve got what it takes?${prompt}'
  10231: |-
    What do you say?
    ${selection-lines}
    I can do it.
    Not now.${prompt}
  10232: 'I knew you were the one! Now bring me ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and show me what you''re made of!${prompt}'
  10233: Well, that's a bummer. I thought you just might be the one!${prompt}
  10234: 'Bring me ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}. I''m counting on you!${prompt}'
  10235: Good job! I knew you could do it. But be on your guard.${prompt}
  10236: Don't forget our vow here. Remember how precious peace is.${prompt}
  10237: Mmm? You've already got one. Well, that's great--think of it as a farewell present.${prompt}
  10238: Good luck with the petition!${prompt}
  10239: Well, if they can tear down the clock tower, who knows what they'll do to the monument? Quick, where do I sign?${prompt}
  10240: Oh, dear... Did you lose your way? I didn't call for a cub like you.${prompt}
  10241: Well, well, well... You might have what it takes. Hear me out. You've got nothing to lose.${prompt}
  10242: |-
    Hear me out, okay?
    ${selection-lines}
    All right.
    No, thanks.${prompt}
  10243: Oh, what a pity. Goodbye.${prompt}
  10244: All right, look. The archduke's running low on food and gifts for all the foreign bigwigs he entertains.${prompt}
  10245: Don't you think something weird's going on? I mean, ambassadors from the three nations stop by all the time, and the train of delegates and caravans never stops.${prompt}
  10246: The reward is really something. It's a key the archduke himself found in the ruins. They say it makes things...automatically. Well? Wanna try it?${prompt}
  10247: |-
    Wanna try it?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  10248: Guess I was wrong about you. Bye.${prompt}
  10249: Oh, now you're talkin'. First, pick out what you're going to collect from this list here.${prompt}
  10250: |-
    What to collect?
    ${selection-lines}
    Accessories.
    Fine Seafood.
    Rare Herbs & Vegetables.
    Luxury Weapons and Armor.
    Exquisite Dishes.
    Exotic Medicines.
    Magical Instruments.
    Expensive Jewels.
    Quit.${prompt}
  10251: 'Okay, so you''re going to have to collect ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}'
  10252: 'Your reward will be ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}. Wanna see the others?${prompt}'
  10253: |-
    Do you want to see the others?
    ${selection-lines}
    You bet.
    Not now.${prompt}
  10254: Okay. So, good luck! You can only have one chip for each element. They break when you use them, so come back if you want more.${prompt}
  10255: What, you don't want to do it? All right. Just pick from this list, then.${prompt}
  10256: Okey-dokey. Not too shabby. This is for you!${prompt}
  10257: I don't know the details, but you're supposed to take it to the ruins underground and put some mineral called ada-something in it. Well, come back anytime!${prompt}
  10258: Now offering quick and easy delivery of packages to homes everywhere!${prompt}
  10259: Would you care to see a map of Greater Jeuno?${prompt}
  10260: |-
    What do you say?
    ${selection-lines}
    Show me.

    Are there any fees?
    Are there any limits?
    How do you check up on merchandise?
    How do you remove an item?
    My “Sales Status” list is full!
    Nothing right now.${prompt}
  10293: Auction houses can be found in all of Vana'diel's major cities. Here adventurers gather to bid on battle spoils, unwanted items, old armor...almost anything.${prompt}
  10294: Currently, the auction houses in Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno all work independently. Therefore, prices differ from city to city.${prompt}
  10295: Adventurers may use any auction house regardless of nationality.${prompt}
  10296: The first adventurer to bid at or above the asking price will automatically purchase the product.${prompt}
  10297: Once put up for auction, merchandise will remain there for a maximum of thirty weeks Vana'diel time (nine-and-a-half days Earth time).${prompt}
  10298: If merchandise does not sell within this time limit, it will be returned to the seller's current residence.${prompt}
  10299: Transaction fees are proportional to the amount for which an item is put up on auction. The method of calculating this fee is different for single items and stackable items.${prompt}
  10300: A transaction fee is collected when any merchandise is put up for auction. This fee is nonrefundable.${prompt}
  10301: The International Auction House Committee, or IAHC, has declared that a maximum of seven items may be put up for auction at one time.${prompt}
  10302: However, the IAHC has recently removed the limit to how many items one may purchase.${prompt}
  10303: A small amount of time is required before new merchandise appears on our bid list.${prompt}
  10304: Once an item appears on your “Sales Status” list, it may not immediately appear on the bid list. If you do not see your item on the bid list, try looking again at a later time.${prompt}
  10305: If you would like to withdraw an item from an auction, you must travel to the auction house, and select “Stop Sale” from the “Sales Status” menu.${prompt}
  10306: To remove an item from your “Sales Status” list, you must visit an auction counter to acknowledge the sale or return of your merchandise.${prompt}
  10307: Otherwise, previously sold or returned items will fill up your list and prevent you from selling any more merchandise.${prompt}
  10308: At any auction counter, open the “Sales Status” menu and acknowledge the transaction to clear it from the list.${prompt}
  10309: Press the confirm button to remove any transaction colored yellow (sold) or red (returned).${prompt}
  10310: Is there anything else you would like to know?${prompt}

  10470: |-
    Now look at her... There isn't a soul in Vana'diel who doesn't know her beauty.
    Let me tell you a story...${prompt}
  10471: Long ago, there was a young man--captain of a fishing boat, he was--who lived a modest life in the peaceful harbors of Jeuno. It was often hard for him to make ends meet, but he and his fishing buddies had no complaints. They loved their tiny village...${prompt}
  10472: However, one stormy night, fate came knocking at his door when he rescued two strange lads from the nearby waters. From that day on, the wheels of change began to turn.${prompt}
  10473: There was something different--something special--about those two. They possessed a great deal of knowledge and leadership, and in just a short period of time, they transformed Jeuno from an insignificant dot on the map into a giant metropolis.${prompt}
  10474: At first, the captain welcomed these changes with open arms. However, later he began to ask himself if all this was truly for the good of Jeuno, or if the city was just being used as a piece of some bigger plan put into motion by the two mysterious men...${prompt}
  10475: But by then it was too late... Jeuno and the people living within her walls had changed... There was no turning back.${prompt}
  10476: 'And so the captain decided: While he still had life inside his bones, he would make it his mission to remain and watch over his hometown.${prompt}'
  10477: Good day, Maat.${prompt}
  10478: Oh, if it isn't Doctor Monberaux.${prompt}
  10479: You are looking quite healthy these days, old chap.${prompt}
  10480: As healthy as a Hobgoblin, thanks to your treatment. You sure know how to keep your patients happy, heh heh heh.${prompt}
  10481: Ha ha. I'm just doing my job.${prompt}
  10482: By the way...${prompt}
  10483: Hm?${prompt}
  10484: You mentioned this “captain” watching over Jeuno. What exactly was he making sure of?${prompt}
  10485: |-
    Hmmm...
    Well, he was probably just making sure that everybody was happy.${prompt}
  10486: You know, I think you are probably right.${prompt}
  10487: There are many things out there that threaten the happiness of all Jeunoans, and he couldn't stand to sit back and watch that happiness be snatched away from them.${prompt}
  10488: Maat...${prompt}
  10489: |-
    Ahem. Ah, will you look at the time.
    I must be getting back to the infirmary. Take care, my friend.${prompt}

    Don't you worry, doctor. I always do.
    Oh, and you keep working on Wolfgang. Once he sees what's really going on in this place, he'll start to change. I know it...${prompt}
  10491: As do I...${prompt}
  10492: Now, where was I...${prompt}
  10493: As much as I long to see it, it's likely I won't be around when the truth finally comes out. But young adventurers like you will. That's why I want you to be all that you can be.${prompt}
  10494: Do not forget the hardships you have endured to make it this far, and maybe one day you, too, will find something worth giving your life to protect.${prompt}
  10495: They say that where there is a beginning, there is an end. However, I believe that some things, like memories, don't have to end. That is where you young folk come in...${prompt}

  10535: If you promise to keep quiet on the subject, I'll tell you what I know.${prompt}
  10536: Twenty years ago, the Rolanberry Fields were rampaged by those dreadful Crawlers. The problem escalated to the point where the people of Jeuno had nothing to put on their dinner tables.${prompt}
  10537: One adventurer saw the problem that lay before Jeuno and began calling for volunteers to travel to the Crawlers' Nest and exterminate the queen.${prompt}
  10538: Seeing that her research was going nowhere, Rasusu decided to take her chances and go along with the adventurer.${prompt}
  10539: I tried to contact Koru-Moru, in hopes that I could get him to persuade Rasusu to stay in Jeuno. But at the same time, Windurst had its own problems, and I couldn't get ahold of him.${prompt}
  10540: And then she went...and no one ever saw her again.${prompt}
  10541: After the war ended, I tried writing Koru-Moru many times, but I could never bring myself to tell him the truth about his beloved Rasusu.${prompt}
  10542: Windurst had been devastated by the Great War, and Koru-Moru had seen the devastation with his own eyes. I could not bear to be the bringer of any more tragic news.${prompt}

  10545: Twenty years ago, Koru-Moru and Rasusu worked side by side for the good of Vana'diel.${prompt}

    Conquest points.
    The effects of controlling regions.
    Regions controlled by other nations.
    Regions under beastman control.${prompt}
  10565: All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt}
  10566: Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt}
  10567: Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt}
  10568: So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt}
  10569: |-
    Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.
    They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt}
  10570: Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt}
  10571: Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt}
  10572: |-
    So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.
    We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt}
  10573: |-
    You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.
    Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt}
  10574: |-
    Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.
    The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt}
  10575: |-
    You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  10576: |-
    We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  10577: |-
    You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.
    Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt}
  10578: Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt}
  10579: |-
    You also receive rank points for completing missions.
    Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt}
  10580: |-
    You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.
    Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}
  10581: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt}
  10582: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt}
  10583: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt}
  10584: Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt}
  10585: Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt}
  10586: Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt}
  10587: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt}
  10588: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt}
  10589: |-
    Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.
    If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt}
  10590: If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt}
  10591: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt}
  10592: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt}
  10593: There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt}
  10594: |-
    Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.

    Indeed. Without them, we would not have been able to dig that mine.

    Huh. Nothing.
    With all the Quadav guarding the place, you think we'd find a treasure or two!${prompt}

  10926: Ulrich, wait!${prompt}

  10988: |-
    Kahk! Silence...
    Our little friend came all the way from Windurst to greet us. Let us hear what he has to say.${prompt}
  10989: Kahk-ka-ka! You came all this way to ask about the Full Moon Fountain?${prompt}
  10990: Well, you Tartutaru have probably already realized why the Horutoto Ruins were built and why the Full Moon Fountain exists underneath them.${prompt}
  10991: Those ruins are evil.${prompt}
  10992: The towers sponge dry the areas around Sarutabaruta of all their magic.${prompt}
  10993: You think that we Yagudo are the cause of these wastelands, but you only have yourselves to thank. You--the Tarutaru that activated those towers!${prompt}
  10994: The towers are all damaged! How do you explain magic still being drained from the plains of Sarutabaruta?${prompt}
  10995: What about you Yagudo? What are those things that you continue digging? Those stones...maybe they are the cause of all this?${prompt}
  10996: Kahk-ka-ka...I commend you on your perceptiveness.${prompt}
  10997: But the reason Sarutabaruta is becoming a wasteland has nothing to do with those stones.${prompt}
  10998: That night, twenty years ago, when we were defeated by your armies, you made a grave mistake...${prompt}
  10999: Kahk! Kahk! You still do not understand?${prompt}
  11000: Make your way deep into the central tower of the Horutoto Ruins. There you will see first hand what the Star Sibyl and those summoners really did.${prompt}
  11001: The moon and the stars no longer smile upon Windurst. Now, the world shall kneel before the Yagudo!${prompt}
  11002: The bushin's so old that he's losing his eyesight!?${prompt}
  11003: |-
    <Sigh>
    Well, it has been thirty years. Just look at me. I'm not as young as I used to be.${prompt}
  11004: Ah, those were the days...${prompt}
  11005: |-
    What's this? You want to know what would impress the bushin? Hmmm...
    Well, when I was still his disciple, I once presented him with ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}.${prompt}
  11006: |-
    He was so pleased that he didn't just let me see the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, he let me try it on!
    I could feel the weight of the souls of all the bushin that had worn it before me.${prompt}
  11007: But that weight was too great for me, and ever since that day, I've been striving to improve my skills.${prompt}
  11008: But even now I don't think I could even grasp that belt with my own hands, let alone tie it around my waist. I still have much to learn...${prompt}
  11009: |-
    ...
    How many rounds have we gone now, ${name-player}...?${prompt}

    I remember every single blow, every tiny shift of your stance.

  11012: |-
    Now, I can't let such a great hero go home empty-handed.
    I've decided to grant you any one wish you ask of me.
    Don't get too exotic, though. I'm just an old man, not some Far Eastern genie!${prompt}

    Come on, then. No need to be shy.
    What's it to be?${prompt}

    ...!
    Take off my hat!?

  11015: It's not too late to change your mind, you know.${prompt}
  11016: 'There must be something else you want. A lifetime supply of Goblin chocolate? Afternoon tea with Princess Claidie? ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, perhaps? Or maybe ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}?${prompt}'
  11017: |-
    No? You've made up your mind, it seems.
    Young people these days--no imagination.${prompt}
  11018: |-
    But if that's what you really want, it makes things easy for me, I suppose.
    I'll give you one last chance to change your wish...${prompt}
  11019: Well, alrighty then.${prompt}
  11020: Are you ready?${prompt}
  11021: Try not to blink...${prompt}
  11022: |-
    Heh heh heh.
    Are you happy now? Bet you're thinking you should've changed your mind when you had the chance, huh?${prompt}
  11023: Aw, don't look so disappointed, ${name-player}. You think I'd let you walk away with nothing but an eyeful of my wrinkled noggin?${prompt}
  11024: Even the mightiest oak will wither with the passing of time. Its vibrant leaves will fade to brown, and crumble into dust. I, too, will one day have to leave this garden behind for good.${prompt}
  11025: Do you understand what I'm trying to say?${prompt}
  11026: |-
    When that time comes, I want you to take up this cap and become the mighty oak. Watch over the saplings as they reach towards the sky.
    I know you're up to the task, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11027: Do I have your word?${prompt}
  11028: Well, that takes a load off my mind.${prompt}
  11029: |-
    I've got plenty of spark left in me, though, so don't go getting ahead of yourself!
    I'll be around whenever you're ready for another bout. Heh heh heh!${prompt}
  11030: No one is allowed to meet with the archduke or the ducal scientists unless it absolutely necessary.${prompt}
  11031: The officials have been extremely busy making arrangements for numerous expeditionary forces to be sent to various locations around Quon and Mindartia.${prompt}
  11032: If you have any business with the archduke or the ducal scientists, please leave your message with us and we will relay it to the proper authorities.${prompt}
  11033: However, we cannot guarantee that you will receive a hasty reply.${prompt}
  11034: There is a man from the Alchemists' Guild who has been waiting to speak with the scientists for a number of days.${prompt}
  11035: I believe he is still waiting somewhere near the archduke's quarters. Pour soul...${prompt}
  11036: Did you hear? Some of the Telepoint crystals in Holla, Mea, and Dem have broken into a million pieces!${prompt}
  11037: So that's why Captain Wolfgang has been on edge lately... But what is really going on at those crags?${prompt}
  11038: I see you have begun to show some interest in the strange occurrences that have been taking place in the past few weeks.${prompt}
  11039: |-
    Let me tell you a little of what I have heard...
    Recently, the Duchy has been abuzz with strange tales of travelers being drawn into strange whirlpools located in the Valkurm Dunes and on Qufim Island...and never coming back.${prompt}
  11040: From what I gather, the ducal scientists believe this phenomenon has something to do with the shattered Telepoints at the Crags of Holla, Dem, and Mea.${prompt}
  11041: To collect data, a group of Ducal Guards is to be dispatched any day.${prompt}
  11042: |-
    Strange whirlpools in Valkurm and Qufim...
    Shattered Telepoints...
    What could it all mean?${prompt}
  11043: The investigatory report written by the Ducal Guards mentioned that the whirlpools in Valkurm and Qufim are made up of an unknown substance that they call the “Emptiness.”${prompt}
  11044: |-
    And now there are rumors stating that by jumping into these dark vortexes, people can instantly teleport themselves to the lost island of Tavnazia!
    I don't know about you, but I am staying right here where it is safe!${prompt}
  11045: I've heard rumors that a bright light shot out of the sea somewhere to the north of Delkfutt's Tower.${prompt}
  11046: An investigatory party is scheduled to search the area for clues, but they'll have their work cut out for them. The currents in the Sea of Shu'Meyo are unpredictable and violent. Many a captain has lost his ship in those waters.${prompt}
  11047: Did you know there is a mysterious group of officials in Jeuno known as the “Armathrwn Society”?${prompt}
  11048: The last time I tried telling some of the new recruits about the group, Captain Wolfgang put me on latrine duty for nine and a half weeks!${prompt}
  11049: You, a scruffy adventurer, spoke with Sir Nag'molada!?${prompt}
  11050: Did you know that he was a high-ranking member of the prestigious Armathrwn Society--the advisors to Archduke Kam'lanaut?${prompt}
  11051: Sir Nag'molada often speaks with common people of the Duchy. I even heard that promotions are granted to those who happen to impress him.${prompt}
  11052: I wonder if he will ever stop to speak with me... What would I say?${prompt}
  11053: You're an adventurer, right? So you've probably already heard about the humongous dragon that flew over the western skies.${prompt}
  11054: At first everybody thought it might be a stray wyvern, but there are rumors that it was actually one of those ancient “wyrms”!${prompt}
  11055: You want to know about the hooded officials in black robes that sometimes appear in the courtyard?${prompt}
  11056: They are all members of the Armathrwn Society--scientists working for the Duchy. I have heard that there are even quite a few female members.${prompt}
  11057: While the Jeuno Armada is making preparations for battle, it remains the duty of the Ducal Guard to ensure the safety of the citizens of Jeuno.${prompt}
  11058: Did you hear that a super-secret weapon was being loaded onto one of the warships? I wonder what it could be...${prompt}
  11059: Yes, I overheard some of the other guards mention that the society's scientists had built a terrifying new battle machine.${prompt}
  11060: Alright! After using that contraption, along with the airships' ultra-powerful mammoth cannons, there won't be enough left of those wyrms to even make dragon burgers!${prompt}
  11061: The Jeuno Armada is readying for an attack on the Wyrmking, Bahamut. However, there is nothing to worry about. Our forces are the strongest, most advanced in all Vana'diel.${prompt}
  11062: Have you seen a strange-looking boy or girl running about the gardens?${prompt}
  11063: If you have, inform one of the Ducal Guards. There are currently warrrrants out for both of their arrrrests.${prompt}
  11064: |-
    Their capture is crucial to the safety of not just Jeuno, but of all Vana'diel.
    You and your fellow adventurers' assistance in the matter is greatly appreciated.${prompt}
  11065: |-
    Members of the Armathrwn Society are to accompany the armada on its mission.
    It is said that the society's technological advancements are what built this city and made it what it is today.${prompt}
  11066: Lady Esha'ntarl is supposedly leading the mission against Bahamut. With such a skilled commander at the armada's helm, there isn't anything in Vana'diel that can stop the Duchy!${prompt}
  11067: I know you may consider your nation a powerful force in Vana'diel, but Jeuno is the only nation with the resources to defeat the Wyrmking. Don't you forget it.${prompt}
  11068: |-
    One of the armada warships is missing!
    With all the tightened security, how could anyone have pulled off a feat as grand as stealing an airship!?${prompt}
  11069: While the Jeuno Armada is conducting its mission in the skies, it remains the duty of the Ducal Guard to ensure the safety of the citizens of Jeuno.${prompt}
  11070: Did you find out anything more about the super-secret weapon the armada took with them?${prompt}
  11071: ' No... However, I did hear that the device dealt a severe blow to the mighty Wyrmking during the assault.${prompt}'
  11072: Wowzie! If I had an ultra-spiffy contraption like that, I'd be eating roast dragon burgers every night!${prompt}
  11073: The latest reports state the recent armada mission was a success. However, it did not completely stop the Wyrmking and his minions. It is rumored that the fleet will launch its second attack once the current repairs on the warships are completed.${prompt}
  11074: If you have any information on the whereabouts of the girl the Duchy was searching for, I am sorry, but the warrant for her arrest has been dropped.${prompt}
  11075: The Ducal Guard recently received news of her death...${prompt}
  11076: Even with the technology of the Armathrwn Society on our side, the armada was unable to completely defeat the Wyrmking and his army. Perhaps we underestimated their power...${prompt}
  11077: In its first wave of attacks, the armada was successful in dealing a large amount of damage to Bahamut. The Wyrmking will not stand a chance against the second wave.${prompt}
  11078: |-
    <Sigh>
    I requested a transfer from the Ducal Guard to the armada crew, but I was turned down...${prompt}
  11079: |-
    Why do I have to stand around the gardens while everyone else is having all the fun? Look at these biceps! I could take out a wyrm with one blow!
    Well...maybe two blows.${prompt}
  11080: We were beginning to wonder when you would arrive, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11081: The duke vicarious is meeting a messenger from the East as we speak. When she is finished, you shall be next. Until then, you shall be kept in custody.${prompt}
  11082: I apologize for the absence of Grand Duke Kam'lanaut. I, Esha'ntarl, shall serve in his stead.${prompt}
  11083: I hear that you have come from the Eastern Empire to ask something of our nation. State your name and your request.${prompt}
  11084: '...I am Tenzen. Born and raised in the Far East, I serve as a samurai under the mighty dynasty.${prompt}'
  11085: Lady Esha'ntarl, may I ask why my audience was not met by the duke himself?${prompt}
  11086: '${choice: 1}[Since the revival of the Shadow Lord/Even after the defeat of the Shadow Lord], the grand duke has been overwhelmed with his duties to the people of this land.${prompt}'
  11087: However, you need not worry. I will take the responsibility of relaying your words directly to Lord Kam'lanaut.${prompt}
  11088: These two shall be witness to that.${prompt}
  11089: '...${prompt}'
  11090: While short, my message is not a simple one. It is critical that the duke fully understands the grave nature of the situation that lies before us.${prompt}
  11091: What I am about to say does not only affect my homeland, but the countries to the south and west, as well as this fair land.${prompt}
  11092: |-
    The Emptiness is closing in.
    It has already appeared in the far reaches of the Eastern Empire. I can assume that the same is true of the outlying areas in the southern and western lands.${prompt}
  11093: The phenomenon started small, but in recent months it has begun to grow. Like sap oozes slowly from a tree, the Emptiness spreads across my country, swallowing whole the hills and forests.${prompt}
  11094: |-
    As it approaches, the children begin to dream.
    When it arrives, it is not long before the adults, too, begin to dream.${prompt}
  11095: |-
    The dream is always the same...
    It tells us...the Keeper of the Apocalypse will soon appear, and bring with him the end of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  11096: |-
    The Keeper of the Apocalypse...
    A frightening name, is it not?${prompt}
  11097: Your report of this “darkness”--this Emptiness--it is not news to us. In recent weeks, there have been reports of similar phenomena occurring in the areas around Jeuno.${prompt}
  11098: However, these reports state that the Emptiness, as you call it, is localized. That is why we have chosen to withhold this information from the public until it can be further researched. If it is true that the Emptiness has begun to spread, though, an immediate investigation may be necessary.${prompt}
  11099: Shall the Duchy prepare a team?${prompt}
  11100: |-
    ...
    You...do not know why the Emptiness has appeared?${prompt}
  11101: Unfortunately, our scientists have not yet come to any concrete conclusions. If your empire has any definite data, we would be delighted to hear it.${prompt}
  11102: Are you suggesting that the cause of the Emptiness may be found in my land? Do not tell me that you are unaware that the five shards of legend rest here!${prompt}
  11103: Do not tell me that you are unaware that it is the power of the five shards that protects Vana'diel from the Emptiness!${prompt}
  11104: |-
    Tenzen of the East...
    You are very straightforward with your accusations.${prompt}
  11105: |-
    Let me see...
    You feel that Jeuno is the cause of the Emptiness's growth.
    You feel that our attempts to harness the power of the crystals have resulted in the spread of the darkness, am I correct?${prompt}
  11106: Well, I am sorry to say that you are quite mistaken. Jeuno is fully aware of the power that the crystals radiate forth.${prompt}
  11107: The five shards--the mothercrystals--are what support our world.${prompt}
  11108: We, the Duchy, have taken it upon ourselves to inherit the will of the ancients and protect the Zilartian ruins and the crystals they hold.${prompt}
  11109: We have kept this information from the nations of Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria to shield the mothercrystals from those who may wish to wrongly use their power for personal gain.${prompt}
  11110: I see that the Eastern Empire has learned of the crystals' existence, and therefore we can no longer trust you, either.${prompt}
  11111: Jeuno cannot allow the power of the mothercrystals to fall into the hands of those who may exploit it.${prompt}
  11112: My country's only wish is to prevent the Emptiness from taking away any more than it already has!${prompt}
  11113: Seeing, with your own eyes, the darkness drain the life from your homeland... I can understand why you may not agree with our nation's stance.${prompt}
  11114: |-
    Very well. I can tell you one thing.
    The Duchy is currently in search of a boy. This boy is thought to be connected in some way to the Emptiness.${prompt}
  11115: Even though he is not one of us, he has already found a way into three of the Zilartian ruins, the Emptiness following in his path.${prompt}
  11116: We here believe that this boy is the Keeper of the Apocalypse of which you speak.${prompt}
  11117: |-
    A boy?
    Could he be a messenger from another nation?${prompt}
  11118: |-
    That we do not know.
    However...${prompt}
  11119: |-
    Wolfgang.
    Show the adventurer in.${prompt}
  11120: |-
    This adventurer was with the boy when he appeared near the mothercrystals.
    ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] hails from the nation of ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst].${prompt}
  11121: |-
    ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/The Republic/The Federation]!
    What could ${choice: 0}[the king/the president/those mages] be conspiring!?${prompt}
  11122: 'Of course, ${choice: 0}[the Kingdom/Bastok/Windurst] has denied all ties to the boy.${prompt}'
  11123: As has this adventurer.${prompt}
  11124: 'However, if we learn that ${choice: 0}[San d''Oria/the Republic/the Federation] is behind this threat to the mothercrystals and the well-being of all those residing on Vana''diel...${prompt}'
  11125: Whether allies or not, Jeuno will be forced to take action against the nation. We will destroy them.${prompt}
  11126: But this is still nothing more than speculation. If we had the time to conduct a proper investigation, it would be the first thing we did. Unfortunately, time is one luxury we do not have.${prompt}
  11127: And that is why we must capture the boy immediately to learn of what he knows...${prompt}
  11128: |-
    Exactly.
    And that is why I offer you a chance--a chance to prove your country's true intents by joining this battle to save your nation--no, all of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  11129: |-
    Adventurer.
    Travel to the fourth crystal and wait for the boy. When he arrives, capture him and bring him here.${prompt}
  11130: Unlike the first three crystals, the fourth lies deep beneath Vana'diel's surface, somewhere below the glaciers of the Northlands.${prompt}
  11131: Thirty years ago, an allied expedition visited the Northlands. If you could find one of the original members, you may be able to obtain some valuable information.${prompt}
  11132: |-
    Francmage M Mistalle, of the Knights Mistalle in San d'Oria...
    Iru-Kuiru, from the Rhinostery in Windurst...
    Mythril Musketeer captain, Ulrich, from Bastok...${prompt}
  11133: I have heard news that the criminal accused of destroying the Telepoints was captured and taken into custody.${prompt}
  11134: However, when questioned, ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] said she had nothing to do with the incidents. To prove ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] innocence, the Duchy has ordered the scoundrel to travel to the nations of Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria and gather information that will clear ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] name.${prompt}
  11135: What is this? You say you have business with the captain?${prompt}
  11136: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}.
    I was looking for you.${prompt}
  11137: Esha'ntarl, duke vicarious, would like to hear your account of what transpired in the Northlands.${prompt}
  11138: |-
    ...?
    What is this envelope?${prompt}
  11139: |-
    From Doctor Monberaux?
    Why would he...?${prompt}
  11140: |-
    However, first things first.
    Follow me.${prompt}
  11141: Ah, welcome back, adventurer.${prompt}
  11142: I see that you were unsuccessful in protecting the fourth crystal.${prompt}
  11143: And now it is looking more and more like you are the one who is leading the boy...${prompt}
  11144: Relax, adventurer. I am not blaming you for anything.${prompt}
  11145: Nag'molada kept the secret of the amulet to himself.${prompt}
  11146: It is his foolishness that acted as a catalyst for what occurred in the Northlands.${prompt}
  11147: And now that we know the true identity of the boy, there is no reason to further suspect your nation's involvement. I apologize for not trusting you.${prompt}
  11148: However, now we must put aside our misunderstandings and unite to save our world from being destroyed. Will you help us protect the mothercrystals?${prompt}
  11149: |-
    Join forces with Jeuno?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  11150: We have caused you much suffering, and I understand your anger. On behalf of the Duchy I ask for your forgiveness.${prompt}
  11151: ${name-player}...${prompt}
  11152: In the presence of the fourth crystal, I have learned that a strange occurrence took place.${prompt}
  11153: Is it true that the girl you took with you actually helped Selh'teus and thwarted the plans of our Nag'molada?${prompt}
  11154: It is extremely important that you do not withhold information from us.${prompt}
  11155: |-
    Is it true?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  11156: |-
    I see...
    The Duchy is currently searching for that girl.${prompt}
  11157: We do not wish to punish her. We feel that she may be in grave danger. We must find her so we can protect her.${prompt}
  11158: The first threat to her will be Nag'molada. He is already attempting to make it seem as if the fall of the fourth crystal was the girl's fault.${prompt}
  11159: If he finds her, he will more than likely poison her mind, preventing her from speaking of anything that may harm his plan.${prompt}
  11160: The second threat will be the boy, Selh'teus. His next destination will most surely be the fifth and final crystal.${prompt}
  11161: However, this crystal lies deep beneath the sea, and the only one who knows how to reach it is the girl.${prompt}
  11162: Finally, the third threat will consist of assassins from the south.${prompt}
  11163: You may have already heard the rumors of the Mithran sin hunters who have crossed the southern seas to try the theologians of Tavnazia.${prompt}
  11164: These hunters will not give up until they have punished all those they seek.${prompt}
  11165: And that is why we need your help, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11166: If you find the girl, bring her here. No harm will be brought to her. I swear on the name of the Goddess.${prompt}
  11167: Lady Esha'ntarl!${prompt}
  11168: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Did you tell them everything that happened in the Northlands?${prompt}
  11169: My plan was flawless! If it wasn't for that despicable girl, Prishe, I would have captured Selh'teus, and this whole ordeal would be solved!${prompt}
  11170: That girl heard the whisper of Selh'teus's soul, sang the “Memoria de la S^tona,” and helped him escape!${prompt}
  11171: The “testament of affinity” she possesses--it connects the hearts and souls of men. Selh'teus has been using that to control her!${prompt}
  11172: '...${prompt}'
  11173: But now we have the chance to find out his true intentions.${prompt}
  11174: If we can capture the girl, we can use her to tap into Selh'teus's mind. We can learn if he truly arrived to save Al'Taieu!${prompt}
  11175: |-
    You miserable man!
    Are you saying Selh'teus does not know that our crusade ended long ago?${prompt}
  11176: |-
    You fool!
    Are you saying Selh'teus does not know that the celestial capital was destroyed long ago?${prompt}
  11177: Perhaps it is we who do not know the true outcome of the crusade or the true fate of our capital!${prompt}
  11178: I propose that an expedition be sent to Al'Taieu.${prompt}
  11179: There we may find the answers to why Selh'teus survived all the centuries, and why he continues to poison the mothercrystals.${prompt}
  11180: And that is why we must first investigate the line leading to the fifth crystal.${prompt}
  11181: Please, grant me access to the Crystal Terminal!${prompt}
  11182: |-
    ...
    I understand why you feel an expedition to Al'Taieu is necessary.${prompt}
  11183: However...${prompt}
  11184: '${choice: 0}[The Armathrwn Society/Kam''lanaut] has already made a decision on this matter. I seem to recall that you have been given orders to research the Moblin city that was discovered near Bastok.${prompt}'
  11185: All affairs concerning Selh'teus have been left to Esha'ntarl. You are not to interfere.${prompt}
  11186: But, Lady Esha'ntarl has been given the assignment of Bahamut.${prompt}
  11187: Selh'teus is a much graver problem than you can imagine. I do not think...${prompt}
  11188: |-
    Yes, you do not think!
    Did you really believe attacking the boy with the Eye of Altana would defeat him!?${prompt}
  11189: Your impudence is the cause of all our troubles!${prompt}
  11190: But...${prompt}
  11191: 'Nag''molada, do not misunderstand us. ${choice: 0}[The society does/Kam''lanaut does] not intend to pry at your faults.${prompt}'
  11192: The reason we have entrusted you with the Moblin investigation is because your excellent Kuluu powers of negotiation are vital for the success of the mission.${prompt}
  11193: But Lady Esha'ntarl! You do not realize how powerful the boy has become...${prompt}
  11194: Now with the Eye gone and the path to the fifth crystal sealed, how do you plan on dealing with him!?${prompt}
  11195: I don't think you even have a plan!${prompt}
  11196: Very well, let me inform you of how we plan to stop Selh'teus.${prompt}
  11197: |-
    We can draw him forth without traveling to the fifth crystal.
    We can seal him without your precious Eye of Altana.${prompt}
  11198: H-how...!?
  11199: You can hear me, can you not...Selh'teus?${prompt}
  11200: It is I who possess the other amulet you seek.${prompt}
  11201: |-
    I am waiting, Selh'teus!
    Come and fulfill the pact!${prompt}
  11202: Here, take this envelope back to the doctor. It does not belong to me.${prompt}
  11203: But why would he try to...?${prompt}
  11204: Not but a few moments ago, Sir Nag'molada passed by this station. However, he did not seem himself. I wonder if something is wrong...${prompt}
  11205: Even Captain Wolfgang has been looking disturbed since he received that envelope. What ever could be going on?${prompt}

  11279: There is one thing that bothers me. Whatever happened to the original wielders of the weapons and armor that the beastmen there now possess? If the statues in the shape of Orcs and such were once actual beastmen, then...? But I get carried away with my musings.${prompt}
  11280: |-
    Please pay no mind to my ramblings.
    You have secured the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. An incredible feat. It proves the strength of your conviction, and is one of the keys you will need to enter Xarcabard.${prompt}
  11281: |-
    You will need four such trophies.
    Once you have them within your grasp, make your way to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. Cornelia awaits you there.${prompt}
  11282: I don't know about the other four, but I can't hear his voice anymore...${prompt}
  11283: Is this another brand I must bear for my treachery? I must truly be hated if that's the case.${prompt}
  11284: |-
    It is something I would wish for at the moment, however. I pray this silence is just a continuation of our incompatible personalities.
    If not, then it means his pronouncement has become reality...${prompt}
  11285: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    This is more than just a testament to your strength. It is one of the keys that will lead you to Xarcabard, along with the trophies of the other realms.${prompt}
  11286: |-
    When you have all four trophies, travel to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. You will find Cornelia waiting for you there.
    That is all the wisdom I have left to give you.${prompt}
  11287: |-
    What is the true nature of that other world? I can only explain it as a place that lies beyond the limitarus of our knowledge.
    But I'm sure I've feltaru that aura somewhere before...${prompt}
  11288: That's it. That protocrystal I came across when I was doing research in Elshimo. The magical emanations coming from the crystal gave me a similar impression. An avatar? No, that can'taru be...${prompt}
  11289: |-
    Oh! Oh, I'm terribly-werribly sorry!
    I appear to have driftarued into my old habits.${prompt}
  11290: |-
    Now, ${name-player}.
    This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is both a symbol of your fortitude, and one of the keys that will help you gain access to Xarcabard. The trophies from the other three realms carry the same importance.${prompt}
  11291: Gather all four trophies and hurry yourself on to Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia will be waiting for you when you get there. But be wary, ${name-player}. The blackness enveloping that world grows ever deeper, ever darker...${prompt}
  11292: The beastmen of that world carry the spoils of prrrevious battles. Equipment that you or I would use.${prompt}
  11293: I'm not able to touch them in my prrresent form, but I feel something about those weapons and armor...something extrrraordinary.${prompt}
  11294: |-
    Wait, wait, wait!
    I don't mean that they're currrsed or anything like that! It's something more like, um, not ominous, but...
    How can I explain it?${prompt}
  11295: Anyway! They're not evil, just...you know? Different from other normal swords and things. Being all ghostlike and stuff, you can feel things like that.${prompt}
  11296: |-
    But enough of that kinda talk--congrrratulations are in order!
    You've got your paws on the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! It shows you've got the goods in the hero department, and it will also help you get into Xarcabard.${prompt}
  11297: But first you've got to collect the other three trophies and then hightail it to snowy Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia should be up there waiting for you.${prompt}
  11298: "${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and the four trophies.\nThese artifacts have long been lost to that other world. \nThe Hydra Corps was a unit formed after our expedition to the Northlands.${prompt}"
  11299: |-
    It must have been in the time of the Great War...
    Nobody knows how the Hydra artifacts came to be there, but those five trophies will open the path for you.${prompt}
  11300: Each of these items holds a measure of power. However, the strength of a single artifact is limited.${prompt}
  11301: |-
    The ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} and the ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.
    Combining these separate entities created a bridge from Vana'diel to the other realms.
    Xarcabard, I'm afraid, is another matter entirely...${prompt}
  11302: |-
    Unless the shroud of darkness is lifted, that power alone will not be enough to open the way.
    However, the five trophies resonate with another artifact that lies within his land. If we can join our strength to theirs...${prompt}
  11303: Let us make haste to the land where this all began. To Xarcabard...${prompt}
  11304: Is it over...?${prompt}
  11305: No, the rage has merely been dispersed.${prompt}
  11306: As long as I exist, he will never truly die...${prompt}
  11307: Or perhaps an eternal soul is something beyond the concept of death?${prompt}
  11308: |-
    ${name-player}...
    You have achieved an incredible feat--the unification of the Shadow Lord has been prevented.
    I have not the words to express my gratitude.${prompt}
  11309: |-
    The power of the crystal has faded, but I will be drawn into that towering rage no more.
    I have heard the voice of the one who holds sway over this realm...${prompt}
  11310: The one who holds sway...?${prompt}
  11311: |-
    Yes. From the center of infinite darkness.
    I was in a place beyond comprehension when those words reached into my mind...${prompt}
  11312: |-
    You who have touched the crystal, the one who holds immortal power within a mortal shell.
    The rage that has arisen from your twisted core will devour my world.${prompt}
  11313: |-
    It was an error in judgment to shelter you...
    The order of my realm has been disrupted.${prompt}
  11314: |-
    I give to you a duty...
    You will stand vigil until an age without hatred has dawned.${prompt}
  11315: |-
    No matter what terrible power you might wield, there is no escape from Dynamis for an incomplete soul.
    No return to the land of blessed light...${prompt}
  11316: |-
    What manner of being was this who spoke from a pit of blackness?
    As this question gnawed at my mind, the voice grew quiet, leaving me in unanswered silence.${prompt}
  11317: |-
    Of one thing I was certain.
    This voice belonged to the ruler of Dynamis.${prompt}
  11318: A flow of energy exists in Vana'diel that has escaped the notice of those who dwell there.${prompt}
  11319: |-
    Thirty years past, my contact with the crystal caused an accelerated change in this flow.
    It was as if it had leapt forward, rushing along a deliberate course.${prompt}
  11320: |-
    Nobody knows what lies at the end of this journey.
    Perhaps it will reveal the true nature of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  11321: ${name-player}, you may be the one to witness this truth.${prompt}
  11322: |-
    The power stored in the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will soon be drained.
    And I must remain in this world in my role of observer.${prompt}
  11323: |-
    Do not forget who you are, ${name-player}.
    I bid farewell to a most heroic adventurer.${prompt}
  11324: My old companions...?
  11325: |-
    This duty is too much for just one to bear.
    If you will have me, I will stand at your side until an age without hatred has arrived.
    It pains me to see the depths to which my country has fallen.${prompt}
  11326: That is my only reason for staying. Do not misunderstand my motivations.${prompt}
  11327: |-
    Blessed light and the ruler of Dynamis?
    I do believe you've rekindled my long-forgotten sense of adventure.${prompt}
  11328: |-
    Once I've gotten all firedy-up, even you can'taru keep me back, Raogrimm.
    I'm sure my incomparable research skills will be of use in your task.${prompt}
  11329: |-
    C'mon, let's see a little excitement!
    This is our expedition's thirty-year rrreunion.${prompt}
  11330: |-
    It's not the Northlands this time.
    None of us are going to grow old and die, so who else would you want with you on a task as long as this one?${prompt}
  11331: |-
    I'm not gonna back down, no matterrr how much you complain.
    Better just give in and accept the fact that you're stuck with me.${prompt}
  11332: |-
    I thought this would be the end of you for sure...
    Hmph. You're just as thick-skinned as you used to be.${prompt}
  11333: |-
    What, no words for an old friend?
    Thinking about testing your theory on whether or not a soul can be killed?${prompt}
  11334: |-
    I betrayed you!
    I extinguished the light of your precious Cornelia!
    The man responsible for this entire nightmare stands right before you!${prompt}
  11335: |-
    Everything began thirty years ago.
    And there were things that came to an end...
    Even though I was a prisoner of uncontrollable rage, the fact remains that I took the lives of my companions with my own hands.${prompt}
  11336: And yet, my old companions, you are the ones who have saved me from falling into that pit of hatred a second time.${prompt}
  11337: |-
    I have words of gratitude, but do not stand in a position to blame anyone for their actions.
    No matter who that person may be.${prompt}
  11338: Raogrimm...${prompt}
  11339: |-
    Are you sure you want to do this?
    This duty will continue until hatred has faded from the land.
    As long as my divided soul remains, there may never be an end to that rage...${prompt}
  11340: |-
    Raogrimm.
    There is no need to suffer alone anymore.
    Our presence here should answer your question.${prompt}
  11341: |-
    There are crimes that must be atoned for.
    And if that means staying on after death and watching over this world, then we who were your companions will share the burden along with you.${prompt}
  11342: |-
    Until the dawn of an age without hatred...
    No, as long as this world continues to be, I will remain by your side.${prompt}

  11362: I see that you have gathered three slivers of black crystal...${prompt}
  11363: The Emptiness is sealed inside of them. Those are no mere fragments.${prompt}
  11364: |-
    Those pieces of crystal have led you to this place...
    The source of this nightmare is near. I can feel the dreamer's presence.${prompt}

    The entrance to the dream has already been opened.
    Find and destroy the source if you wish to protect my realm.${prompt}

    No, there was one more, transformed after death...${prompt}

    The dreamer is not the girl who once harbored the Emptiness...

  11534: |-
    Every time ${item-singular: 0[2]} is reborn it gains a new wielder, who ultimately must pass it on to a successor.

  11568: Well, I have no more use for this weapon, so I guess you can have it. But there is one thing I want you to remember.${prompt}
  11569: This gun is a fearsome weapon that unleashes a blast upon your enemies many thousands of times greater in strength than the tiny effort it takes you to pull the trigger. Needless to say, be careful who you aim it at...${prompt}
  11570: '...${prompt}'
  11571: A weapon has no will of its own. But it was made for a purpose.${prompt}
  11572: Take me to a new battlefield, a new arena for the hunt...${prompt}

    ...
    I am saved.${prompt}
  11574: Silenced for too long in the prison of Dynamis, I can once again let my brazen call echo through this land!${prompt}

  11633: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  11634: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  11635: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  11636: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  11637: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  11638: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  11639: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  11640: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  11641: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  11642: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  11643: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  11644: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  11645: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  11646: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  11647: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  11648: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  11649: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  11650: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  11651: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  11652: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'

  11656: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  11657: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  11658: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}

  12005: Ballista is an exercise once used by the San d'Orian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word “ballista” means “to throw a stone,” and the game has been a part of Vana'dielian military history for centuries.${prompt}
  12006: |-
    The rules are simple.
    Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vana'diel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.${prompt}
  12007: 'Players from both teams must search for ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} that a ${color: 5}Herald${color: 1} has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12008: 'These ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} into them.${prompt}'
  12009: Finally, a player's strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.${prompt}
  12010: '${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the ${color: 5}Quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.${prompt}'
  12011: 'Sometimes a player may find items other than ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}, such as potions. These ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).${prompt}'
  12012: |-
    Players can carry more than one ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, but they cannot throw the stones away once they have obtained them.
    However, players will lose their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} if they:
    (1) Successfully throw them into a rook.
    (2) Leave the area.
    (3) Are knocked out.${prompt}
  12013: 'But don''t forget, a player will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command while in possession of a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. And, players can only use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command if they carry one of the stones.${prompt}'
  12014: As one can see, careful planning and impeccable timing are the keys to victory.${prompt}
  12015: 'All participants of Ballista will have the ability to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. This will temporarily increase one''s movement speed, creating a better chance to find and obtain ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12016: 'However, remember that once a player has obtained a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, he or she will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. In its place, though, one may use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command.${prompt}'
  12017: 'The locations of the ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} are constantly changing. This makes it quite difficult to find the targets by just randomly walking about the area.${prompt}'
  12018: 'Communication with one''s team members is, of course, one way to locate ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}. However, another way is by using the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command. This will inform a player of the approximate location of the nearest ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12019: 'Finally, ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} can only be used when a player is carrying a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. Because ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used at this time, players must be weary of approaching enemies.${prompt}'
  12020: 'So, a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} has been obtained and a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1} located. Now all that''s left is tossing the stone in, right? Wrong.${prompt}'
  12021: There is one aspect of Ballista that has yet to be mentioned...and this is where the real battle begins.${prompt}
  12022: 'To throw a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} into a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}, a player must first wait until the ${color: 5}Rook''s${color: 1} gate is open. This takes impeccable timing, as the gate is only open for a short while.${prompt}'
  12023: |-
    But not just anyone can score points this way. A player must first take down a member of the opposing team and achieve ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status.
    Only then will his or her shots count.${prompt}
  12024: This extreme method of combat is what made the ancient game of Ballista famous, and transformed its participants into heroes.${prompt}
  12025: Running about looking for stones is no different from a child's game of hide-and-seek. Knowing when to strike is what separates the men from the boys.${prompt}
  12026: |-
    The following match types are area-specific:
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Allowed: Jugner Forest
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Restricted: Pashhow Marshlands
    Best of Three (three matches) * Normal Items Allowed: Meriphataud Mountains${prompt}

    ${color: 5}Best of Three${color: 1} series rules are as follows:
    Winning a match will earn a nation one “match point.” The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for “come-from-behind” victories.${prompt}
  12028: Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nation's forces.${prompt}
  12029: Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.${prompt}
  12030: When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.${prompt}
  12031: For more information on temporary items, refer to the “special rules.”${prompt}
  12032: After being KO'd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.${prompt}
  12033: If a player chooses to return to their force's camp, HP and MP will be fully restored, but all TP will be lost.${prompt}
  12034: |-
    Please note that many of the rules previously considered “special” have been fully implemented.

  12037: 'Players can hold up to ten ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1}, but only one of each type. If a player finds an item that they already possess, they must use it immediately or throw it away.${prompt}'
  12038: 'If players who possess ten ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} find an item that they have not already obtained, they will also have the option to exchange it with one of their current items.${prompt}'
  12039: Also, players will not, at any time, be allowed to trade temporary items. However, there are items that can be used on other Ballista participants. Please note that players may not be able to use these special items as soon as they are quarried.${prompt}
  12040: 'Finally, the Heralds will collect ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} when the match (the third in a Best of Three series) has concluded.${prompt}'

    I've discovered a way to increase the potential of those who have reached their “limits.” However, I haven't found anyone to pass that method on to, kupo.
    Hey, you look pretty tough. How would you like to be my guinea...errr, assistant?${prompt}
  12111: |-
    Wait a minute! I remember you!
    I already filled you in on the secrets of the Moogle Merit Management system, kupo! Stop wasting your time here; get fighting, kupo!${prompt}

    Excellent, kupo...
    Ahem! I shall now pass on to you the secrets of the “Moogle Merit Management” system. Use this legendary method to extend your limits. Watch as your strength soars beyond the stars, kupo!${prompt}
  12114: Now, when the level of your main job has reached 75 or higher, a new button, “Merit Points,” will appear under “Status” in the main menu.${prompt}
  12115: Press this button to change experience accumulation modes as well as adjust skills and attributes. Just remember, you can only adjust your attributes while in your Mog House or Mog Garden, kupo!${prompt}

    Oho, kupo! Or perhaps you're looking to transcend your limits?

  12124: Or perhaps you've finally mustered the courage to conquer your inner limits, kupo?${prompt}
  12125: |-
    Before you rush into anything, let me inform you of the disclaim...errr, the details of the method, kupo.
    Have you ever stopped to wonder what happens to all the experience you accumulate after maxing out your level?${prompt}
  12126: 'In recent months, I have discovered that this type of experience builds up in your body in a completely different form--a type of super experience, if you will. I have given this phenomenon the name ${color: 5}limit points${color: 1}, kupo!${prompt}'
  12127: When you accumulate ten thousand of these points, they are magically transformed into an even more super type of experience--super-duper experience, if you will. I call these ultra-special points “merit points,” kupo!${prompt}
  12128: But that is not all I have discovered. I think I have also come across a method to manage those points and use them to boost the levels of your body and mind beyond their current limits! I call it “Moogle Merit Management,” kupo!${prompt}
  12129: |-
    I can tell by the look on your face that you're pretty interested, kupo.
    So, what would you like to know?${prompt}
  12130: |-
    Ask about...
    ${selection-lines}
    How to accumulate merit points.
    How to adjust attributes.
    Nothing at this time.${prompt}
  12131: Well, you already know that by reaching level 75 you're ready to start collecting limit points, right, kupo?${prompt}
  12132: Well, before you begin, don't forget that you have to press the “Merit Points” button in the “Status” menu.${prompt}
  12133: It only appears when your main job is level 75 or higher, kupo.${prompt}
  12134: By pressing this button, you can toggle between “experience point accumulation mode” and “limit point accumulation mode,” kupo.${prompt}
  12135: In experience point accumulation mode, you will gain normal EXP after every battle until you reach the maximum...${prompt}
  12136: '...while in limit point accumulation mode, you will receive limit points after every battle. It''s that easy, kupo!${prompt}'
  12137: Oh, and by the way--if you are still in experience point accumulation mode after you've reached your maximum amount of EXP, any battles fought from that moment on will earn you limit points, regardless of the mode you are in, kupo!${prompt}
  12138: Normally, you can only accumulate limit points when you're playing a job that has reached level 75 or higher. However, there is one exception, kupo!${prompt}
  12139: When a job capable of receiving limit points has been reduced via a level restriction, you can still earn limit points by defeating enemies!${prompt}
  12140: Just don't forget to switch modes before heading out on a hunting trip! When you're in limit point accumulation mode, the color of the text in the “Status” window will change a little to let you know, kupo!${prompt}
  12141: Finally, if you level down or switch jobs while in limit point accumulation mode, you will automatically be switched back to experience point accumulation mode.${prompt}
  12142: 'Ah, and one more point of advice: You can always check the amount of limit points and merit points you have earned by viewing the “Merit Point” menu.${prompt}'
  12143: Ummm, first of all, you can check the number of merit points you have accumulated by pressing the “Merit Points” button under “Status” in the main menu.${prompt}
  12144: The data I have collected so far tells me that it is quite difficult to raise these attributes, and that there seems to be a limit to the amount any certain attribute can be boosted, kupo.${prompt}
  12145: It also seems that certain attributes and skills are connected in some way. I call these groups “categories.”${prompt}
  12146: 'For example, imagine the attributes in the “HP/MP” category can be raised a ${color: 5}“combination”${color: 1} of seven times, kupo.${prompt}'
  12147: That means if you raise your “Max HP” five times, you can only raise your “Max MP” two times.${prompt}
  12148: In other words, you cannot raise all of the attributes to their limits. The body must maintain a certain balance, or it will explode! Or something like that, kupo.${prompt}
  12149: There is also a way to lower attributes that have been pushed past their limits. Unfortunately, every time this is tried, the merit points used to originally raise that attribute are lost, kupo...${prompt}
  12150: Oh, and finally, there are some attributes and skills in the same category that have different limits. I'm still not sure about all of these, so I'd suggest asking some of your level 75 buddies for advice, kupo!${prompt}
  12151: |-
    Hrm?

    I had a feeling that's what you'd say, kupo!
    Well, Maat? How about it?${prompt}
  12154: We stand on the cusp of a new era. It's the Goddess-given duty of an old warrior like me to prepare the younger generation to follow in my footsteps. And who better than a young ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who's met every challenge sent ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] way?${prompt}
  12155: You can say that again, my friend!${prompt}
  12156: No doubt you've heard of the mog tablets--those stone slabs engraved with the timeless wisdom of King Kupofried the Great that have been popping up periodically throughout the land.${prompt}
  12157: |-
    The tablets hold many secrets that we moogles have yet to unravel, kupo.
    Why are our wings purple? Why are our noses red? How can we better assist our adventuring friends?${prompt}
  12158: Why, I was just having a discussion with a friend of mine from the Magian Mooglehood on the very subject... That's when it hit me on the head like a herd of hecteyes!${prompt}
  12159: What if the ancient moogle arts could be used to augment not only adventurers' possessions, but the adventurers themselves, kupo!?${prompt}
  12160: |-
    Using my knowledge of merit points--and drawing upon the martial mastery of Maat here--I've whipped up a method that just might work!
    What say you, adventurer? Care to be my test subject?${prompt}
  12161: |-
    'Course, nobody'd blame you for not trustin' the little devil.
    I'm not even sure I do. Heh heh heh...${prompt}

    ${selection-lines}

  12164: |-
    Marvelous! Magnificent!
    First, I'll need you to bring me ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt}
  12165: |-
    They're needed to channel the ancient moogle magic, you see.
    You'll also have to accumulate ${number: 0} merit point${choice-plurality: 0}[/s] to provide the necessary energy to trigger the reaction, kupo.${prompt}
  12166: |-
    I'll be sittin' this one out, I fear.
    I may have mastered the martial arts, but I know better than to get mixed up with moogle mumbo-jumbo. Heh heh heh...
    Now go get 'em!${prompt}
  12167: |-
    Say it ain't so, kupo!
    Ah, but it is not a moogle's place to question the judgment of an accomplished adventurer such as yourself.
    Come back if you ever have a change of heart.${prompt}
  12168: 'Have you acquired the ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} and ${number: 2} merit point${choice-plurality: 2}[/s] needed to transcend your limits, kupo?${prompt}'

  12179: <Mumble, grumble>... I am ready, kupo.${prompt}
  12180: |-
    Excellent! Our magian friend here will fire a potent dose of moogle magic directly at you.
    All you have to do, my dear adventurer, is stay alive! Easy breezy, wouldn't you say, kupo?${prompt}
  12181: Now, kupo!
  12182: (This is reckless even for these moogles. Sends a shiver up my spine, it does...)${prompt}
  12183: '${color-alt: 15}${name-player} feels a sudden surge of power well up from the pit of ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] stomach, coursing through ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] veins and limbs...!'
  12184: Kupo-ho! It would seem the procedure has gone off precisely as we predicted!${prompt}
  12185: That it has, kupo. I must say, the sheer stamina of these adventurers never ceases to astound me.${prompt}
  12186: |-
    My friend, you've been the perfect test subject...<ahem>...I mean, you are clearly an ideal heir for the powers of the moogle ancients.
    Should our research bear further fruit, you shall be among the first to know!${prompt}
  12187: |-
    But why are you still standing around here?
    There's a whole new world waiting for you to explore, kupo!${prompt}
  12188: Your level limit is now 80!
  12189: |-
    Let me guess, kupo.
    You have caught word of my latest miraculous method for padding the already-puissant powers of adventurers like yourself.${prompt}
  12190: Yes, the positively esurient expression on your face tells me all I need know.${prompt}
  12191: Is there no point at which your penchant for power will be sated, kupo?${prompt}
  12192: It cannot be easy, walking around as a veritable avatar of avarice and avidity.${prompt}
  12193: |-
    Still, I've taken a liking to your kind, kupo.
    And since you were such a wonderful guinea pig last time, I'd be positively elated to experiment upon you again!${prompt}
  12194: |-
    That said, I must warn you that I'm still working out some of the kinks.
    I can give you no guarantees this time.${prompt}
  12195: That is to say, don't come crying to me if your level of strength ends up plunging precipitously, kupo!${prompt}
  12196: Are you still keen for the challenge?${prompt}
  12197: |-
    Give it a go, kupo?
    ${selection-lines}
    Will I ever!
    On second thought...${prompt}
  12198: |-
    Ever the confident one, I see.
    Very well! Go procure the ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} needed for the procedure...${prompt}
  12199: '...And store your spiritual energies to the tune of ${number: 0} merit ${choice-plurality: 0}[point/points], and we''ll give it a go, kupo!${prompt}'

    You sure you want to go ahead with this, ${name-player}?
    This moogle mumbo-jumbo gets sketchier and sketchier each time, if you ask me.${prompt}
  12201: |-
    Is that so? Very well.
    I cannot fault you for exercising a modicum of moderation, kupo.${prompt}
  12202: 'Have you acquired the ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} and ${number: 2} merit point${choice-plurality: 2}[/s] needed to transcend your limits?${prompt}'

  12204: |-
    Or did you just drop by to ask me about merit points?
    Because I would be happy to oblige, kupo.${prompt}
  12205: 'My latest marvel of moogle magic requires ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} and ${number: 2} merit point${choice-plurality: 2}[/s], kupo.${prompt}'

    Splendid! Superlative!
    In that case, without further ado...${prompt}
  12207: |-
    Yoo-hoooooo! Mister Magian Moogle man!
    Over here, kupo!${prompt}
  12208: |-
    Yes, yes... I'm coming already.
    And keep your voice down, will you? I could hear your hooting and hollering from a malm away, kupo...${prompt}
  12209: (Seems the poor fella's resigned himself to his fate...)${prompt}
  12210: |-
    Same deal as last time. Got it, kupo?
    And today, we'll also be recruiting the services of a very special guest!${prompt}
  12211: Howdy-ho, fatty-watties!${prompt}
  12212: Ladies and gentlemoogles, I proudly present Parike-Poranke, esteemed researcher of enterological magic from the Windurstian Orastery, who was kind enough to take time away from his data-gathering for this especial occasion, kupo!${prompt}
  12213: |-
    (Parike-Poranke? The self-styled brown mage?
    Why do I get the feelin' we're in for a real mess this time...?)${prompt}
  12214: Honored to be here, my pudgy purple-winged friends!${prompt}
  12215: |-
    I've been hopin' to test out my latest laxative spell, but lately my lab's been as barren as a set of freshly evacuated bowels.
    This is just the belly-bursting opportunity I've been looking for!${prompt}
  12216: |-
    ...Ahem. To make room for a fresh fount of power inside you, we must first expel the old.
    A simple truth, no, kupo? ${prompt}
  12217: (Ulp... My stomach's gettin' queasy just thinkin' about it.)${prompt}
  12218: '...${prompt}'
  12219: |-
    ...Very well. Come and kneel down right before me, ${name-player}...
    Parike-Poranke, you may take your position over there.${prompt}
  12220: |-
    Alright!!!
    Prepare to have your innards turned inside out!${prompt}
  12221: And you, my friend, prepare to unleash the most vigorous volley of moogle magic you can manage, kupo.${prompt}
  12222: |-
    ...Understood.
    I am ready whenever the rest of you are.${prompt}
  12223: |-
    Then let us begin!
    (Gee, I sure hope this works, kupo...)${prompt}
  12224: |-
    Bulging...belly...!
    (Was that it...? Bah, never mind!)
  12225: BURST!!!!!!
  12226: '${color-alt: 15}${name-player} is racked with pain as ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] stomach gurgles and grumbles violently!'
  12227: Now! Now, kupo!
  12228: '${color-alt: 15}${name-player} feels a gushing fount of power explode from ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] bowels, coursing through ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] veins and limbs...!'
  12229: |-
    Success! Ahahaha, glorious success!!!
    The last time I tried that one, I was scrubbing my lab clean for a month!${prompt}
  12230: (I don't know who's more frightening, this fellow or the moogle who brought him here...)${prompt}
  12231: |-
    (How curious. The more excruciating the pain they endure, the stronger these adventurers grow.
    Perhaps my trials are not as torturous as they should be...?)${prompt}
  12232: |-
    Ahem...er, nothing. Nothing at all!
    You look in fine fettle, my adventuring friend.
    Go out there and get 'em! Farewell, kupo!${prompt}
  12233: |-
    I can't thank you enough! Why, you've given me enough data to write a year's worth of reports.
    Next time you're feeling a little backy-wacked up, you know who to call! Ta-taru!${prompt}
  12234: Rejoice, ${name-player}, for the procedure was a staggering success!${prompt}
  12235: |-
    Whole new horizons await you out there, and I suspect you're feeling famished.
    Go and feast to your heart's content!${prompt}
  12236: Your level limit is now 85!
  12237: |-
    Great King Kupofried's ghost! Look who's back, and right on schedule.
    However do you always know when to come here, kupo?${prompt}
  12238: |-
    We inflict upon you progressively more profound pain each time, and still you come back for more.
    Are you perhaps a practitioner of a certain Far Eastern religious discipline?${prompt}
  12239: |-
    Or perhaps you were simply dropped on your head as a child.
    Yes, that seems the more likely answer.${prompt}
  12240: But hey, it's your bruised and battered body, not mine, kupo.${prompt}
  12241: Either way, you'll be pleased to know that the previous two experiments are going to feel like child's play compared to what we have in store for you this time.${prompt}
  12242: |-
    And though you'll indubitably ignore me, it's my duty to warn you.
    There's no guarantee things will go as smoothly as last time, kupo.${prompt}
  12243: |-
    If you ask me, you're lucky that crazy moogle magic ever worked.
    I'd think twice about this if I were you...${prompt}
  12244: So how about it, kupo?${prompt}
  12245: |-
    Test your limits?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course!
    On second thought...${prompt}
  12246: "How did I know you'd say that? \nVery well. To power the process this time, we'll be needing ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt}"
  12247: |-
    And you'll need to prime your own physical energies by storing up ${number: 0} merit point${choice-plurality: 0}[/s].
    No exceptions, kupo.${prompt}
  12248: I've got a bad feeling about this...${prompt}
  12249: |-
    Taking a pass today, are we?
    Fine with me. No fur off my back, kupo.${prompt}
  12250: Phew... That's a relief.${prompt}
  12251: |-
    ${choice-player-gender}[He/She]'s back!
    Are you ready with the ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} and ${number: 2} merit point${choice-plurality: 2}[/s] that we need?${prompt}
  12252: 'If so, trade the ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to me and we''ll get this show on the road, kupo.${prompt}'
  12253: |-
    Or did you come to hear me talk about merit points?
    Because I can do that too, kupo.${prompt}
  12254: |-
    I'm afraid your physical energies are not sufficiently primed.
    Remember, you need ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} and ${number: 2} merit point${choice-plurality: 2}[/s] if you want to test your limits.${prompt}
  12255: |-
    Well, it looks like you're all ready.
    And if you're ready, why, I'm more than ready.
    <Ahem>... Yoo-hoooooo, kupoooooo!${prompt}
  12256: |-
    What's this? Has our guest of honor stood us up?
    For shame, kupo!${prompt}
  12257: |-
    Ah, well. We still have plenty of firepower at our disposal here.
    Let's get the ritual rolling...${prompt}
  12258: |-
    ...Oh, how I've waited for this day!
    Hah! Yah!${prompt}
  12259: '!?'
  12260: |-
    Ten years. Ten long years I walked through fire and ice, subjected my body and mind to the harshest of trainin'.
    All for the day--the glorious day--when I could settle the score with you. Maat...prepare yourself!${prompt}
  12261: What!? M-me?${prompt}
  12262: |-
    Oh, do forgive me, Mister Degenhard.
    I neglected to notify you that ${name-player} here would be your opponent today.${prompt}
  12263: Maat... I face my battles with honor. The battle garb I wear is proof enough of that.${prompt}
  12264: |-
    I thought you a worthy opponent, and yet you summon me all the way to Jeuno on some cruel jest?
    In all my long years, I have never suffered such dishonor!${prompt}
  12265: |-
    For this, you will get no mercy from me!
    No mercy!!!${prompt}
  12266: |-
    Wait a minute, old friend!
    What is this talk of settling scores? Why, I never--${prompt}
  12267: |-
    Hah! Do not play the fool, Maat!
    It was written plain as day on your letter of challenge.
    “If you think yourself worthy of wearing ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, you must defeat me in single combat!”${prompt}
  12268: |-
    (Whoever could have penned such a preposterous missive?
    Oh, that's right...it was me, kupo!)${prompt}
  12269: |-
    You break your promise, now I break you! Like you break your promise.
    Hieeeeee-yah!${prompt}
  12270: W-wait, Degenhard. This...this is madness!${prompt}
  12271: |-
    Oh, good gracious me, ${name-player}!
    He's preparing to come at Maat with every technique both in and out of the book, kupo!${prompt}
  12272: |-
    If Maat doesn't unleash his own ultimate moves, he's as good as done for!
    We must help him, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  12273: |-
    Look closely at the two masters, kupo.
    See how they each emit an aura? That's a sign that a no-holds-barred showdown between techniques of inconceivable power is on the way!${prompt}
  12274: |-
    There are three types of auras, indicating three of the most advanced, awe-inspiring bushin techniques.
    But here's the key, kupo: though they are equal in power, each technique is ascendant over another.${prompt}
  12275: The “Raging Beast” devours the “Silent Wind,” but is quelled by the “Soaring Dragon,” kupo.${prompt}
  12276: The “Silent Wind” swallows up the “Soaring Dragon,” but is quelled by the “Raging Beast,” kupo.${prompt}
  12277: The “Soaring Dragon” devours the “Raging Beast,” but is swallowed up by the “Silent Wind,” kupo.${prompt}
  12278: |-
    We are dealing with two martial arts masters here, kupo.
    An attack from an equal or inferior position will be easily deflected by the opponent.${prompt}
  12279: Only by assuming a position of advantage will the attacker be able to break his opponent's defenses!${prompt}
  12280: Now, are you ready, kupo!?${prompt}
  12281: |-
    Ready, kupo!?
    ${selection-lines}
    Heeeeee-yah!!!
    W-wait a minute...!${prompt}

    I don't know how long I can hold them...

  12283: |-
    Are you two done yappin'?
    Then prepare to die, coward! Hah! Eeeeee-yaaaaaah!${prompt}

    About merit points...
    Goodbye.${prompt}
  12362: |-
    Now that's the answer I was looking for!
    Very well, then! I'll just be needing a few things from you.
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, to startaru. Ah yes, and a healthy-wealthy dose of intestinal fortitude.${prompt}
  12363: |-
    “Intestinal fortitude,” kupo...?
    That's an awfully ambiguous order, my diminutive friend.${prompt}
  12364: |-
    One would think you'd have a bit more imagination in that swollen-wollen head of yours.
    I speak, of course, of the “marinara points” you always requestaru of these adventurers.${prompt}
  12365: |-
    Ah, mouthwatering morsels of select seafood and pasta boiled to perfection...!
    ...Ahem. Do you perhaps speak of “merit” points?${prompt}
  12366: |-
    Hmm? As I was saying, ${number: 0} of those whatchama-pointarus along with the items of which I just spoke.
    Round these up, and our contract is as good as signed--and I won't even need to take your soul.
    Ahem, I mean, we'll be ready to roll.${prompt}
  12367: |-
    And with that, I'm going back to the inn before the vixens vacate!
    Drop a linkshell line to my assistantaru when this ${choice-player-gender}[fellow/lady] is ready, mister moogle man.${prompt}
  12368: Far be it from me to keep you from your destiny, ${name-player}, but this technique the Tarutaru speaks of...${prompt}
  12369: |-
    Ah, but never ye mind...just an old man's worries.
    Trust your heart and follow your own path. It won't lead you astray.${prompt}
  12370: 'To recap, you''ll be needing ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${number: 2} marinara--I mean merit ${choice-plurality: 2}[point/points].${prompt}'
  12371: |-
    Bring these to me, and I'll contact the miniature master.
    Understood, kupo?${prompt}
  12372: |-
    Why yes, that should be everything.
    Now where did I put my linkshell, kupo...?${prompt}
  12373: '...${prompt}'
  12374: |-
    Curses and criminy, late again!
    Does that Taru's disregard for decorum know no bounds!?${prompt}
  12375: |-
    Heh, speak o' the devil.
    And don't look now, but he's brought a friend...${prompt}
  12376: 'Hmph! And give me justaru one good reason why your associates won''t help sell my scrumptious ${item-plural: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  12377: |-
    I could give you a thousand-wousand reasons, my dear, but what would be the pointaru?
    The higher-ups would never listen to a second-string flunky like me!${prompt}
  12378: |-
    And would it kill you to try to negotiataru!?
    After all the time you've spent there, surely you know how to deal with those costive-wostive easterners!${prompt}
  12379: |-
    And what's in it for me? Hmmm?
    Why, I don't even like pickles! Yeech!${prompt}
  12380: |-
    Ah, the tragedy of it all!
    It's common knowledge that the pickle-hater misses out on at least eighty percentaru of life's pleasures!${prompt}
  12381: Ah, but the remaining twenty percent tastes infinitely as sweetaru, untainted by the sour, unsavory flavor of those foul foodstuffs!${prompt}
  12382: |-
    I, for one, am developing an exceedingly unpleasant taste in my mouth just listening to this pointless palaver.
    Is this young lady your assistant, kupo?${prompt}
  12383: |-
    Ah, forgive me.
    This is Chumbawumba, a purveyor of pickle-wickles who--as you can see--is most desperataru to distribute her wares.${prompt}
  12384: |-
    That's Chamama!
    And I'll have you know that I run a perfectly reputable restaurantaru!${prompt}
  12385: |-
    But my assistant...yes, of course!
    How's this, Ms. Chulapalooza? You lend me a hand, and I'll see if I can't talky-walky the boss into selling your rancid rations.${prompt}
  12386: |-
    That's Chamama! And “rancid”...!
    ...W-wait. You'd do that for me?${prompt}
  12387: |-
    Of course, my dear assistant!
    Now step rightaru this way, won't you?${prompt}
  12388: Something about this is tying my sensitive stomach in knots, kupo...${prompt}
  12389: |-
    ${name-player}, listen well. My ancient Eastern technique will trigger a miracu-waculous process inside your body.
    You might feel a bit odd at first, but pay it no mind.${prompt}
  12390: |-
    Incubate it carefully, and then, when the urge calls, I want you to squeeze with all your mightaru!
    Succeed and you will expel the physical embodiment of the profound life energies that lie dormantaru within you.${prompt}
  12391: |-
    It's all in the timing. Ten beats of your heart--ten seconds--should do the trick.
    Discharge it too early and it will disintegrate into dustaru. Wait too long and we'll have a foul mass as rotten-wotten as Chupawupa's pickled rodent tails.${prompt}
  12392: |-
    Hmm? Discharge what? No need to sweataru the details, friend!
    Anyhoodles, as a final step, my lovely-wovely assistant will weigh your, er, evacuated matter.
    I daresay three pickling stones' weight would do just perfectly.${prompt}
  12393: |-
    Well, aren't you in luck!
    I have a supply of ${item-plural: 0[2]} right here.${prompt}
  12394: |-
    Perfect! Now remember, ${name-player}. It's all in the mind.
    When you make that all-important push, envision something...cutesy-wutesy.
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, for example.${prompt}
  12395: Cutesy-wutesy...?${prompt}
  12396: |-
    I recommend you take a momentaru to catch your breath, ${name-player}.
    When you're ready, just speak to our frizzy-furred friend here, okay?${prompt}
  12397: |-
    Ready?
    ${selection-lines}
    Come again?
    Ready!
    Maybe another time.${prompt}
  12398: |-
    Well, look who's back.
    Ready to give my technique a shot, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  12399: |-
    Splendid!
    I shall signal the start of the procedure, kupo.${prompt}
  12400: |-
    All rightaru, ${name-player}!
    On our moogle friend's mark...!${prompt}
  12401: Here we go, kupo!
  12402: |-
    When you get the urge...
    ${selection-lines}
    Push!${prompt}
  12403: '...'
  12404: '...?'
  12405: |-
    ${color-alt: 15}A discolored mass is released from ${name-player}'s body.
    It quickly decomposes and dribbles off....
  12406: |-
    Eew! Stinky-winky, ${name-player}.
    I told you what would happen if you waited too long.${prompt}
  12407: |-
    ${color-alt: 15}Something begins to poke out from ${name-player}'s body.
    It quickly crumbles and dissipates into the air...
  12408: |-
    No, no, ${name-player}! Weren't you listening-wistening?
    You must hold it in longer!${prompt}
  12409: '${color-alt: 15}A curious mass is released from ${name-player}''s body...'
  12410: |-
    Well, well...this looks most promising indeed!
    Ms. Picklemonger, the weigh-in!${prompt}
  12411: That's Cha... Oh, just let me see that already!${prompt}
  12412: |-
    One stone, two.
    Yes, it looks like we have...${prompt}
  12413: |-
    Oh dearie-wearie me.
    I'm afraid it's just a trifle-wifle too light.${prompt}
  12414: |-
    Let's see, now.
    Heave...ho!${prompt}
  12415: |-
    Oh, heavens no.
    This is simply-wimply too heavy for an exquisitaru lady like myself to carry.${prompt}
  12416: |-
    No, this won't do at all.
    Once more from the beginning!${prompt}
  12417: '${color-alt: 15}The unidentified mass vanishes.'
  12418: Just what was that strange stone, kupo...?${prompt}
  12419: Ugh! I thought this was difficult to do, but it's even more difficult to watch!${prompt}
  12420: |-
    Well, ${name-player}?
    I'm ready-weady when you are!${prompt}
  12421: |-
    Could it be? Yes, I think it could!
    Three stones' weight and not an onz more!${prompt}
  12422: |-
    ${choice-player-gender}[He's/She's] done it!
    To think I'd live to see the day...${prompt}
  12423: |-
    This sleek oblong shape, this glossy sheen!
    I'm simply-wimply smitten!${prompt}
  12424: |-
    And just what is ${name-player} supposed to do now!?
    King Kupofried forbid, you can't expect ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] to...eat it!?${prompt}
  12425: |-
    Oh, good heavens no!
    This is where I unleash my final technique, just like so...${prompt}
  12426: '${color-alt: 15}The unidentified mass transformed into a shimmering crystal!'
  12427: |-
    Congratulations, ${name-player}.
    You have tapped into a power that few mortal-wortals have.${prompt}
  12428: 'Atori-Tutori hands the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to ${name-player}.'
  12429: |-
    Keep this stone close at hand for the rest of your days.
    As for the nature of its powers... I'll just leave that to your imagination.${prompt}
  12430: |-
    Are we done here?
    I've got pecks of pickled rarab tails to sell, and I'm not getting any younger!${prompt}
  12431: |-
    Very well. Let it not be said that Atori-Tutori doesn't keep a promise.
    May we meet again, ${name-player}. Ta-taru!${prompt}
  12432: '${color-alt: 15}Atori-Tutori winks knowingly in ${name-player}''s direction.'
  12433: |-
    Whatever is the matter, Maat?
    You're looking positively pale, kupo...${prompt}
  12434: |-
    It's nothin'. Nothing at all, I say...
    Urgh, I think I've lost my appetite...${prompt}
  12435: |-
    ${name-player}. Only the terminal trial awaits you now.
    I suspect we shall meet again before long, kupo.${prompt}
  12436: Your level limit is now 95!
  12437: |-
    I have a letter for you here from none other than Atori-Tutori.
    It reads, ahem...${prompt}
  12438: “Howdy, ${name-player}. How's my favorite indentured servantaru doing these days?${prompt}
  12439: |-
    “Having fun with your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?
    Well, you're in luck, because your master has another treat for you today.${prompt}

    “First, though, I'll be needing something from you: ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, to be exact.
    Track one down and trade it to our furry friend, here.${prompt}
  12441: |-
    “In return, I'll... Oh, but that would spoil all the fun, wouldn't it?
    Ta-taru for now!”${prompt}
  12442: |-
    A present! How positively fascinating...and frightening.
    Whatever could it be?${prompt}
  12443: And the item he speaks of, kupo...${prompt}
  12444: |-
    Heh heh. This would seem t' be a warm-up for your next trial, ${name-player}.
    I reckon you'll be able to find what ye seek from any enemy that's at least an even match for ye, if ye know what I mean.${prompt}
  12445: |-
    Anyhow, we'll be waiting for you here.
    Happy hunting, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  12446: Shall I read Atori-Tutori's letter again, kupo?${prompt}
  12447: |-
    Read the letter?
    ${selection-lines}
    Please do.
    No need.${prompt}
  12448: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}...
    Yes, this should do!${prompt}
  12449: Did you face any problems procuring it, kupo?${prompt}
  12450: |-
    Atori-Tutori's been waiting for quite some while, you see.
    He seemed a tad...testy, so do take care.${prompt}
  12451: |-
    There you are, ${name-player}.
    I was starting to think you had--Goddess forbid--forgotten the terms of our contractaru.${prompt}
  12452: |-
    I trust you still have your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?
    Hand it over, if you would.${prompt}
  12453: |-
    Such a lovely shimmer and sheen.
    Yes, I reckon-weckon you're ready to face your ultimate challenge--me.${prompt}
  12454: |-
    Or, how shall I say it...a part of me?
    After all, were I to unleash my full strength, I might mistakenly blastaru you into dust with an errant tap of my pinkie-winkie finger.${prompt}
  12455: |-
    Accept the challenge?
    ${selection-lines}
    But of course!
    Maybe another time.${prompt}
  12456: |-
    Don't tell me you're thinking of reneging on our contract, ${name-player}.
    That would make me mostaru unhappy...and you don't want to see me unhappy.${prompt}
  12457: |-
    I understand. These things take time.
    Friends and family to say farewells to, last will and testament to draftaru...
    Just don't keep me waiting for long.${prompt}
  12458: Are you ready to meet your mak--er, your final challenge, kupo?${prompt}
  12459: |-
    That's the spiritaru!
    Then prepare yourself and meet me at a suitable venue--Horlais Peak, Waughroon Shrine, Balga's Dais, or Qu'Bia Arena should suffice.${prompt}
  12460: |-
    Toodle-woodles for now, my mangy confrere.
    Don't forget to furnish our friend here with the present I left for ${choice-player-gender}[him/her].${prompt}
  12461: |-
    Consider yourself lucky, kupo!
    It's rare indeed that Atori-Tutori offers to go mano a mano with an adventurer like you.${prompt}
  12462: '...${prompt}'
  12463: |-
    Maat?
    Is something the matter, kupo?${prompt}
  12464: At long last, the time has come...${prompt}
  12465: |-
    I can offer no advice but this, young one.
    Ready yourself in body and mind, and prepare for the fight of your life.${prompt}
  12466: |-
    Kupopopo... What is this oppressively ominous mood?
    No siree, this simply won't do!${prompt}
  12467: |-
    So here's some advice of my own.
    Find yourself some friends to bring to the battle, kupo!${prompt}
  12468: Up to five shouldn't give that overconfident Taru cause to complain...much.${prompt}
  12469: |-
    Oh, and ${name-player}, don't forget this.
    It's a personal present from Atori-Tutori himself!${prompt}
  12470: 'Word has it its energies will be released when paired with ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  12471: |-
    Oh, and if you're looking for a lift, I can moogle-magick you to your final showdown in two shakes of a rarab's tail.
    What do you say?${prompt}
  12472: |-
    Where to, kupo?
    ${selection-lines}
    Horlais Peak.
    Waughroon Shrine.
    Balga's Dais.
    Qu'Bia Arena.
    Nowhere yet.${prompt}
  12473: |-
    Is that so?
    Then come back whenever you're ready, kupo.${prompt}
  12474: |-
    Then away you go!
    It was nice knowing you, kupo!${prompt}
  12475: Anyhow, if you're feelin' the butterflies before the battle o' your life, ${name-player}, why don't you pay ol' Degenhard a visit?${prompt}
  12476: |-
    Hah! Yah! Can't ye see I'm... Wait a minute.
    I almost didn't recognize ye...${prompt}
  12477: |-
    Looks like someone's come a long way since our last meetin'.
    Why don't I give ye somethin' that might help in yer training?${prompt}
  12478: |-
    But first, I'm gonna need proof that ye're ready.
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} should do the trick.${prompt}
  12479: |-
    Don't ye give me that face.
    It's trainin'--it ain't supposed to be easy!${prompt}
  12480: |-
    Well, looks like someone's ready for ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] next challenge.
    As promised, here's somethin' for ya.${prompt}
  12481: |-
    It's a present from our friend Chamama.
    As for how it's going to help yer trainin', ye've got me...${prompt}
  12482: |-
    Kupopopo...
    Those bumps and bruises...don't tell me you failed, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  12483: |-
    Don't get too down and discouraged. Atori-Tutori is a formidable foe, after all.
    Fortunately, he's supplied me with ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} to spare!${prompt}
  12484: However, I fear I can't offer them for free...${prompt}
  12485: |-
    Atori-Tutori made me promise to exact a payment of ${number: 1} merit point${choice-plurality: 1}[/s] or ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.
    He says it's part and parcel of your training, kupo.${prompt}
  12486: |-
    Why, you already possess ${number: 1} merit point${choice-plurality: 1}[/s], you say!?
    Would you like to use ${choice-plurality: 1}[it/them] right away?${prompt}
  12487: |-
    Spend ${number: 1} merit point${choice-plurality: 1}[/s]?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  12488: Whenever you're ready, I'll be here, kupo!${prompt}
  12489: 'Excellent! ${number: 1} merit point${choice-plurality: 1}[/s] paid, and the deal is done, kupo!${prompt}'
  12490: 'Splendid! ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}, and the deal is done, kupo!${prompt}'
  12491: 'As promised, here''s a spare ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} from my stock.${prompt}'
  12492: Will you be heading straight to the showdown?${prompt}
  12493: Kupo-ho? Have we met, kupo?${prompt}
  12494: |-
    Wait... Could it be?
    ${name-player}...?${prompt}
  12495: Ye've done it! Ye've truly done it!${prompt}
  12496: Oh, ${name-player}! I knew all along that if anyone could wipe the smirk off that self-satisfied Taru's face, it would be you!${prompt}
  12497: Though I must confess some curiosity as to the conditions of that “contractaru” you signed, kupo...${prompt}
  12498: Heh... If y' must know...${prompt}
  12499: It involves bein' woken up at the crack o' dawn for sparrin' matches after doin' a hundred push-ups on your knuckles...${prompt}
  12500: Eatin' all the rarab tails delivered to the Tenshodo from one of Atori-Tutori's acquaintances...${prompt}
  12501: Wranglin' herds of wild sheep and countin' them one by one whenever he can't sleep...${prompt}
  12502: |-
    ...'n much, much worse.
    Sends a shiver through these old bones just thinkin' about it...${prompt}
  12503: |-
    Egads, kupo!
    That is a most appalling arrangement indeed!${prompt}
  12504: |-
    Wait a minute.
    How is it that you're privy to all those particulars, Maat?${prompt}
  12505: |-
    Hm!? R-rumors, that's all!
    When ye've been around as long as I have, ye hear a thing or two!${prompt}
  12506: |-
    Anyway, enough talk!
    My daily trainin' regimen calls!${prompt}
  12507: |-
    Come now, ${name-player}.
    It's no time for slumping shoulders and sunk spirits.${prompt}
  12508: |-
    After all, I'm sure it's all part of your training.
    Keep it up, and you'll be positively pulsating with power in no time flat!${prompt}
  12509: |-
    You were right, old friend.
    I never thoughtaru ${choice-player-gender}[he'd/she'd] come this far...${prompt}
  12510: |-
    That's my ${name-player}.
    In all the time I've known ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], I've never once known ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] to back down from a challenge.${prompt}
  12511: Why, when I think back to the days when ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] was still a rookie with more ambition 'n sense...${prompt}
  12512: |-
    ...<Sniff>...
    That's odd, seems t' be some water in my eyes...${prompt}
  12513: Save those tears, Maat.${prompt}
  12514: While ${name-player}'s achievements are admirable indeed, those adventurers who strive to reach the pinnacle of their powers remain few and far between.${prompt}
  12515: |-
    We must not ease up on them.
    For it is in their hands that the fate of our Vana'diel lies...${prompt}
  12516: Your level limit is now 99!
  12517: |-
    Speak of the ${choice-player-gender}[savior/starlet], kupo.
    I just overheard an earful of an engaging exhortation on “${color: 5}job points${color: 1}” and figured it was imperative that I inform you immediately!${prompt}
  12518: Accomplished adventurers such as yourself can accrue these points by progressing prolifically in their professions. But beware, for the road is rockier than anything related to limit points, kupo.${prompt}
  12519: '...However, I''m confident you''ll conquer the cornucopia of crimps and clogs that could block your way to glory.${prompt}'
  12520: |-
    Do you believe you have what it takes?
    ${selection-lines}
    Without a doubt!
    Not at the moment...${prompt}
  12521: |-
    That's what I wanted to hear, kupo!
    Your sheer determination fairly fills me with a fulgent felicity.${prompt}
  12522: Henceforth, you shall be able to select “Job Points” under the “Status” menu as long as your main job has the reached the resplendent realm of level 99, kupo.${prompt}
  12523: You can fervently fiddle with your faculties there, but only while inhabiting the interior of your Mog House or galavanting about your Mog Garden.${prompt}
  12524: The ${name-npc} casts a strange and slightly unnerving spell upon you.${prompt}
  12525: Hmph, and here I hypothesized you were brimming with boldness and bravery. Well, just talk to me when your gut gives you the go sign, kupo!${prompt}
  12526: |-
    ${name-player}.
    What business do you have here today?
    If you seek Captain Wolfgang, he is currently...${prompt}
  12527: |-
    You are here about the girl, Prishe?
    And the warrant for her arrest?${prompt}
  12528: She presented herself at the palace of her own free will, not so long ago.${prompt}
  12529: Naturally, she was taken into custody, but her demands for an audience with a higher authority are becoming increasingly vocal.${prompt}
  12530: I wonder if Captain Wolfgang will return from his duties any time in the near future...${prompt}
  12531: ${name-player}!${prompt}
  12532: I apologize for interrupting your conversation, but...could you walk with me for a moment?${prompt}
  12533: Why would Prishe surrender herself so easily...?${prompt}
  12534: I have no idea what she could be thinking.${prompt}
  12535: Thank the mercy of Altana that Prishe has escaped any punishment while the Jeunoan government is occupied with other matters.${prompt}
  12536: If we could only use this opportunity to rescue her somehow...${prompt}
  12537: |-
    ${name-player}!
    Lady Ulmia!
  12538: Tenzen!${prompt}
  12539: |-
    I am glad to have found you.
    You have heard of young Lady Prishe's predicament?${prompt}
  12540: We need to gather everyone together to unite our actions and plan our next move.${prompt}
  12541: The rest of our friends are waiting in a tavern in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}
  12542: A tavern in Upper Jeuno...?${prompt}
  12543: Aldo has used his influence to secure the establishment for our exclusive use, if only for a short while.${prompt}
  12544: |-
    I will await you on the premises.
    Until then.${prompt}
  12545: What could be the purpose for this meeting being held at the Marble Bridge in Upper Jeuno?${prompt}
  12546: If that Aldo is involved, I am positive it cannot be anything good. Just keep me out of it. If I lose this job, I'm through!${prompt}
  12547: ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12548: |-
    I must apologize for my childish behavior.
    I never should have run off in such a flustered state.${prompt}
  12549: I do understand what everyone is saying.${prompt}
  12550: I understand that the Wyrmking, Bahamut, plans to obliterate all the peoples of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  12551: Even with the might of the Jeuno Armada, many more innocent lives will be lost in this conflict if something is not done.${prompt}
  12552: And I do understand that everyone truly wishes to rescue Prishe from her destiny...${prompt}
  12553: |-
    However, it is as Lord Diabolos has said.
    We cannot save both the world and all of her people.${prompt}
  12554: |-
    Lord Diabolos...
    I wonder if he called Prishe into his dreamworld because he knew the truth of her identity--that she is the Keeper of the Apocalypse.${prompt}
  12555: |-
    Was Cardinal Mildaurion also aware of this truth?
    Is that why she gave Prishe that amulet?
    But I still...${prompt}
  12556: ${name-player}, it may be too late at this point, but there is something I must tell you.${prompt}
  12557: When Prishe had collapsed, and her amulet was stolen...${prompt}
  12558: It was only for a second, but I'm pretty damn sure.${prompt}
  12559: |-
    The presence I felt when the amulet was stolen...
    It was definitely Miss Mildaurion!${prompt}
  12560: You're saying that Cardinal Mildaurion took the amulet from you?${prompt}
  12561: |-
    Why would she act in such a manner?
    Did not the cardinal give the amulet to you as a gift?${prompt}
  12562: |-
    Yeah, she did.
    Miss Mildaurion was always watching over me through the amulet.${prompt}
  12563: She was always making sure I wasn't thinking of doing something stupid or getting myself into trouble.${prompt}
  12564: But she needed to take the amulet back.${prompt}
  12565: An old, old friend she'd waited a long, long time for had finally returned...${prompt}
  12566: |-
    She apologized to me in her thoughts.
    Said that I would be safe while I was in Jeuno...${prompt}
  12567: But then...${prompt}
  12568: Cardinal Mildaurion would have known that we, the survivors of the Great War, were unable to leave the island...${prompt}
  12569: |-
    She knew, but she did not come to help us.
    She abandoned us to our fate...?${prompt}
  12570: |-
    No, I don't think so.
    Miss Mildaurion left it to me.${prompt}
  12571: Left what to you...?${prompt}
  12572: What was Prishe about to say, I wonder.${prompt}
  12573: |-
    What could Cardinal Mildaurion have entrusted to us?
    Surely not the resurrection of the Twilight God...?${prompt}
  12574: It might be naive of me to believe that you are on my side.${prompt}
  12575: However, I am not willing to give up.${prompt}
  12576: I want to sing of a world where both Vana'diel and all of her people are saved.${prompt}
  12577: Will you dream of such a world alongside me?${prompt}
  12578: |-
    Do you dare to dream?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I'll fight to the end!
    Reality is not that kind...${prompt}
  12579: Thank you, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  12580: |-
    I am sorry.
    I have asked too much without considering your feelings.${prompt}
  12581: |-
    I will once again go to the Grand Duke Palace.
    I've not found anyone in town who has information, but Makki-Chebukki and the others have probably tracked down some rumors.${prompt}
  12582: |-
    There must be something we can do to save Prishe...
    There must be someone who knows of the cardinal...${prompt}
  12583: |-
    ${name-player}!
    What are you doing here!?${prompt}
  12584: Have you found some means to stop the Wyrmking, Bahamut?${prompt}
  12585: |-
    The battle will soon begin.
    An airship carrying a group of adventurers was downed in an attack by the wyrms.${prompt}
  12586: We have completed preparations on the warships, and nothing remains to be done.${prompt}
  12587: |-
    Only...
    I don't know if this is good news or bad news to you, but the commander of the Jeunoan Armada, Lady Esha'ntarl, is nowhere to be found!${prompt}
  12588: |-
    Lord Nag'molada has also disappeared without so much as an escort...
    Dammit! This wouldn't be your doing, would it!?${prompt}
  12589: |-
    Is this your doing?
    ${selection-lines}
    All part of my plan.
    Of course not!${prompt}
  12590: |-
    Please, ${name-player}, this is no time for sarcasm.
    Forgive my wild accusations.${prompt}
  12591: |-
    My apologies.
    You must forgive my wild accusations.${prompt}
  12592: No matter how much one despises senseless bloodshed, there are few who can stand by while their home is burned to the ground.${prompt}
  12593: And so, if it means saving Jeuno from the wyrms, I have no choice but to cooperate with this race of ancients.${prompt}
  12594: |-
    Captain Wolfgang!
    The criminals who escaped with warship zero-three have been identified!${prompt}
  12595: |-
    It appears to be the work of those three Tarutaru!
    We have a witness who overheard them talking about heading to a place they referred to as the “fated land.”${prompt}
  12596: |-
    They took a warship!?
    Is it possible they know where our missing officials have disappeared to!?${prompt}
  12597: |-
    And where is this “fated land” they spoke of!?
    Split up and find some answers!${prompt}
  12598: Where could this “fated land” be? I wouldn't even know where to start looking.${prompt}
  12599: But now that I think of it, I could have sworn I heard that name somewhere before... Where was it...?${prompt}
  12600: |-
    You adventurers are quick to hear the news!
    Lady Esha'ntarl has returned to us!${prompt}
  12601: The Jeunoan Armada has been authorized to begin an assault on the wyrms!${prompt}
  12602: |-
    We are conducting final flight inspections on all vessels.
    Please keep out of the way and allow the engineers to do their job.${prompt}
  12603: Waaah! <sniff>
  12604: Waaah! <snuffle>
  12605: Waaah! <gurgle>
  12606: |-
    What a racket.
    Those Tarutaru were punished for their crimes of stealing a warship and flying out of Jeuno.${prompt}
  12607: 'They claim they were just following orders, but Lord Nag''molada is also awaiting disciplinary action to be decided by the ${choice: 0}[Armathrwn Society/archduke].${prompt}'
  12608: No matter your position, if you break the law...${prompt}
  12609: Hm? Isn't that lady a friend of yours?${prompt}
  12610: Oh, you three!
  12611: Whatever is the matter?${prompt}
  12612: |-
    Come now, no more tears.
    Surely things are not that bad?${prompt}
  12613: We're done for.${prompt}
  12614: Our necks are on the chopping block.${prompt}
  12615: We've gotta get out of here!${prompt}
  12616: |-
    Whatever for?
    There are rumors all over town about the brave Tarutaru who saved an important official.${prompt}
  12617: Is there some other terrible failure that you are regretting?${prompt}
  12618: |-
    No, we've done everything right.
    We used the right blend of deceit and betrayal, honey and vinegar...${prompt}
  12619: We bribed the townsfolk, and avoided the authorities...${prompt}
  12620: We've groomed ourselves into the perfect candidates to become bureaucrats of the future...${prompt}
  12621: They have to run off because I showed up.${prompt}
  12622: Prishe!?${prompt}
  12623: |-
    What the hell is wrong with you!?
    If you keep this up, I'm gonna start rethinking my plan to put you in charge of Tavnazia.${prompt}
  12624: |-
    Get yourselves together, or I'm gonna kick you into next Watersday!
    You have a responsibility to look out for Ulmia and everyone else in the Marquisate!${prompt}
  12625: Wh-what?${prompt}
  12626: Sorry to fly off without an explanation, Ulmia.${prompt}
  12627: |-
    And you, ${name-player}.
    Thanks for worrying about me.${prompt}
  12628: |-
    There's not much time, but I'll tell you what I know.
    Get yourselves to the audience chamber.${prompt}
  12629: Prishe...?${prompt}
  12630: |-
    Ah, that energetic young Elvaan girl just entered the audience chamber.
    Hmmm... I thought she had been taken into custody...${prompt}
  12631: With all the preparations for the launch of the armada, there are currently few people remaining in the Grand Palace. I wonder who gave the girl permission to enter...${prompt}
  12632: |-
    Hello, Ulmia.
    You've been through quite an ordeal.${prompt}
  12633: C-Cardinal Mildaurion...!?${prompt}
  12634: What is going on...?${prompt}
  12635: |-
    I am sorry, Ulmia.
    We don't have time for lengthy explanations.${prompt}
  12636: However, there is one thing that I must tell you.${prompt}
  12637: My true name is Esha'ntarl.${prompt}
  12638: Ten thousand years ago I was born in Al'Taieu, the city that enfolds the fifth mothercrystal.${prompt}
  12639: Nag'molada, and the other members of the Armathrwn Society that now govern Jeuno, are also of an ancient race of people--a race recently awoken from a centuries-long sleep.${prompt}
  12640: |-
    But I am different from the others.
    Through an unusual twist of fate, I was granted immortality.${prompt}
  12641: '!?${prompt}'
  12642: I pledged to use this unending life to bring to fruition the pact made between Selh'teus and the terrestrial avatars.${prompt}
  12643: |-
    After the passing of ten thousand years, a child of destiny would be born in the fated land.
    The Keeper of the Apocalypse...the one I have sworn to destroy.${prompt}
  12644: I have spent many years preparing for the coming of the keeper.${prompt}
  12645: It has been an incredibly long journey.${prompt}
  12646: I have traveled to the far reaches of Vana'diel in search of lost secrets...${prompt}
  12647: I have found solace and encouragement in the many encounters I have had along the way...${prompt}
  12648: But then, when I came to a certain place, I was warned:${prompt}
  12649: Destroying the Keeper of the Apocalypse will merely set the darkness free to reincarnate in another body.${prompt}
  12650: To break this cycle, the darkness itself must be obliterated.${prompt}
  12651: It must be erased from the place where all life originates and where all life eventually returns--the mothercrystal.${prompt}
  12652: To fully eradicate the darkness, the Keeper of the Apocalypse must be destroyed not in the form of a human, but in the form of a god.${prompt}
  12653: That is why I conceived a plan to use the Lay of the Immortals to resurrect Promathia.${prompt}
  12654: Resurrection...and destruction...?${prompt}
  12655: But that plan eventually failed.${prompt}
  12656: At the baptismal ceremony, I...${prompt}
  12657: At that time, I was having my strings pulled by the Emptiness inside me.${prompt}
  12658: I lived in the Tavnazian Cathedral since the time of my earliest memories, and believed that the Gates of Paradise must be opened.${prompt}
  12659: But as my bad luck would have it, the Emptiness inside me reacted to the baptismal vessel and was sealed within this magicite.${prompt}
  12660: |-
    My world was tipped upside down.
    I was suddenly able to read people's thoughts and, just like Cardinal Mildaurion, I never aged another day.${prompt}
  12661: |-
    So that is what happened.
    You were the Keeper of the Apocalypse...${prompt}
  12662: |-
    But things are different now.
    You are no longer the one, are you?${prompt}
  12663: '...${prompt}'
  12664: Are you saying that nothing has changed? What is to happen to Prishe?${prompt}
  12665: Judging by the actions of Bahamut, the keeper is still among us.${prompt}
  12666: But over the last twenty years I have watched over the lands of Vana'diel, I have seen no other possible incarnations...${prompt}
  12667: Bahamut wishes to see me smashed to bits in the form of the Twilight God.${prompt}
  12668: It was Diabolos that let me in on my destiny as the Keeper of the Apocalypse.${prompt}
  12669: It is my fate to be destroyed along with this magicite, and set adrift from the cycle of the mothercrystal.${prompt}
  12670: No! This is too horrible!${prompt}
  12671: |-
    Listen to me, Ulmia.
    We've come pretty far in this quest.
    I've already heard four of the verses needed to resurrect the Twilight God.${prompt}
  12672: Once we have the last verse, we can finally stand before Bahamut...!${prompt}
  12673: |-
    Please, Prishe!
    Do you hear what you are saying!?${prompt}
  12674: |-
    How can I let you offer your very existence to Promathia?
    There must be another way...!${prompt}
  12675: |-
    Calm yourself, Ulmia.
    Prishe will not be coming with us.${prompt}
  12676: The last verse of the “Memoria de la S^tona” no longer exists, and there is no weapon left to battle the Twilight God.${prompt}
  12677: Pitting the full force of Jeuno against the wyrms is our only recourse.${prompt}
  12678: There is no other way to save the children of Altana from extinction.${prompt}
  12679: But Miss Mildaurion! What about me?${prompt}
  12680: |-
    Lady Esha'ntarl!
    The Jeunoan Armada is prepared for battle!${prompt}
  12681: |-
    I must go.
    Beyond the sea of endless clouds.${prompt}
  12682: Cardinal Mildaurion!${prompt}
  12683: |-
    Prishe. Ulmia.
    It is only a matter of time until Jeuno becomes a war zone.${prompt}
  12684: I will prepare an airship for your return to Tavnazia.${prompt}
  12685: Protect that which is most dear to you.${prompt}
  12686: |-
    Dammit!
    There's no way in hell it's ending this way!
    It's time to put it all on the line!${prompt}
  12687: Prishe!?${prompt}
  12688: |-
    ${name-player}!
    Ulmia!${prompt}
  12689: I know you guys can do it!${prompt}
  12690: You're strong enough now to beat the hell out of me when I become Promathia...${prompt}
  12691: |-
    Listen, there is someone in Selbina who knows the fifth verse.
    Her memory is a little shoddy, though...${prompt}
  12692: Find the fifth verse!${prompt}
  12693: |-
    I need you to do this!
    You hear me!?${prompt}
  12694: |-
    I cannot...!
    Prishe, wait!${prompt}
  12695: Ulmia, I have heard the entire story.${prompt}
  12696: Louverance!?${prompt}
  12697: |-
    This must be the guidance of Altana.
    The girl with a “shoddy memory” in Selbina is well known to me.${prompt}
  12698: |-
    And I also happen to possess the means to revive her past.
    Let us be on our way.${prompt}
  12699: |-
    What?
    Is there a girl in Selbina with a serious case of amnesia?${prompt}
  12700: |-
    How would I know? I'm always confined to my post here in Jeuno.
    You're the adventurer. Why don't you know these things?${prompt}
  12701: Those three Tarutaru brought to Jeuno by Nag'molada have been granted amnesty by Lady Esha'ntarl.${prompt}
  12702: However, I don't believe they have much of a future here in the Duchy.${prompt}
  12703: 'Once you have angered ${choice: 0}[the Armathrwn Society/the archduke], it would take no less than a miracle to regain ${choice: 0}[their/his] trust.${prompt}'
  12704: |-
    ${name-player}!
    It appears you caught up with the armada.${prompt}
  12705: |-
    I heard the report.
    The attack against Bahamut failed, but we have dealt him a critical blow.${prompt}
  12706: Lady Esha'ntarl is to join the main fleet and lead our forces in a mass assault.${prompt}
  12707: |-
    She mentioned that she would like to meet with you all before the attack commences.
    You are to meet her for a confidential briefing in the tavern in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}
  12708: |-
    Do not keep Lady Esha'ntarl waiting.
    May victory in battle be yours.${prompt}
  12709: Captain Wolfgang has asked me to remind you that you are to hurry to the Marble Bridge in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}
  12710: It sounded as if it was urgent. You had best be on your way!${prompt}
  12711: Recently, there have been no signs of Nag'molada or those annoying Tarutaru entering the Grand Duke Palace.${prompt}
  12712: I heard from one of the guards that the Tarutaru were seen riding an airship to Bastok, but as for Nag'molada...${prompt}
  12713: |-
    The palace is often the site for grand banquets that are attended by dignitaries from every nation.
    In times like these, we do our utmost to see that the needs of our important visitors are met.${prompt}
  12714: 'Recently, ${choice: 0}[Lord Nag''molada/Lady Esha''ntarl] has been requesting the oddest things from the palace staff.${prompt}'
  12715: These requests appear to be for objects desired by guests of the Duchy.${prompt}
  12716: These requests appear to be for objects desired by guests of our eminent official.${prompt}
  12717: If the requested items could be found in Jeuno, nay, in the markets of any country, we would endeavor to procure them.${prompt}
  12718: |-
    However, many of these objects are not available for purchase.
    I am in quite a quandary, as you can see.${prompt}
  12719: Perhaps if I were to offer a reward, you would be so kind as to locate these items on my behalf?${prompt}
  12720: |-
    Would you be so kind?
    ${selection-lines}
    Certainly.
    I am afraid not.${prompt}
  12721: |-
    The following items have been requested:
    ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.
    My future employment rests in your hands.${prompt}

    My future employment rests in your hands.${prompt}
  12724: Lord Nag'molada often receives guests of all kinds, but I have never before been besieged with such bizarre requests.${prompt}
  12725: This is the first time Lady Esha'ntarl has ever made such a request of the palace staff. Furthermore, I do believe this is the first time she has personally received guests...${prompt}
  12726: While I am curious to know what kind of guests we are entertaining, a good servant does not intrude on the business of his employer.${prompt}
  12727: |-
    Ah, splendid. It appears you have been successful.
    You have my most heartfelt gratitude.${prompt}
  12728: 'Why would the guests of ${choice: 0}[Lord Nag''molada/Lady Esha''ntarl] be so enchanted with these barbaric objects?${prompt}'
  12729: |-
    Oh dear, but I must watch my manners. Please forgive my indiscretion.
    Here is your reward.${prompt}
  12730: |-
    These items were available at the air travel agency?
    Well, one learns something new every day.
    Your reward, as promised.${prompt}
  12731: |-
    To see an array of such objects rekindles my desire to visit the Far East.
    How aromas of the unknown inspire our imagination!
    Here is your reward.${prompt}
  12732: I am sure any child's eyes would light up at a collection of toys such as this.${prompt}
  12733: |-
    I must admit to being quite interested in these myself.
    One never forgets the joy of one's youth.
    Your reward, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/madame].${prompt}
  12734: |-
    Perhaps this is a gift for the lady of the house?
    These items are not of the highest quality...${prompt}
  12735: |-
    But I must not presume to judge the guests of ${choice: 0}[Lord Nag'molada/Lady Esha'ntarl].
    Please accept your reward.${prompt}
  12736: |-
    Your assistance is greatly appreciated.
    I am certain ${choice: 0}[Lord Nag'molada/Lady Esha'ntarl]'s guests will be most satisfied with your efforts.${prompt}
  12737: |-
    ...Emptiness......
    ......Possible weaknesses...
    Hmmm......${prompt}
  12738: Greetings, adventurer. I am Harith, alchemist and member of a certain prestigious society here in Jeuno.${prompt}
  12739: Perchance you have heard of creatures known as the Empty? Currently, other alchemists in the society are working feverishly on methods to manipulate these mysterious beasts.${prompt}
  12740: Would you like me to continue?${prompt}
  12741: |-
    Well...?
    ${selection-lines}
    Please, go on.
    I'm busy at the moment.${prompt}
  12742: |-
    I apologize for taking up your valuable time.
    May fortune smile upon you in your journey.${prompt}
  12743: |-
    The Empty are a cold and hollow species--their very existence a void of nothingness.
    They possess no feeling, no will, no purpose... It is this lack of characteristics that makes them powerful, as they have no known weaknesses.${prompt}
  12744: However, deep within their dark shells we have discovered that something does exist--that “something” being a fragment of a memory lost in the pages of time.${prompt}
  12745: If you happen to have the fortune of coming across one of these incomplete memories on your journeys, bring it to me and I shall purify it into a form known as “anima” using the methods discovered by the society.${prompt}
  12746: By studying the various types of memories left by the Empty, we may be able to discover their strengths and weaknesses.${prompt}
  12747: If you happen to have the fortune of coming across one of these incomplete memories on your journeys, bring it to me and I shall purify it into a form known as “anima” using the methods discovered by the society.${prompt}
  12748: |-
    In addition to these memory fragments, we are also collecting ${item-plural: 0[2]}, ${item-plural: 1[2]}, and ${item-plural: 2[2]} to help us better understand how these creatures evolved.
    Worry not, as you will be duly rewarded for any and all contributions.${prompt}
  12749: |-
    Yes...
    This is definitely the memory of one of the Empty--and in quite excellent condition, I must say.${prompt}
  12750: 'I can synthesize it into a concentrated form of anima; however, I will require a small fee of ${number: 0} gil.${prompt}'
  12751: 'You hand Harith the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and ${number: 1} gil.${prompt}'
  12752: |-
    What a remarkable specimen!

  12905: I am currently studying the phenomenon known as the “Emptiness” and how its byproducts can be better utilized in my field.${prompt}
  12906: My recent research has shown that in addition to the variety of creatures that roam the plains of Promyvion, there are a handful of even stronger manifests that dwell deep within towers that loom above the vast expanses of darkness.${prompt}
  12907: |-
    To continue my work, I require fresh remnants of these rare beasts.

  12948: That was when she began her research into the race of people.${prompt}
  12949: After shifting her focus to the inexplicable appearance of the Kuluu phenomenon, Yve'noile became aware of the darkness that resided within us all.${prompt}
  12950: Her realization led her to betray the king and his son, and adamantly oppose any plan to open the Gates of Paradise.${prompt}
  12951: She had discovered our origins as the children of Promathia...${prompt}
  12952: But all has not been resolved.${prompt}
  12953: The Emptiness still seethes within the mothercrystals.${prompt}
  12954: And the surviving Zilart yet cling desperately to their shadowy plan of returning to Paradise.${prompt}
  12955: I gave up my life in Tavnazia almost thirty years ago to infiltrate the organization of the newly awakened Zilart.${prompt}
  12956: But I have been unable to stem their vast power on my own.${prompt}
  12957: However, we now have a common enemy in the Emptiness. For a time, the people of this age will require the aid of the ancients.${prompt}
  12958: The ancients, too, will need your continuing help.${prompt}
  12959: Surely the Dawn Maiden has bequeathed something of value to her younger kin.${prompt}
  12960: I will find out what this may be, and speak with Archduke Kam'lanaut. He will heed my words.${prompt}
  12961: I shall continue to watch over the world that you and your companions have fought so valiantly to protect.${prompt}
  12962: Now that Nag'molada is gone and the wyrms have ceased their attacks, it is time to remind the Zilart of their true responsibility:${prompt}
  12963: The safety of the mothercrystals and the battle against the Emptiness.${prompt}
  12964: I will continue to monitor their actions as I watch over the world that you and your companions have fought so valiantly to protect.${prompt}

    How could anyone eat fish caught in Bastok's rivers?

    In Port Windurst, people have opened stores on top of boats in the harbor.
    I wonder if they ever change locations...${prompt}

    I was walking around town when a huge nut fell out of a tree and bounced off my head.
    You should be careful!${prompt}
  13254: |-
    Windurst truly is a magical nation.
    I was just teleported from Windurst Woods to Windurst Waters in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  13255: |-
    Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars.
    The property prices must be astronomical.${prompt}
  13256: |-
    Windurst is virtually governed by the Star Sibyl alone, right?
    Don't the ordinary citizens mind being sidelined from politics?${prompt}
  13257: Tarutaru residences are built to accommodate even the tallest Elvaans. But why build shelves so high up...?${prompt}
  13258: |-
    Windurst is famous for its hat shop.
    I can never visit the city without popping in at least once to check the latest styles.${prompt}
  13259: |-
    The hat shop in Windurst Waters has hoods with little ears attached on display.
    Are they not for sale?${prompt}

    The restaurant food in Windurst is prepared by the Culinarians' Guild.

    I'm ashamed to admit it but...I'm hopeless at riding chocobos.
    I have my license, though. Really.${prompt}
  13266: |-
    Hmm.
    I can't think of anything to talk about.${prompt}
  13267: It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.${prompt}
  13268: Because the weather in town is usually either clear or cloudy, there's no need to carry a change of equipment. But since it can be quite unpredictable out in the wilderness, it's good to be prepared.${prompt}
  13269: Just between you and me, I obtained my armor here through unconventional methods.${prompt}

  13275: The other week I went to the Tenshodo to collect a pair of gloves I had ordered, only to discover they were closed for business that day.${prompt}
  13276: |-
    I have to change my shoes as soon as I get home or I can't relax.
    Does anything like that ever happen to you?${prompt}
  13277: |-
    And have you ever worried that the chocobo smell stays with you, even after you dismount?
    Maybe I'm being paranoid...${prompt}
  13278: |-
    ...
    Nope, the only thing that comes to mind is the weather.
    Not very interesting at all.${prompt}

    Do you notice the change?
    I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.${prompt}
  13280: There's nothing I hate more than getting caught outside without the right gear for the weather.${prompt}

    The range of goods is pretty good if you buy through this method.
    Unfortunately though, some items aren't always in stock, so you don't always get what you want.${prompt}

    The guards wouldn't let me inside, if you can believe it!
    My best dress, ruined!${prompt}

    But if you run around too much, your shoes get all soggy.
    And nobody likes soggy shoes now, do they?${prompt}
  13284: I like to be able to see what you're thinking.${prompt}
  13285: I wonder what kind of pet a moogle god would keep...${prompt}
  13286: |-
    Do you notice the change?
    I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.${prompt}
  13287: Of course, that didn't deter me in the least. I simply seized some of the staff and “persuaded” them to open shop.${prompt}
  13288: No one ever seems to want to swing a huge sword while wearing a tunic or a robe...${prompt}
  13289: I'm hopeless at keeping my room tidy, so I bought some furniture to store all my items.${prompt}
  13290: I went to the Blacksmiths' Guild the other day to have some armor repaired, but it turned out to be their day off.${prompt}
  13291: Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?${prompt}
  13292: I've got my eye on some new equipment, but they're way too expensive.${prompt}
  13293: I appreciate your concern for my equipment and all, but what about your own attire?${prompt}
  13294: |-
    Have you ever seen an aurora?
    It looks like a rainbow-colored curtain draped across the sky.${prompt}

    I never know what to wear on windy days.
    I mean, you can't wear a skirt, right?${prompt}
  13296: |-
    I've noticed that beastmen seem to carry gil around.

    The smilebringers really exist, you know!
    They live somewhere far to the north!${prompt}
  13298: Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?${prompt}
  13299: In the Near East, a race of rat-like beastmen called Qiqirn live alongside common folk. Their information network is said to be impressive.${prompt}
  13300: |-
    I always thought it would look mysterious and unique.
    Maybe I just have no fashion sense...${prompt}
  13301: |-
    For some reason, my Mog House began to feel damp after that.
    Guess I bought too many vases...${prompt}
  13302: |-
    Why does that always happen on the very day you decide to go?
    Call me impatient, but I ended up just buying a new set of armor...${prompt}
  13303: You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.${prompt}
  13304: But if I wait a little longer, maybe the price will come down. It's pretty normal for items to become cheaper after a while.${prompt}
  13305: Why, you ask? Is it a crime to want your partner to look cool?${prompt}
  13306: |-
    I've heard they can weave cloth that looks just like it.
    You must be able to make beautiful clothes out of that material...${prompt}
  13307: Not that I ever wear skirts, anyway...${prompt}
  13308: |-
    Do they trade with people?
    I wonder what a beastman would buy...${prompt}
  13309: |-
    They dress in red robes and a red hat, and dance around in white subligaria.
    You believe me, don't you, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13310: You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.${prompt}
  13311: |-
    But that reputation doesn't guarantee their information will always be accurate.
    After all, swindling isn't a race-exclusive occupation.${prompt}
  13312: |-
    You're probably thinking that I have a trunk full of armor.
    I actually trade my old gear in all the time.${prompt}
  13313: I've been meaning to tell you, but you shouldn't send me any deliveries.${prompt}
  13314: |-
    There are powerful enemies emerging all around us these days.
    We should keep up our training to avoid being overwhelmed in battle.${prompt}

  13325: The delivery people seem to have me mixed up with some other adventurer and I'm not getting my mail...${prompt}
  13326: |-
    Of course, I'll be there to fight beside you.
    Why don't we train together?${prompt}
  13327: I suppose we could always talk in a restaurant or a Mog House, but I've become quite attached to our informal meeting spot.${prompt}
  13328: To become strong like that, how many hours a day do you think I should spend leveling?${prompt}
  13329: |-
    M...my Mog House, you ask? Out of the question!
    It's a total mess, with month-old half-eaten scraps...and much worse!${prompt}
  13330: Well, you could at least offer up a topic for conversation occasionally!${prompt}
  13331: |-
    Even though we get so much exercise, I start gaining weight if I eat too much good food.
    Must be a metabolism thing...${prompt}

    I have as many as four different sets worked out...
    I suppose using them in combat will help me to decide.${prompt}

    Verena was once the receptacle for the memories of the Shadow Lord.

  13722: |-
    We have marked the points where the fluctuations were the strongest.
    I would like to entrust the investigation of these areas to you, ${name-player}.${prompt}

    We force the keeper to appear on our terms.
    Then we crush him.${prompt}
  13740: This was Prishe's original plan.${prompt}

    I have faith that Ulmia can perform the piece with little trouble.${prompt}

  13783: The stone she would not relinquish...!
  13784: It has been shattered by your song...!
  13785: Our divine transformation is at hand!
  13786: This ends now!
  13787: Leave Nag'molada to me!
  13788: You shall be the first...!${prompt}
  13789: The first to taste the vengeance of the dead!${prompt}
  13790: I think we're done here.${prompt}
  13791: |-
    Yes, the battle is over.
    There is only...${prompt}
  13792: |-
    She appears to be unharmed.
    There is some trace of Emptiness, but it will cause nothing more than a few bad dreams.${prompt}
  13793: |-
    Thank Altana...
    It was Lion who leaped into the crystal to save us all.${prompt}
  13794: Her struggle with Eald'narche continued within the stone...${prompt}
  13795: Let's get her home to Norg...${prompt}
  13796: |-
    Your red hair...
    Now I know you.${prompt}
  13797: |-
    The nightmare I had...
    You were the one who carried it on for me.${prompt}
  13798: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Make sure you fulfill your promise when she gets better, okay?${prompt}
  13799: The world only grows larger the longer we live. New lives are born, and new lands are discovered. There're always new adventures to be had.${prompt}
  13800: |-
    But you don't gotta rush in, you know?
    This big world of ours will always be waiting.${prompt}
  13801: Waiting for you.${prompt}
  13802: '${color-alt: 15}${name-player}''s badge flashes brightly.${prompt}'
  13803: The Near East must be in a dire condition to send mercenary recruiters all the way to Jeuno...${prompt}
  13804: I heard many tales of the Great War from my dear departed father. They all seemed irrelevant to me until now...${prompt}
  13805: |-
    I see you've got a Salaheem's Sentinel badge there...
    They must be desperate to use those as an attention-grabbing device.${prompt}
  13806: Maybe the empress of Aht Urhgan is short on devoted subjects...${prompt}
  13807: Hm? I see you have one of those brass badges that Salaheem's Sentinels are handing out unauthorized. Let me take a look at it.${prompt}
  13808: |-
    Interesting. Objects from the Near East seem to shine with a different light.
    I've heard that the president of Salaheem's Sentinels is quite tight-fisted, but at least this badge is quite luxurious.${prompt}
  13809: |-
    Near Eastern cuisine is all the rage now.
    Lately I've been studying up on it to add some spice to the palace banquets.${prompt}
  13810: Near Eastern cooking is considered one of the leading cuisines in Vana'diel, so I am sure the archduke will be most pleased.${prompt}
  13811: Lately, the Empire of Aht Urhgan has been building up her army. That's sure to make waves internationally...${prompt}
  13812: Do you think we can continue to preserve friendly relations with all three major nations as the balance of power hangs by a thread?${prompt}
  13813: |-
    You have gathered here today at the request of the Kingdom of San d'Oria.
    I thank you on behalf of the king.${prompt}
  13814: |-
    This is the first time in history that an emergency summit of this nature has taken place.
    The issue I lay before you is beyond the scope of a single nation...${prompt}
  13815: |-
    Prince Pieuje!
    The adventurer you have permitted to attend the summit has arrived.${prompt}
  13816: Thank you for coming, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13817: Allow me to begin by explaining the events that have led to today's meeting.${prompt}
  13818: It began when ${name-player}, mercenary and adventurer, arrived at the gate of the Chateau d'Oraguille bearing a letter of extreme importance.${prompt}
  13819: The contents of that letter prompted me to call the nations together...${prompt}
  13820: It was penned by a sage known as Raillefal, and described in painstaking detail the current state of Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  13821: This is the same nation that has the port in a frenzy over mercenary recruitment...?${prompt}
  13822: |-
    The very same.
    I speak of the Near Eastern nation, the Empire of Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  13823: The Empire!?${prompt}
  13824: Aht Urhgan is now under pressure from three separate beastman armies, and Al Zahbi, the mighty capital itself, is in danger of falling.${prompt}
  13825: Great Altana...${prompt}
  13826: The Silent Empire...${prompt}
  13827: It was once called that.${prompt}
  13828: You may have been too young to know this, Your Highness, but the rest of us should remember.${prompt}
  13829: '...${prompt}'
  13830: I am aware of the term.${prompt}
  13831: In the time of the Great War, the Empire possessed an army greater than the combined forces of the allied nations.${prompt}
  13832: Yet not a single soldier was sent in response to calls for aid...${prompt}
  13833: |-
    My apologies.
    You are well versed in history.${prompt}
  13834: But knowing this, you should also know that we have no obligation to lift even a finger for Aht Urhgan, no matter how serious her predicament.${prompt}
  13835: |-
    Why, Volker, always so calm and cool.
    You've grown hot and bothered, and your speech is most cruel.${prompt}
  13836: You should understand, Doctor Shantotto.${prompt}
  13837: |-
    You were there on that battlefield.
    Who knows how much suffering could've been avoided if we'd had the help of the Empire...${prompt}
  13838: |-
    On the contrary, my dear musketeer.
    We owe them more than you can imagine, I fear.${prompt}
  13839: What do you mean!?${prompt}
  13840: Aht Urhgan has taken many countries under her yoke...${prompt}
  13841: A ferocious nation that has even bared fangs at the Far Eastern folk.${prompt}
  13842: |-
    Calling the Empire to help in our cause,
    would be like freeing us from demons in return for dragon jaws.${prompt}
  13843: That may be true, but even the close relationship Aht Urhgan had with Tavnazia...${prompt}
  13844: That subject is not--${prompt}
  13845: |-
    ...the issue here, I know.
    Doctor Shantotto, why did Windurst open Mhaura's port to the Empire?${prompt}
  13846: My nation's actions are none of your concern.${prompt}
  13847: At least we have a backbone--when will Bastok learn...?${prompt}
  13848: You go too far, Doctor Shantotto...${prompt}
  13849: |-
    Enough!
    I did not call you here to speak of possible troop contributions.${prompt}
  13850: Then why are we here, Your Highness?${prompt}
  13851: Our main concern is the treasure thought to be at the center of this conflict--the Astral Candescence.${prompt}
  13852: “Astral Candescence”?${prompt}
  13853: It is described as some manner of musical instrument, but apparently is much more than that.${prompt}
  13854: This instrument is said to produce a phenomenon known as the “Astral Wind,” a breeze that blows from an unidentifiable source.${prompt}
  13855: It creates a melody in a timbre unheard by mortal ears...${prompt}
  13856: |-
    I'm confused.
    How can there be a melody if nothing can be heard...?${prompt}
  13857: Astral Wind...${prompt}
  13858: Hmph. This is all very unusual, but I'm sure we've all seen stranger things before.${prompt}
  13859: An unidentifiable source...${prompt}
  13860: |-
    In Windurst there is no shortage of magical gadgets.
    Pens that write by themselves. Brooms that sweep on command...${prompt}
  13861: A breeze...${prompt}
  13862: |-
    I mean, they even have that Cardian band.
    That's similar, don't you think, Doctor Shantotto?${prompt}
  13863: Astral...${prompt}
  13864: Wind...${prompt}
  13865: |-
    Doctor Shantotto?
    Is everything alright?${prompt}
  13866: '!!!${prompt}'
  13867: Ohohohoho!${prompt}
  13868: |-
    If it's automatic instruments you need,
    our children make such things before they learn how to read!${prompt}
  13869: The problem lies in the power of the wind.${prompt}
  13870: The wind?${prompt}
  13871: |-
    It envelops those close by, and fills them with a mysterious strength.
    There are few who can resist the lure of this energy.${prompt}
  13872: Even among the beastmen...${prompt}
  13873: If the instrument is that dangerous, why not just give it to the beastmen, or smash it out of hand?${prompt}
  13874: |-
    That is what common sense would tell us.
    If it were up to an individual, or even an entire town...${prompt}
  13875: What are you trying to say?${prompt}
  13876: What if that decision lay in the hands of a nation?${prompt}
  13877: Even if it posed a threat to your own citizens, if that treasure could one day be your salvation, would you not choose to protect it?${prompt}
  13878: How could a mere instrument hold that kind of power...?${prompt}
  13879: The sage who composed this letter is afraid...${prompt}
  13880: Afraid that this Astral Candescence will one day be the catalyst for a conflict to rival the Crystal War.${prompt}
  13881: No!${prompt}
  13882: |-
    Prince Pieuje...
    As a representative for an entire nation, you would do well not to throw those words around so lightly!${prompt}
  13883: |-
    My apologies.
    This is merely based on the conjecture of a sage.${prompt}
  13884: Why don't we have ${name-player}, who has seen and heard these things in person, give us ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] account?${prompt}
  13885: '...${prompt}'
  13886: We cannot make a decision based on this tale alone.${prompt}
  13887: A nation has a responsibility to maintain soldiers and weaponry for the defense of its people.${prompt}
  13888: And for a city in this situation, I would go so far as to say that some sort of secret weapon is almost a necessity.${prompt}
  13889: In any case, it doesn't seem that this Astral Candescence presents any immediate danger to the people of Al Zahbi.${prompt}
  13890: |-
    I wouldn't say that was entirely true,
    if you were me, and I were you.${prompt}
  13891: |-
    ${name-player}.
    I came to a conclusion after you left the chateau.${prompt}
  13892: I wish to hear your honest opinion.${prompt}
  13893: |-
    Give Pieuje your honest opinion?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  13894: |-
    Excellent. I knew asking you here was the right decision.
    I rely upon your vast experience as an adventurer.${prompt}
  13895: Ahaha. Only an adventurer would choose to jest in such company as this.${prompt}
  13896: What is the Astral Candescence?${prompt}
  13897: If it is such an important treasure, then why not secret it away inside the palace instead of placing it in the area most vulnerable to beastman attacks?${prompt}
  13898: I sense some hidden purpose for this dangerous object...${prompt}
  13899: Do you have any thoughts on the matter, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13900: |-
    Any thoughts?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sage Walahra...
    The Gordeus...
    The Walahra Philosophy...
    Not really...${prompt}
  13901: |-
    ${name-player}.
    If you have nothing to contribute, then there is little point in you being here...${prompt}
  13902: |-
    Sage Walahra?
    What manner of person is this?${prompt}
  13903: '...I see.${prompt}'
  13904: The father of the Walahra Philosophy and an alchemist of great renown...${prompt}
  13905: “I, alone, do not possess all the answers. Let us ponder the mysteries of the universe together.”${prompt}
  13906: “Shared knowledge is the shortest path to enlightenment...”${prompt}
  13907: |-
    Hmm.
    Not a philosophy that would appeal to my brother...${prompt}
  13908: Is Prince Trion somehow involved...?${prompt}
  13909: Ah, forgive me. I was merely thinking aloud...${prompt}
  13910: |-
    The “Gordeus.”
    I have heard this name somewhere before...${prompt}
  13911: What manner of person is this?${prompt}
  13912: Not a person? So, it is a holy relic enshrined in Walahra Temple...${prompt}
  13913: In the distant past, Sage Walahra once unraveled the Gordeus and grasped the fundamental principle of existence...${prompt}
  13914: And now a host of like-minded scholars toil day and night to discover the same loose thread to unravel the Gordeus for themselves.${prompt}
  13915: It appears the people of the Empire search for quite different truths than the ones we seek...${prompt}
  13916: |-
    The Walahra Philosophy?
    What manner of learning is this?${prompt}
  13917: What connection does this philosophy have to the Astral Candescence?${prompt}
  13918: “From the void all things are born. To the void all things return.”${prompt}
  13919: I do not understand what this “void” they speak of refers to.${prompt}
  13920: Though this philosophy is not so far from our own belief that all life begins and ends with Great Altana and the mothercrystals...${prompt}
  13921: |-
    Ohohoho!
    Too much time in the cathedral for Destin's little boy!
    The mind is a tool you must sharpen, not a child's toy!${prompt}
  13922: Do you mock me, Doctor Shantotto!?${prompt}
  13923: |-
    You look for your answers in all the wrong places.
    Shall I bring a little hope to your long, dreary faces?${prompt}
  13924: What are you hiding, Shantotto?${prompt}
  13925: The servants of Walahra control the Hall of Binding--the treasure's little nest.${prompt}
  13926: The Hall of Binding is defended by the Serpent Generals--the best of the best!${prompt}
  13927: |-
    The Serpent Generals?
    A name I have heard. Each one is said to be worth a thousand soldiers.${prompt}
  13928: The Astral Candescence is strictly monitored by the Walahra Temple, according to the adventurer's speech...${prompt}
  13929: But the treasure is kept in an area that the beastmen can easily reach.${prompt}
  13930: And there we find the Serpent Generals, the strongest of the strong...${prompt}
  13931: Plus mercenaries like ${name-player} to help them, if I'm not wrong?${prompt}
  13932: Yes, there does seem to be some contradiction to be found here.${prompt}
  13933: You see...${prompt}
  13934: |-
    This is a huge game of “set the trap and wait.”
    And the Astral Candescence is the very tasty bait!${prompt}
  13935: '...!${prompt}'
  13936: |-
    Of course!
    Why didn't I see it?${prompt}
  13937: |-
    But wait.
    This creates a whole new set of questions.
    Why would they want the beastmen in the city?${prompt}
  13938: |-
    There are some things that even I cannot divine.
    It's time to sit back and wait for a sign.${prompt}
  13939: But it does seem that this problem lies at the center of some grand plan.${prompt}
  13940: Without concern for the people of Al Zahbi...${prompt}
  13941: We need more information.${prompt}
  13942: |-
    Yes.
    An individual of keen wits and sharp senses...${prompt}
  13943: My lords, I have a suggestion.${prompt}
  13944: ${name-player} is employed as a mercenary in the Empire.${prompt}
  13945: 'However, ${choice: 0}[she/he] is a distinguished adventurer, who will not sell ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] principles for a bag of gil.${prompt}'
  13946: I point to the safe delivery of the sage's letter as proof of ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] dedication.${prompt}
  13947: A long journey without promise of reward.${prompt}
  13948: And I am sure that all of you present have had numerous beneficial dealings with adventurers.${prompt}
  13949: They have earned our trust and respect!${prompt}
  13950: That is why I put forth the motion that we have ${name-player} return to the Empire and fight as a mercenary.${prompt}
  13951: We cannot allow any more blood to be spilled by beastmen, even should that blood belong to another nation's people.${prompt}
  13952: And if ${name-player} can improve ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] standing enough to bring ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] closer to the Imperial palace...${prompt}
  13953: We may learn the ultimate goal of the Empire.${prompt}
  13954: |-
    You'll find no argument here.
    Adventurers have been the quiet heroes in many of Bastok's darker moments.${prompt}
  13955: |-
    An idea that creates less work for us,
    will not find me making a needless fuss!${prompt}
  13956: How does the Duchy of Jeuno stand on this?${prompt}
  13957: In agreement.${prompt}
  13958: The linking of our auction house services has strengthened the ties between Jeuno and the Empire, but economical matters are superseded by politics...${prompt}
  13959: All in favor...?${prompt}
  13960: |-
    One moment.
    As Raillefal warned, this problem is not likely to remain constrained within the borders of the Near East.${prompt}
  13961: All the lands of Vana'diel, including our four nations...${prompt}
  13962: “Urhguum” is the word for “world” in the language of Aht Urhgan, and this lurking threat could plunge it entirely into chaos.${prompt}
  13963: |-
    We lay this mission before you, ${name-player}.
    Will you consent to take up this burden?${prompt}
  13964: |-
    Take up the burden?
    ${selection-lines}
    That's what I'm here for!
    What am I, a donkey?${prompt}
  13965: You have our thanks, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13966: Naturally, we will do all in our power to aid you in this task.${prompt}
  13967: It is a trifling amount, but perhaps you might use this Aht Urhgan coin on your travels.${prompt}
  13968: An adventurer is free to choose ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] own path...${prompt}
  13969: |-
    However, what I ask of you is for the sake of all Vana'diel.
    I am sure that when the time comes, I can rely on you to perform your duty.${prompt}
  13970: That treasure is more than simple bait...${prompt}
  13971: An astral relic can and will seal your fate.${prompt}
  13972: |-
    The Empress goes too far in her game.

  14023: If I'm not mistaken, Your Highness, wasn't it one of your agents that described the Empress's position as little more than a puppet on the throne?${prompt}
  14024: I...${prompt}
  14025: This will be a conflict of epic proportions. Perhaps we should strive harder for a diplomatic solution...${prompt}
  14026: While I agree with you in theory, we walk a dangerous line.${prompt}
  14027: Despite its state of constant warfare, the sprawling Empire commands staggering resources. If we fail to make the first move, we could face casualties on the scale of the Great War.${prompt}
  14028: |-
    The Great War? Surely you jest?
    The carnage from this apocalypse will be far greater than all the rest.${prompt}
  14029: Worse than the Great War?${prompt}
  14030: |-
    You all know of the Gordeus, I presume?
    It is best we're all aware of this potential source of doom.${prompt}
  14031: One does not lightly forget such an object...${prompt}
  14032: You speak of the sacred artifact kept within the Walahra Temple?${prompt}
  14033: An amazing creation worthy of mention.${prompt}
  14034: But that is not the phenomenon to which I wish to draw your attention.${prompt}
  14035: I refer to an event from nine hundred years before...${prompt}
  14036: The supernova that was born from the earth and stole the night sky for an entire year, as was passed down in lore.${prompt}
  14037: |-
    Ah, now this I recall from my lessons!
    This was the miracle bestowed by the Goddess that marked the beginning of the Crystal Era.${prompt}
  14038: After the glare finally faded, this star of the first magnitude became part of the Alexander constellation, correct?${prompt}
  14039: |-
    It was merely a coincidence that the supernova's trajectory passed in front of that star.
    The truth of the matter is more fascinating by far.${prompt}
  14040: The trajectory? I don't understand.${prompt}
  14041: I discovered an ancient papyrus in the extensive vaults of the Optistery.${prompt}
  14042: The following was written in a script bold and flowery:${prompt}
  14043: “When the light deity clashed with the dark, rent in twain were the heavens, and devastated was the earth by a storm beyond comprehension.”${prompt}
  14044: |-
    I must admit to feeling a degree of shock,
    for this simple passage described the arrival of Ragnarok...${prompt}
  14045: |-
    Ragnarok...
    The northern legend that tells of the twilight of the gods?
    You mean to tell us that this supernova was in fact the aftermath of a battle between divinities?${prompt}
  14046: |-
    Oh, so close to the mark.
    Shall I endeavor to bring you out of the dark?${prompt}
  14047: This is my hypothesis based on the facts at hand...${prompt}
  14048: The old Empire of Aht Urhgan launched their iron colossus, imbued with the spirit of the light deity, high into the air, and attempted to dominate the entire land.${prompt}
  14049: |-
    The nation that revered a rival deity was unsurprisingly not amused.
    They sent up their Dark Rider born from sacrifice and with utter darkness infused.${prompt}
  14050: A fierce battle raged in the skies, and eventually both combatants fell to earth--the giant in pieces, and the rider with grave wounds to his material form.${prompt}
  14051: But this titanic struggle had blasted the land into ruin, and left a void in the heavens that spawned a cataclysmic storm...${prompt}
  14052: An apocalypse...${prompt}
  14053: |-
    What a ridiculous story.
    How could an iron colossus be made to fly?${prompt}
  14054: And what does this have to do with the name of the Gordeus?${prompt}
  14055: |-
    We Tarutaru have always been notoriously fussy about our cuisine.
    The name was probably heard from a trader in foreign goods, is what I mean.${prompt}
  14056: The name of the colossus's heart, given to a star...${prompt}
  14057: We have let ourselves be distracted by the candescences. The Gordeus should have been our true concern.${prompt}
  14058: |-
    We can only hope that the Grand Vizier has failed to notice the true value of the treasure under his nose.
    We must hurry to bring this matter to a close.${prompt}
  14059: |-
    Naji reporting in!
    I've brought ${name-player} back with me!${prompt}
  14060: You're late. Where in Altana's name have you been!?${prompt}
  14061: Take it easy, Ayame.${prompt}
  14062: |-
    ${name-player}, we are grateful you could come.
    Your insight will be invaluable.${prompt}
  14063: Please, describe to us your impressions of the events unfolding in the Empire...${prompt}
  14064: Thanks to your talents, gaining the program data we needed was far less complicated than expected.${prompt}
  14065: But the Empress appears to have only a tentative hold on consciousness...${prompt}
  14066: It is nothing to be concerned about. When reading someone's memories with my altered...perspective...it occasionally releases images and thoughts sealed deep within the mind.${prompt}
  14067: |-
    This state of regression is only temporary.
    She will recover in time...${prompt}
  14068: Let us begin.${prompt}
  14069: So...this day has finally come.${prompt}
  14070: That voice!${prompt}
  14071: If it isn't Nashmeira, then who...?${prompt}
  14072: I know not who you are, but it appears you have completed construction of Alzadaal and unraveled the Gordeus.${prompt}
  14073: |-
    Congratulations are in order!
    You will soon hold the most awe-inspiring weapon in Urhguum in the palm of your hand--the power of light.${prompt}
  14074: Father...!?${prompt}
  14075: But the power of Alexander is a double-edged sword.${prompt}
  14076: Mother!${prompt}
  14077: |-
    The infinite energy of a star...
    The legends--not to mention the ruins--speak eloquently of the destruction that will befall should you make a single misstep.${prompt}
  14078: |-
    It is not too late.
    If you possess a shred of compassion, you will halt the program immediately.
    We hope you choose the wiser course...${prompt}
  14079: |-
    Hmph...a cunning trick, Nashmeira.
    Defiant until the last.${prompt}
  14080: '...${prompt}'
  14081: '!!!'
  14082: |-
    Behold!
    This is the will of Alexander!${prompt}
  14083: |-
    I fear no legend or signs of past failures.
    I will carve out my own destiny.${prompt}
  14084: '...?${prompt}'
  14085: O-Ovjang...?${prompt}
  14086: Mnejing!?${prompt}
  14087: No...
  14088: Noooooo...!!!
  14089: '...${prompt}'
  14090: |-
    Thank you, ${name-player}.
    I am sure we all felt the immediacy of your experiences.${prompt}
  14091: And if we can believe the words of the Grand Vizier, a war with the Empire seems inevitable.${prompt}
  14092: I'm afraid I have to agree with you...${prompt}
  14093: |-
    Then, a war it shall be.
    Preparations must be made with all urgency.${prompt}
  14094: |-
    Bastok's armada is ready to sail.
    Once I give the order, the seas will be ours.${prompt}
  14095: Are we committed?${prompt}
  14096: |-
    Ohohoho.
    Our amphibious cardian advance units were already given the order to deploy.
    They lay hidden in the Wajaom Woodlands, primed and waiting to destroy.${prompt}
  14097: |-
    Already deployed...?
    Was the decision of this council a forgone conclusion?${prompt}
  14098: '...${prompt}'
  14099: N-now hold on a minute!${prompt}
  14100: '!!!${prompt}'
  14101: From what I could gather from ${name-player}'s explanation, this Luzaf character wants to prevent Ragnarok as much as we do.${prompt}
  14102: Naji! Remember your station!${prompt}
  14103: And the Empress is of the same mind...isn't that right, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  14104: The way I see it, there's no need to go head-to-head with the Empire's forces.${prompt}
  14105: If we can spirit Luzaf out of their clutches, then we can at least put a stop to this Ragnarok business.${prompt}
  14106: We might even get a chance to restore authority to the Empress while we're at it.${prompt}
  14107: Ayame, ${name-player}...we've all been to Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  14108: We've seen the lives, the smiles, the tears of her people...${prompt}
  14109: |-
    The citizens of the Empire are as much the children of Altana as we are.
    War should be considered only after every other avenue has been exhausted.${prompt}
  14110: Naji...${prompt}
  14111: |-
    Ohohohohoho.
    A voice of reason from Bastok, the nation of mines and gloom?${prompt}
  14112: And you would plan this strategy yourself, I assume?${prompt}
  14113: |-
    What? Um, y-yes!
    Of course!${prompt}
  14114: |-
    Wonderful. I admire your ambition.
    I shall offer the latest model of cardian to escort you on this mission.${prompt}
  14115: Thank you, Doctor Shantotto!${prompt}
  14116: |-
    Very well.
    Then you shall have two veteran knights to accompany you as well.${prompt}
  14117: And from Jeuno, you will have the use of our fastest airship, with an ace pilot at the wheel.${prompt}
  14118: Prince Trion, Sir Wolfgang...${prompt}
  14119: |-
    It appears I have no choice.
    I will inform the president of this operation myself.${prompt}
  14120: Captain Volker! Then I should--${prompt}
  14121: On one condition!${prompt}
  14122: |-
    ${name-player} is to go with you.
    Will you accompany Naji?${prompt}
  14123: |-
    Join the mission to rescue Luzaf?
    ${selection-lines}
    Count me in!
    I just left the Empire...${prompt}
  14124: It will be dangerous, but please lend Naji your experience and expertise.${prompt}
  14125: It will be dangerous, but I will feel better knowing Naji is accompanied by someone I know I can trust.${prompt}
  14126: Looking forward to working with you, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  14127: Excellent. I will have Pherimociel prepare your transportation at once.${prompt}
  14128: |-
    I understand.
    Not many would be willing to throw themselves back into the dragon's lair so soon after escaping it.${prompt}
  14129: |-
    I see...
    I understand it will be dangerous, but I believe you would be up to the task, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  14130: Well, then, I guess I'll have to make do without ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]...${prompt}
  14131: |-
    No, Naji.
    Without ${name-player}, I will not allow this reckless plan to go ahead.${prompt}
  14132: In any case, Captain Volker, I will have Pherimociel prepare an airship for departure.${prompt}
  14133: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Speak to Pherimociel should you change your mind.
    You can find him in the Ducal Guard Post.${prompt}
  14134: |-
    I'm sure we all have urgent tasks to attend to.
    I declare this session of the council at an end.${prompt}
  14135: May our actions find Altana's fortune!${prompt}
  14136: |-
    Ready to leave?
    ${selection-lines}
    Ready.
    Not yet.${prompt}
  14137: |-
    What is it?
    Do I look like a tour guide?${prompt}
  14138: '!!!${prompt}'
  14139: |-
    Ah! My apologies!
    You're here for the Wajaom Infiltration Operation, correct?${prompt}
  14140: The airship Endymion is all fueled up and going through a final flight check.${prompt}
  14141: Are you ready for deployment, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  14142: |-
    Are you ready?
    ${selection-lines}
    Ready.
    Not yet.${prompt}
  14143: |-
    Understood.
    I have orders from Sir Wolfgang to hold the Endymion at port until you are aboard.${prompt}
  14144: Please inform me when your preparations are complete.${prompt}
  14145: |-
    Very well.
    Please continue into the courtyard.${prompt}
  14146: |-
    The other members of your team are assembled and waiting.

    Enough of this prattling.

    Do I have your attention, ${name-player}?
    I'll go over the mission again for your sake--I have the details memorized, of course.${prompt}
  14166: The Endymion will touch down in the waters of the Sicklemoon Straits, and we'll travel north under the cover of darkness. Once we reach the coast of the Wajaom Woodlands, our ground team will disembark.${prompt}
  14167: We then don our mercenary disguises and slip into Al Zahbi unnoticed and rendezvous with Rohin...Robin...${prompt}

    No tricks!

  14180: The airship Endymion is being prepared for flight.${prompt}

  14182: |-
    I find it hard to believe that anyone could knock the Endymion out of the sky so easily.
    There must be some mistake...${prompt}
  14183: |-
    The entire port is rushing to prepare the allied airship fleet to avenge the crew of the Endymion.
    We'll make those Imperial curs pay!${prompt}
  14184: |-
    The alliance fleet has returned to Jeuno without firing a single shot in the name of the Endymion.

    Lend a hand?
    ${selection-lines}
    Certainly.
    Sorry...${prompt}
  14210: |-
    Great!
    Your partner was equally enthusiastic about this. Please allow me to explain the details.${prompt}

    Is that so...
    That's a shame, because your partner was rather enthusiastic about this. Won't you spare just a moment to listen to my proposal?${prompt}
  14212: You see, what I have envisioned is not an elongated epic tale of incredible feats. Rather, I would like to focus on telling a simple story about the everyday lives of two individuals who were predestined to meet.${prompt}
  14213: So basically, to help me with my project, all I ask is for you to report to me the details of your daily activities together, no matter how insignificant they may be.${prompt}
  14214: It may seem trivial, but this is the kind of information that allows writers to most faithfully and accurately portray their subject.${prompt}
  14215: For instance, you could tell me about a trip you two embarked on to, say, Qufim Island, or how you thought that teamwork in battle was especially good on a particular day. Anything at all.${prompt}
  14216: Whenever you've spent time with your partner, I would like you to come and report your undertakings to me, regardless of how unimportant the events seem to you.${prompt}
  14217: Oh, please forgive me. I've left out a most important detail.${prompt}
  14218: You're interested in knowing about compensation, am I correct?${prompt}

  14220: When this has been achieved, I intend to reward you fittingly.${prompt}
  14221: I realize that this is something that is yet to happen. I'm also fully aware of the fact that, until then, I am little more than the impoverished writer who stands before you.${prompt}

  14293: |-
    What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo!
    Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!${prompt}
  14294: |-
    We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers.

    Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo.
    Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom.
    It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!${prompt}
  14297: The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!${prompt}
  14298: |-
    In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign.
    Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.${prompt}
  14299: Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...${prompt}
  14300: |-
    King Kupofried was greatly dismayed.
    How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?${prompt}
  14301: In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.${prompt}
  14302: “Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo,” he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.${prompt}
  14303: |-
    Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin.
    A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?${prompt}
  14304: |-
    We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition.
    We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!${prompt}

    ${name-player}.
    What brings you to the Duchy wearing such a grave expression?${prompt}
  14361: '...I see.${prompt}'
  14362: |-
    Needless to say, it is beyond my station to render a decision on affairs of state.
    Wait here. I will consult with my superiors.${prompt}
  14363: It is as I expected. The Duchy will hold formal deliberations as to the potential repercussions of our involvement in this matter.${prompt}
  14364: |-
    Chin up, ${name-player}. The earnestness of the Empire's plea has not been lost on our diplomats.
    Perhaps the “Silent Empire” truly intends to change its ways...${prompt}
  14365: I can offer no promises, but encourage you to do what you can in the meantime.${prompt}
  14366: |-
    You make for the three nations from here, do you not?
    Then be on your way, and have faith that good tidings will await you upon your return.${prompt}
  14367: |-
    Have you received consent from the three nations?
    Not yet, you say? Then I suggest you get moving.${prompt}
  14368: |-
    The seals of the three nations...yes, everything seems to be in order.
    Good work.${prompt}
  14369: |-
    You'll be pleased to know that the Duchy has also agreed to give its consent.
    Here are the relevant papers.${prompt}
  14370: |-
    I trust you'll see that this matter ends well for all of us, ${name-player}.
    Now you'd best be on your way.${prompt}
  14371: You there. Yes, you, adventurer! Your downcast countenance tells me your life wants for exhilaration.${prompt}
  14372: 'Who am I, you ask? Let''s just say I''m he who is about to banish all trace of tedium from your life with an irresistible offer--one of otherworldly proportions, to be sure. For a mere ${number: 1} gil, this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} I hold is yours.${prompt}'
  14373: |-
    “But what in Slumbering Samwell's shank does it do,” you ask?
    Consider yourself fortunate, for it's my policy to demystify before the customer buys.${prompt}
  14374: |-
    What will you do?
    ${selection-lines}
    Let him ramble.
    Purchase ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.
    Learn how to use it.
    Discard abyssite.
    Leave.${prompt}
  14375: Ahem! Allow me to present you with a supposition.${prompt}
  14376: Lying in parallel to the world upon which we stand exists another dimension.${prompt}
  14377: |-
    “Abyssea” is its name--or at least, the name I've bestowed upon it.
    It is a world of boundless beauty, mystique, and riches unclaimed.${prompt}
  14378: |-
    Now, suppose this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} I hold is a key to accessing Abyssea.
    Were you in possession of one, your curiosity would get the better of you, yes?${prompt}
  14379: Strictly speaking, this object does not grant entry into Abyssea itself.${prompt}
  14380: It does, however, make it possible to interact with beings from that plane of existence--“Abysseans,” I call them.${prompt}
  14381: |-
    The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} serves to detect Abysseans that wander the gulf between worlds.
    How those hapless creatures--I refer to them as “Voidwalkers”--found their way there, mind you, is another subject entirely.${prompt}
  14382: 'Having drifted to this realm from the world yonder, much like the Voidwalkers themselves, ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} are attuned to the presence of these creatures and will react--vibrate and emit light--when they draw near.${prompt}'
  14383: The closer your distance to a Voidwalker, the stronger the reaction becomes, until the creature is forcibly wrested into this dimension.${prompt}
  14384: 'Repeated contact with Abysseans will cause the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to take on different hues, allowing it to respond to creatures belonging to the higher echelons of Voidwalkers.${prompt}'
  14385: |-
    Be forewarned! Abysseans are among the most foul-tempered, unpredictable creatures.
    You would do well to steel yourself for a trying encounter prior to making contact.${prompt}
  14386: I trust your many adventures have made you familiar with those ghastly statues scattered across the land called cavernous maws.${prompt}
  14387: My observations have revealed that the concentration of Voidwalkers is greatest in locations where these statues are found.${prompt}
  14388: As yet, I have no plausible explanations for this phenomenon, but you needn't concern yourself with such details.${prompt}
  14389: Yours, my friend, is a dilemma infinitely simpler in nature.${prompt}
  14390: All this far-fetched talk of Abyssea, Abysseans, and Voidwalkers...${prompt}
  14391: I'm fully aware of the fantastical nature of my tale, and do not think poorly of those inclined to skepticism.${prompt}
  14392: |-
    Yet I feel no need to vouch further for the authenticity of my claims.
    Such is my confidence that the truth speaks for itself.${prompt}
  14393: |-
    Now then. A great new world has presented itself before you.
    The question is, will you embrace this opportunity, or let it pass you by?${prompt}
  14394: |-
    As Abysseans cross from one realm to another, so too does gil pass from one individual to the next.
    In my mind, it is only fitting that gil is that which grants you the key to Abyssea.${prompt}
  14395: |-
    My tales have piqued your interest, have they?
    As I have mentioned prior, the price is ${number: 0} gil.${prompt}
  14396: |-
    Hand over ${number: 0} gil?
    ${selection-lines}
    Aye.
    Nay.${prompt}
  14397: |-
    No? The sum I ask is by no means prohibitive.
    I'll be waiting here, should you ever change your mind.${prompt}
  14398: |-
    I thank you for your custom.
    Here is your very own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}
  14399: 'As a service for all customers, upon request I will take your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} off your hands and dispose of it in your stead.${prompt}'
  14400: |-
    The ability to meddle with inter-dimensional matter can be considered a great power, with which comes great responsibility.
    Indeed there have been those who found the burden beyond their capacity to cope.${prompt}
  14401: It seems you are short on gil. Yet I cannot grant concessions, lest access to otherworldly realms lose its true value.${prompt}
  14402: 'I see you''ve developed a taste for ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}. Yet I fear I cannot furnish you further, for one alone is sufficient to invite misfortune upon the heedless.${prompt}'
  14403: |-
    You wish to know how to use the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?
    There is no trick to it. Allow me to demonstrate.${prompt}
  14404: |-
    While in possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, simply assume a resting pose.
    I'm given to understand it is second nature to all adventurers.${prompt}
  14405: 'Doing so will cause your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to react. Pertinent information can be gleaned by observing the magnitude of its vibration and the manner of light emitted.${prompt}'
  14406: Should neither reaction occur, take it to mean that no Voidwalkers roam the area.${prompt}
  14407: Should it vibrate softly but emit no light, take it to mean that Voidwalkers have recently passed through and may soon return.${prompt}
  14408: Should it vibrate softly and emit a gentle light, take it to mean that Voidwalkers presently roam the area.${prompt}
  14409: |-
    Now, pay particular attention to what I'm about to explain.
    The reaction of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will change once a predetermined distance from a Voidwalker has been closed.${prompt}
  14410: |-
    From that point onwards, the magnitude of the vibration corresponds directly to the creature's strength.
    Based on this knowledge, it is your decision whether to pursue it further.${prompt}
  14411: The gentle glow of light, on the other hand, will intensify to become a radiant beam pointing in the direction of the creature.${prompt}
  14412: Following that beam to its end will cause the heretofore invisible Voidwalker to cross fully over into this world and take form.${prompt}
  14413: This precise moment of encounter with an Abyssean, I have dubbed “contact.”${prompt}
  14414: Not only are Abysseans known to be temperamental and unpredictable; there are those that demonstrate a degree of cunning and guile far beyond that seen in this world.${prompt}
  14415: Consider yourself warned.${prompt}
  14416: 'For as surely as the beam of light emitted by the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} guides you to a Voidwalker, so too does it guide the Voidwalker to you. Be ever mindful of this fact.${prompt}'
  14417: Know also that not one, but numerous Voidwalkers may roam the land at any given time, and the readings indicate only the creature nearest you.${prompt}
  14418: You would do well to check the readings regularly, as a sudden change in the light's direction could mean a different Voidwalker has wandered your way.${prompt}
  14419: Voidwalkers will only reveal their true form at the point of contact, and seeking one only to be met with another is a scenario all adventurers want to avoid.${prompt}
  14420: |-
    But surely, you grow weary of my ramblings.
    I for one believe this is something best learned through doing.${prompt}
  14421: |-
    Has the burden of this responsibility proven too heavy to bear?
    Very well, I will take it off your hands and see to its disposal.${prompt}

    Kupo-ho! Another adventurer has found ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] way to my domain.
    Was it my aura of superior sagacity that led you here? This conspicuous crate and chest that sit seductively at my side?${prompt}

    Many secrets have I to tell, but sadly, they would be beyond your meager mental faculties to fathom.

    It is no matter.
    What matters is that you are here, and from the look of it, you are a suitable subject for the task I would entrust to you.${prompt}
  14431: I speak to you on behalf of the Magian Mooglehood, an ancient and august assembly of wisemoogles hailing from the once-glorious Kingdom of Kupalika.${prompt}
  14432: |-
    Our predecessors were councilors and confidants to none other than the celebrated King Kupofried himself.
    To this day, it is our mission to safeguard the secrets of their moogle magic and see them properly passed down to posterity.${prompt}
  14433: |-
    Each illustrious member of the Magian Mooglehood guards knowledge of a distinct branch of our lineal lore.
    My specialty lies in weaponry; with my aid, you will be doling out damage and destruction in ways heretofore unimagined!${prompt}
  14434: “What impelled you to impart this long-withheld wisdom to us? And why now, kupo?” the unenlightened adventurer might ask.${prompt}
  14435: 'To which the wise moogle would readily reply: The answer, my friend, is in the mog tablets--those remarkable relics wrought by King Kupofried himself--that were only recently recovered by resourceful adventurers such as rrr...yourself.${prompt}'
  14436: |-
    There is an ancient (and somewhat alarming) prophecy in our mooglehood.
    It goes...<ahem>...“King Kupofried's creations shall slumber soundly until such time as their Super Kupowers are called upon to save the realm from utter ruin, kupo.”${prompt}
  14437: The particulars of the prophecy--preposterous as this may seem--outstrip even our prodigious powers of perception.${prompt}
  14438: 'Yet this I know, kupo: if moogle magic is what shall deliver this world from destruction, then moogle magic this world shall have--in abundance!${prompt}'
  14439: |-
    As an adventurer of renown, repute, and paramount prowess, you would seem a worthy beneficiary for our boon.
    And yet the Magian Mooglehood is nothing if not meticulously methodical. No, we must be certain...${prompt}
  14440: |-
    I propose to task you with a series of trials.
    Each time you emerge victorious, we shall proffer you a portion of our powers, kupo.${prompt}
  14441: |-
    What say you, adventurer?
    Will you undertake the Trial of the Magians, that you might one day wield the mightiest of moogle magic to save your realm from destruction and devastation?${prompt}

    Kupo...oh?
    It would seem I have no trials pertaining to that particular piece of weaponry.

    Well, that's a shame. And I had such high hopes for you, kupo.
    Oh well, I'll just have to wipe your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} clean.${prompt}
  14655: 'You have abandoned Trial ${number: 0}.${prompt}'
  14656: Kupo-oh? I was going to erase the trial insignia from your item, but I don't see it anywhere.${prompt}
  14657: |-
    You can't start a new trial until you clear the mark from the old one. Sorry, but rules are rules, kupo.
    So when you find the item, just trade it to me, okay?${prompt}
  14658: You do not currently have that trial in progress.${prompt}
  14659: Kupo-oh? This item is still marked for a trial you've abandoned.${prompt}

    Want me to erase it so you can make a fresh start?
    I would highly recommend that you do, kupo.${prompt}

    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, remove it.
    No, leave it.${prompt}
  14662: |-
    What am I supposed to be doing again?
    Please forgive me. I'm still new around here, kupo.${prompt}
  14663: 'The trial insignia has vanished from your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.'
  14664: |-
    Kupo? I've never heard of that trial.
    Are my elders telling you secrets that they're not telling me, kupo?${prompt}
  14665: |-
    Ask something?
    ${selection-lines}
    About this training...
    Undertaking a trial.
    Completing a trial.
    Return.${prompt}
  14666: |-
    Ooh, ooh! Do I get to explain about trials? I've studied so, uh...studiously...for this day, kupo!
    <Ahem>... The Magian Mooglehood is an ancient and august assembly of, er, moogles...who, uh, do super-secret special things, and...and...${prompt}
  14667: So, yeah! You can talk to Elder Orange when you've reached a certain level of experience, and he'll send you on all sorts of sadistic--er, challenging--trials. Complete them, and you can receive all kinds of nifty items and stuff.${prompt}
  14668: But what's even more exciting is the set of stupendously stylish job-specific poses that I can teach you, kupo!${prompt}
  14669: |-
    Learn one, and you'll be able to use it even if you engage in a temporary career change.
    Why, it's the perfect way to share your profound passion for your chosen profession with the world!${prompt}
  14670: |-
    So here's the deal. In order to learn a gesture from me, you'll first need to achieve a certain level of proficiency in your chosen job.
    In the perplexing parlance of the Magian Mooglehood, we call that “level 30.”${prompt}
  14671: |-
    Choose one of the trials, and I'll give you a piece of equipment, kupo.
    You don't need to wear it, but keep it close by until you complete your task.${prompt}
  14672: |-
    If you ever want to take a peek at your progress, just come back to me.
    ...Or if you change your mind and decide to quit. But that's no fun, kupo!${prompt}
  14673: Any items requested of you in your trials can be tossed into that handy-dandy delivery crate sitting beside Elder Orange, kupo.${prompt}
  14674: |-
    Once you've completed your objective, return here and trade back to me the piece of equipment I gave you at the start of your trial.
    Just like that, your work is done! Huzzah!${prompt}
  14675: |-
    So make especially sure that you don't lose the equipment, of course.
    If you do, how will I know your deed is done, kupo?${prompt}
  14676: |-
    I truly can't emphasize it enough: take extra-special care of the item I give you until your trial is through!
    Are we clear, kupo?${prompt}
  14677: |-
    Complete one of my trials, and I'll teach you the corresponding gesture.
    My elders say that this knowledge will be imprinted in your memory as a “key item,” a term that is completely inscrutable to an initiate like me, kupo.${prompt}
  14678: |-
    They also say that to strike the pose, you need only chant the ancient moogle incantation “/jobemote (job name)”.
    Why, my tongue got all tied just trying to pronounce that, kupo!${prompt}
  14679: |-
    A trial for ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?
    Well, let's just see here, kupo...${prompt}

    Take on Trial ${number: 0}?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure!
    Nah.${prompt}
  14682: Wonderful! Let me just moogle-magic that up for you, kupo!${prompt}
  14683: 'Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is now recording the progress of your trial!${prompt}'
  14684: |-
    Oh, and that's right!
    I need to engrave up your equipment as well, don't I?${prompt}
  14685: 'A trial insignia has been inscribed upon your ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  14686: 'Note: While your item is inscribed with this insignia, you may not undertake any other trials with the same item.${prompt}'
  14687: |-
    It looks like you're already working on that trial, kupo.
    It's okay. I'm still getting the hang of this, too!${prompt}
  14688: |-
    Oh, I'm so terribly sorry! I don't think I can assign that trial to you yet.
    I'd tell you why, but the elders won't even let me know, kupo!${prompt}
  14689: |-
    Wow! That's a full ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} if I've ever seen one, kupo.
    Sorry, but the rules say you can only undertake a maximum of ten trials at once.${prompt}
  14690: |-
    You'll have to complete or abandon one of your current trials before starting a new one.
    Someday, when I'm in charge of the mooglehood, I'll change this silly rule! Might be a while, though, kupo...${prompt}
  14691: |-
    Kupo-oh-oh.
    I'm afraid there aren't any trials for that item.
  14692: "Hmm. I've never heard of any trials for that item. \nMaybe the elders just didn't tell me about them, kupo?"
  14693: |-
    You're already working on a trial for that ${item-singular: 0[2]}, kupo.
    Trial ${number: 1}, to be exact.${prompt}
  14694: |-
    Well, look who's managed to complete their trial!
    That ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is just boiling to the brim with moogle magic!${prompt}
  14695: I certainly hope I remember the incantation the elders taught me.${prompt}
  14696: Kupolius...augmentus!${prompt}
  14697: 'There is a sudden flash of light as potent moogle magic surges through the ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  14698: 'A burst of energy shoots from the ${item-singular: 0[2]} into your body, and you suddenly feel more stylish than before!'
  14699: '${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]} is imprinted into your memory!'
  14700: |-
    Well, this was perfect practice for both of us, wouldn't you say?

    This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is the lifeblood of the martello, and the source of its curative powers.

    Feast your eyes on this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. She's a beauty, isn't she?
    Installing one of these into a martello will increase its fuel capacity.${prompt}
  14887: |-
    An upgraded martello will be able to sustain its energy stores for a longer time between replenishment operations.
    Needless to say, this is a blessing and a half to those on the battlefield.${prompt}

    We are fortunate indeed to have you on our side.${prompt}
  14974: No doubt you're wondering why I've summoned you here today.${prompt}
  14975: |-
    Time is of the essence, so I'll get straight to the heart of the matter.
    We are engaged in an operation of the utmost importance, and I thought you'd be just the ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] for the task.${prompt}
  14976: |-
    As you may have already noticed, the Voidwalker threat grows more menacing by the day.
    In particular, the fiends we have encountered here in the vicinity of the Duchy are possessed of powers that dwarf their already-formidable brethren.${prompt}
  14977: |-
    I hereby authorize you for participation in Voidwatch operations in the Jeuno region.
    Serve us well, and you will be duly compensated for your efforts.${prompt}
  14978: |-
    You are not the only ${choice: 0}[adventurer/Allied soldier] I have recruited for this operation.
    Should you chance upon any others, you may join up with them if you so choose.
    The Duchy--no, the entire realm--is counting on you, ${name-player}. Do not let us down.${prompt}
  14979: |-
    So you have finally come.
    I am Mawl'gofaur, aide to the Archduke and overseer of the Voidwatch operation in His Excellency's absence.${prompt}
  14980: |-
    I hear you have proven yourself capable on the field.
    The Grand Duchy has need of your services.${prompt}
  14981: |-
    The Voidwalker threat grows ever more grave by the day.
    The fiends that have been sighted in the immediate vicinity of Jeuno, in particular, possess powers unlike anything we've seen before.${prompt}
  14982: |-
    Were the Duchy to fall to this extradimensional menace, it would spell disaster for the realm.
    This should be evident to even a grunt such as yourself.${prompt}
  14983: In the name of His Excellency Kam'lanaut, Archduke of Jeuno, I hereby authorize you for participation in all Voidwatch operations conducted under the Duchy's jurisdiction.${prompt}
  14984: |-
    Mind you, you are not the only one to whom I have bestowed this clearance.
    Should you chance upon any of the others, you may band together against the fiends.
    Or do not. It matters little to me so long as you succeed in your efforts.${prompt}
  14985: |-
    We lack for capable soldiers, so do try to stay alive.
    Now be off with you. More pressing matters require my attention.${prompt}
  14986: |-
    The assignment of individual objectives will be handled by our officers stationed throughout the greater Jeuno region.
    Report to one posthaste to receive your orders.${prompt}
  14987: Do not forget to report back to an officer upon completing an objective, lest your accomplishments go overlooked.${prompt}
  14988: |-
    ...That is all.
    You are dismissed.${prompt}
  14989: I remind you again...${prompt}
  14990: |-
    Ah, you've returned!
    Your exploits in the Jeuno operation have been remarkable to observe.
    On behalf of the entire Grand Duchy, I commend you.${prompt}
  14991: |-
    ...Very well. The next step is clear.
    I hereby authorize you to participate in our Qufim operation.${prompt}
  14992: |-
    Again, I must warn you.
    The enemy you face in Qufim will be unlike anything you've faced thus far.${prompt}
  14993: |-
    The Voidwalker menace grows more dire with each passing hour.
    Where do these beasts come from, and what brings them to our world?
    Sometimes it seems as if the tireless efforts of our researchers yield more questions than answers.${prompt}
  14994: |-
    And yet we can do nothing but continue the fight.
    I'm counting on you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  14995: |-
    On behalf of the Grand Duchy, I commend your efforts in the Jeuno Voidwatch operation.
    Yet the battle is far from won.${prompt}
  14996: |-
    I hereby issue you your next assignment.
    You are to travel to the Qufim region and assist in our operation there.${prompt}
  14997: |-
    The Voidwalker menace is at its most fierce in Qufim.
    We have already lost our share of capable men.${prompt}
  14998: |-
    Do your best not to join them.
    Now be along on your way.${prompt}
  14999: |-
    ${name-player}! I've received word of your accomplishments in Qufim.
    Truly, your service to the Voidwatch has exceeded even my initial expectations.${prompt}
  15000: |-
    ${name-player}! I've received word of your accomplishments.
    Truly, your service to the Voidwatch has exceeded even my initial expectations.${prompt}
  15001: |-
    And yet it is hardly the time to rejoice.
    You have seen it with your own eyes--no sooner is one fiend slain than another of its brethren emerges to take its place.${prompt}
  15002: |-
    We must find a way to seal the planar rifts.
    Then, and only then, will we be able to quash this extradimensional menace once and for all.${prompt}
  15003: |-
    Even as we speak, an elite team of my best researchers works tirelessly to that very end.
    Sadly, the true nature of the rifts remains very much an enigma...${prompt}
  15004: |-
    And so I have no choice but to employ capable adventurers such as yourself to keep the fiends at bay.
    As inefficient as it may seem, it is the best course of action available to us under these conditions.${prompt}
  15005: |-
    We are counting on your continued efforts, ${name-player}.
    In the meantime, take this for your service.
    May it serve you well.${prompt}
  15006: |-
    Admirable work in Qufim, soldier. I did not think you had it in you.
    His Excellency has expressed great satisfaction in your accomplishments as well.${prompt}
  15007: |-
    And yet we cannot afford to become complacent.
    For each fiend we dispatch, a more abominable monstrosity rises to take its place.${prompt}
  15008: |-
    We have recovered much useful data from your encounters with the Voidwalkers.
    Data that an elite team of our best researchers works tirelessly to analyze.${prompt}
  15009: |-
    Yes, we must discover a means to seal the rifts once and for all.
    Then, and only then, will victory truly be ours.${prompt}
  15010: Until that day, we have no choice but to continue the fight.${prompt}
  15011: You have proven yourself a valuable ally to our cause.${prompt}
  15012: |-
    The Archduke himself trusts you greatly.
    That is one trust that you would do well not to betray.${prompt}
  15013: |-
    Take this for your efforts, and do not let up the fight.
    We will be watching you with great interest, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  15014: Pssst! ${name-player}!${prompt}
  15015: |-
    Over here! This way, I say!
    It's me! Cait Sith, your feline friend!${prompt}
  15016: Do forgive me for my appearance. Pardon my unfamiliar manifestation.${prompt}
  15017: You may think of it as sort of passing fancy. A cait's caprice.${prompt}
  15018: |-
    But there are more important matters a-paw.
    Matters that would best be discussed somewhere other than here, I fear.${prompt}
  15019: |-
    Let us rendezvous in the Pashhow Marshlands of the past. The age-old swamp.
    It's quite a trek, so take care and don't be late! Ta-ta, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  15020: |-
    There ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] is, kupo!
    Wherever have you been, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  15021: |-
    Heh... ${name-player} goes where adventure calls.
    But you can always trust ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] to show up when the time is right.${prompt}
  15022: |-
    Kupo-ho!
    ...So that's how it works.${prompt}
  15023: |-
    Well, look who's finally here.
    I was wondering how long you were going to keep me waitaruing.${prompt}
  15024: Hm? Why's that?${prompt}
  15025: |-
    Surely you haven't forgotten-wotten our contract, ${name-player}.
    I intend to keep my end of the bargain, so you'd bettaru live up to yours.${prompt}
  15026: 'Your mission, whether or not you choose to acceptaru it: amass ${number: 0} merit point${choice-plurality: 0}[/s] and return here to me.${prompt}'
  15027: |-
    Why, you say?
    Oh, just a little experiment of sorts.${prompt}
  15028: I've devised a method by which the power of merit points may be channel-wanneled to rip and wrench open the reserves of chakra that lie dormant within you.${prompt}
  15029: |-
    Getting excitarued yet? 'Cause I sure am.
    So what are you waiting for? ${number: 0} merit point${choice-plurality: 0}[/s], and make it snappy-wappy.${prompt}
  15030: |-
    Rip and wrench?
    That sounds awfully...violent, kupo.${prompt}
  15031: |-
    Indeed...
    And yet, it's a most accurate description. Heh heh...${prompt}
  15032: Kupopo?${prompt}
  15033: |-
    Hear me out, ${name-player}.
    Be strong of body and mind, and there is no limit to the powers you can master.${prompt}
  15034: You didn't sign that contract for the all-you-can-eat rarab tails, now, did you?${prompt}
  15035: |-
    Believe in yourself, and go forward, ${name-player}.
    Your destiny awaits.${prompt}
  15036: |-
    Back so soon?
    That's our ${name-player}!${prompt}
  15037: Heh. Never met a challenge ye didn't like, eh?${prompt}
  15038: |-
    Wow, you completed that task in a jiffy-wiffy.
    Looks like I made the right choice signing a contract with you.${prompt}
  15039: |-
    Well then, let's get this show on the road.
    Don't worry, ${name-player}--it'll be over in two shakes of a rarab's tail.${prompt}
  15040: |-
    Kupopo?
    Is it prudent to proceed with the process so promptly?${prompt}
  15041: |-
    Under normal circumstances, we'd take things a bit more slowly-wowly.
    But hey, ${name-player} and I are people in demand. Aren't we, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  15042: When I say go, we're going to condense all the merit power you've accumulated into one pulsating mass of energy, then proceed to rippy-wip that straight out from the core of your soul.${prompt}
  15043: |-
    Stay focused, and try not to blink.
    It might kill you.${prompt}
  15044: K-kupo!?${prompt}
  15045: '...${prompt}'
  15046: And that should do it!${prompt}
  15047: Did we kill ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]?${prompt}
  15048: Kupo...oh!?${prompt}
  15049: I've noted this numerous times before, but you really have a remarkably resilient body, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  15050: It's all the trainin' ${choice-player-gender}[he's/she's] put in with yours truly.${prompt}
  15051: |-
    Stand tall and proud...er, if you can still stand.
    The legendary power of the bushin is yours.${prompt}
  15052: Kupo!? That's how you pass along the power of the bushin!?${prompt}
  15053: It looked like you were just trying to blast poor ${name-player} into smithereens!${prompt}
  15054: More or less. It's the shock of the blastaru combined with the amassed power of ${name-player}'s merit points that triggers the reaction.${prompt}
  15055: By focusing all of those energies into one pulsating mass and ripping it out from within, we've opened up a veritable font of chakra inside ${name-player}'s body.${prompt}
  15056: A font...of chakra, kupo?${prompt}
  15057: They say such stores of power exist inside us all, yet most will train a lifetime without ever learnin' how to tap into 'em...${prompt}
  15058: |-
    You laid the foundation with your physical enhancements experiments, my fluttery, furry friend.
    I simply-wimply applied the finishing touches.${prompt}
  15059: |-
    But let's get to the heart of the mattaru, ${name-player}.
    What I've bestowed upon you today is but a foundation for powers that may yet be mastered.${prompt}
  15060: |-
    Listen, and listen well.
    Look within and take stock of your merits, and you'll see a new path open to you.${prompt}
  15061: |-
    Using the energies within you, I've burned into your soul the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    How you proceed from here is entirely up to you.${prompt}
  15062: |-
    For this is not the end of your training, but only the beginning.
    Or were you just bluffing-wuffing when you said you wanted to take me on? Haha!${prompt}
  15063: |-
    And with that, I'd best be off.
    I am a man in demand, after all.${prompt}
  15064: Before that, though, I really could use a good meal and a...<yawn>...nap.${prompt}
  15065: A man in demand? More like a lazy louse, kupo.${prompt}
  15066: |-
    As enigmatic as our friend is, the realm may never know.
    Heh heh...${prompt}
  15067: |-
    Let up not in your training, ${name-player}. The path to true martial mastery lies before you.
    Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some rarab tails t'--er, I mean, my trainin' to get back to.${prompt}
  15068: You learned the secret technique of the bushin!${prompt}
  15069: |-
    You've come. Splendid.
    We regret having to summon you again so soon after your last tour of duty, but the Duchy has need of your services again.${prompt}
  15070: Our research team has confirmed the presence of new rifts in the greater three nations area.${prompt}
  15071: |-
    Under normal circumstances, the defense effort would fall under the jurisdiction of the local governments.
    This time, however, I fear the circumstances are far from normal.${prompt}
  15072: |-
    I will be frank with you, ${name-player}.
    The strength of the enemy is beyond anything we've faced thus far.${prompt}
  15073: |-
    Here is your badge of authorization.
    Take it and report to the Voidwatch officers stationed afield for further orders.${prompt}
  15074: |-
    Once again, we have recruited other promising adventurers to our cause.
    You may find it in your best interests to join up with them before taking on the enemy.
    We're counting on you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  15075: |-
    I trust you've recovered from your last tour of duty.
    If not, so be it. Full strength or no, the Duchy requires your service.${prompt}
  15076: Ducal researchers have alerted us to the presence of newly formed planar rifts in the vicinity of the three kingdoms.${prompt}
  15077: |-
    Under normal circumstances we would let the nations fend for themselves.
    We fear that this time, however, their limited resources and manpower will do little to stem the tide of this formidable enemy.${prompt}
  15078: |-
    Hence, we turn to you.
    Take this badge of authorization and present it to our officers afield for further orders.${prompt}
  15079: |-
    We have recruited others for the effort as well.
    Join forces with them if you wish, or fight alone.
    Just remember: the success of the operation is more important than the life of any single soldier, including yours.${prompt}
  15080: As we trust you are already aware...${prompt}
  15081: |-
    Direct supervision of the Voidwatch operation will be conducted by our officers dispatched to the three nations.
    You are to follow their instructions to the letter.${prompt}
  15082: ${name-player}. Once again you prove that the Duchy's faith in you was not misplaced.${prompt}
  15083: |-
    You are an asset to the Voidwatch.
    And yet the data we have recovered from your efforts yields as many questions as answers.${prompt}
  15084: |-
    The Voidwalker menace has been quieted for now.
    Yet we would be fools to believe that our foe will remain silent for long.${prompt}
  15085: Until we can identify and eliminate the source of the threat, we have no recourse but to call upon you again.${prompt}
  15086: |-
    In the meantime, take this as recompense for your efforts.
    I trust you shall put it to good use.${prompt}
  15087: What is the meaning of this interruption!?${prompt}
  15088: |-
    My pardons. Your Excellency, we've received dire news from the field.
    Two new rifts have been confirmed at previously unbreached locations...${prompt}
  15089: Hmph. Two, you say?${prompt}
  15090: Aye. One buried in the sands of the Valkurm Dunes, the other on Buburimu Peninsula.${prompt}
  15091: Your Excellency...?${prompt}
  15092: |-
    This adventurer is a veteran Voidwatcher.
    I would have ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] hear your findings as well.${prompt}
  15093: |-
    At present, it responds to neither ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} nor ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.
    We are unable to gauge the potential danger of any Voidwalkers that may lie beyond.${prompt}
  15094: |-
    Intriguing.
    So the portal between dimensions is not yet fully formed...${prompt}
  15095: |-
    It is only a matter of time before the monsters spring forth.
    Let up your watch not for a second, and send word the moment you detect anything amiss.${prompt}
  15096: Sir! Yes, sir!${prompt}
  15097: It would seem your next mission will begin sooner rather than later, soldier.${prompt}
  15098: |-
    We will authorize you for participation at such time as it is necessary.
    In the meantime, I suggest you rest up and prepare yourself for the challenges ahead.${prompt}
  15099: |-
    Too much remains unknown about these rifts.
    I grow impatient with our researchers and their incessant pleas for more time.${prompt}
  15100: |-
    I concur. The situation threatens to spiral out of control.
    We cannot afford to play the dispassionate observer for much longer.${prompt}
  15101: ${name-player} has proved a most useful...resource...in the pursuit of our goals.${prompt}
  15102: |-
    And yet there are limits to what one adventurer--or even an army of them--can do.
    It seems that we have no choice but to get involved more...directly.${prompt}
  15103: '...Yes, Your Excellency.${prompt}'
  15104: |-
    It would seem the Voidwatch effort in the three nations was a success.
    Once again, you prove yourself not entirely useless.${prompt}
  15105: |-
    The Archduke will be pleased.
    And yet the Voidwalker menace persists.${prompt}
  15106: The data we have recovered from your latest mission is...not promising.${prompt}
  15107: |-
    More details? I think you forget your station, soldier.
    You will get the information you are authorized to receive, and no more.${prompt}

    Let it suffice to say that we will have need of your services again.
    Stay alive, and do not stray too far.${prompt}
  15109: |-
    I am sure you understand why we have summoned you on such short notice.
    Yes, it does indeed concern the Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  15110: Recently, however, some new facts have come to light. Reports confirm a new substance that can be culled from those planes-walking fiends.${prompt}
  15111: 'It is said to possess two separate forms: one is that of a crystal, the other of a more granular structure resembling cruor. Its alabaster hue, however, serves to distinguish it from that vermilion currency.${prompt}'
  15112: While it may exhibit crystalline properties, it is unlike any specimen of crystal we have heretofore examined. The oft-used phrase “shrouded in mystery” does not begin to describe how it baffles even our most accomplished researchers.${prompt}
  15113: We may have nothing more to guide us than conjecture, but we cannot discard the possibility that this mineral is an integral piece in the calamitous puzzle that Vana'diel faces. Do not hesitate to collect as large a sample as possible of this mysterious mineral.${prompt}
  15114: Should you require further intelligence, seek out a Voidwatch Officer. As they are the ones who operate in the field, they should be privy to the most current of information.${prompt}
  15115: Furthermore...${prompt}
  15116: Whether as hardened stone or dust deposits, this substance is less than abundant.${prompt}
  15117: Voidwatch Officers should be willing to part with some samples, however, should you fail to harvest any off of Voidwalker corpses.${prompt}
  15118: No matter the method by which you obtain it, this mineral should shine new light on this catastrophe and allow you to more efficiently aid our cause.${prompt}
  15119: To the extent of our knowledge, there is no new planar rift activity, but you of all people should understand the spontaneous nature of these interdimensional disturbances. None of us can let our guard down for even a moment.${prompt}
  15120: |-
    Archduke Kam'lanaut expects great things of you as well.
    It is quite regrettable that he could not honor us with his presence today, but he is a busy man with many entice--er, engagements.${prompt}
  15121: Now that you understand how you can be of service, it is time you got to your duties. Let us conclude this parley.${prompt}
  15122: Hmm...something's not right here.${prompt}
  15123: I would have expected their reports to have arrived by now...${prompt}

  15128: To find an adventurer such as yourself so quickly! Fortune indeed shines upon me this day!${prompt}
  15129: But where are my manners? I have not yet introduced myself. I am Anastase, an emissary sent from the Sacred City of Adoulin.${prompt}
  15130: But of course, you need not say anything. I know why you have sought me out.${prompt}
  15131: You are here to assist me in surveying the geomagnetic founts, yes?${prompt}
  15132: |-
    Lend your aid?
    ${selection-lines}
    I shall.
    Not interested.
    Hear more.${prompt}
  15133: I see. I must admit to feeling a twinge of disappointment, but I understand.${prompt}
  15134: My stay here will be a long one, so if you have a change of heart, please come and see me again.${prompt}
  15135: Have you changed your mind? Will you help me study the geomagnetic founts?${prompt}
  15136: I come from the Sacred City of Adoulin, an island that lies far to the west, beyond the great Sea of Zafmlug.${prompt}
  15137: Further still beyond the island is the continent of Ulbuka, where a pristine expanse of nature sits unsullied by mortal hands.${prompt}
  15138: Tales of men and women from the Middle Lands who cannot resist the clarion call of a good deed left undone have stretched across the sea and reached my ears. Hearing these tales prompted me to make the arduous journey here.${prompt}
  15139: For you see, I desire your assistance in our quest to pioneer the undeveloped lands of Ulbuka.${prompt}
  15140: I had hoped to secure transport in advance for those interested in cooperating with this enterprise.${prompt}
  15141: But executing a plan is never a simple affair. Air and sea vessels are indeed available, but unsustainable in the long term due to the staggering distance between the two continents.${prompt}
  15142: Yet one possibility exists. In our beloved city, devices called “waypoints” allow the user to instantaneously move from one location to another.${prompt}
  15143: However, I am not certain whether the ley lines to which these waypoints are attuned traverse the oceans to the Middle Lands. My first task, therefore, is to find locations suitable for such travel.${prompt}
  15144: '${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} are needed to use our waypoints, but their efficacy is dependent on recording the energies of certain geomagnetic founts.${prompt}'
  15145: 'As part of this mission, I have brought with me several such ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}. What I would ask of you is that you take one to these various founts and attune it to them.${prompt}'
  15146: Unfortunately, there is precious little time to collect this information.${prompt}
  15147: As I have previously mentioned, my fervent hope is that you will undertake this mission. The very fate of my homeland hangs in the balance.${prompt}
  15148: 'What I ask is that you use ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to...oh?${prompt}'

  15151: 'What I would ask of you is that you attune the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to the aforementioned geomagnetic founts.${prompt}'
  15152: If this survey is successful, then it will surely guarantee a prosperous trading partnership for our two homelands.${prompt}
  15153: I also imagine that there are many who would both honor and value your accomplishment.${prompt}
  15154: 'Your help is sincerely appreciated. Let me present you with this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  15155: Attuning it to a geomagnetic fount will, if my calculations are correct, permit you to use the waypoints.${prompt}
  15156: I have already recorded the energies of the Ru'Lude Gardens fount. Please, travel throughout the world and proceed with your activities, and return to me when you have attuned it to another fount.${prompt}
  15157: Having never been to this land, I am not familiar with the exact locations, but our powers of divination have given us a certain cryptic insight.${prompt}

  15167: Well, this certainly is quite perplexing. I only apologize that I cannot help you further.${prompt}

  15169: Quite a simple task, no?${prompt}
  15170: 'I shall be waiting here to collect your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} when you have completed this endeavor.${prompt}'
  15171: Many years have I spent researching and analyzing these phenomena. Sensing any changes in the object I have given you is merely a trifle.${prompt}
  15172: To a layman's eyes, though, any deviations are impossible to detect.${prompt}
  15173: My hope is that, should these portals become fully active, even the uninitiated will be able to make such determinations with ease.${prompt}
  15174: I am sure you have noticed this mysterious device resting at my side. In Adoulin, we refer to items of its ilk as “waypoints.”${prompt}
  15175: 'These portals enable instantaneous transportation between two locations simply by holding up ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to them.${prompt}'
  15176: I am sure that now you understand the implications of my calling--if the geomagnetic founts are as strong as our research implies, then the waypoints should function here, as well.${prompt}
  15177: As we record information about the founts, we should be able to warp between more locations.${prompt}
  15178: However, there is always a price to be paid for convenience. Warping consumes a tiny bit of energy extracted from certain types of crystals.${prompt}
  15179: 'This energy, which in my field''s parlance is referred to as “kinetic units,” is imbued in ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} when extracted from these crystals.${prompt}'
  15180: Kinetic units are consumed each time you warp, meaning that periodic imbuing is necessary for continued use of the waypoints.${prompt}
  15181: Ah yes, before I forget--other members of my expedition have already gone to survey these locations.${prompt}
  15182: Should you happen to cross paths with them, make sure to emphasize that I am still waiting for their reports.${prompt}

  15189: You have my undying gratitude for your efforts. Allow me to present this to you as a mere token of my appreciation.${prompt}

  15421: So you want to absolutely avoid heading home?${prompt}
  15422: But if I don't bring you back, she'll scour my skin and skewer my sides!${prompt}
  15423: Sorry, little friend, but I'm not doing it!
  15424: Kupo! Not entirely unexpected.${prompt}
  15425: Your loving wife may lamentably leave you, kupo!${prompt}
  15426: B-but I don't want to spend the end of my days rotting alone!${prompt}
  15427: |-
    ...Dare I entertain the thought?
    Maybe if I had an alter ego...${prompt}
  15428: One of the academics from the Jeuno Institute of Magical Studies told me something when I received my scroll.${prompt}
  15429: “The energies of Trust magic are a representation of the bonds of trust, friendship, and camaraderie between two individuals.”${prompt}
  15430: Perhaps...perhaps I should rethink my stance. If I can “serve” others, then so be it.${prompt}
  15431: ${name-player}! Steel yourself!${prompt}
  15432: How many times have we sparred, and how many times have you emerged the victor? If anyone has strong bonds with me, it would be you!${prompt}
  15433: Do you remember the trials the Magian Moogles gave? The ones you passed with flying colors?${prompt}
  15434: Power comes from the gut, my ${choice-player-gender}[boy/girl]. And using a gut like yours, my alter ego would be able to withstand any sucker punch my wife throws its way!${prompt}
  15435: A stomach smacker? My tummy trembles at the thought, kupo...${prompt}
  15436: You were also made to suffer the ill effects of “brown magic” as a bit of an...experiment.${prompt}
  15437: When you say it that way, it sounds so sordid.${prompt}
  15438: But now you've got a liver of steel! My alter ego should be able to withstand any shots to the organs my honey might dish out!${prompt}
  15439: There was also that time when I engaged in a fierce struggle with my eternal nemesis, Degenhard. Boy, you sure got caught up in our squabbles--but somehow remained unscathed.${prompt}
  15440: I thought my aura would be too much for you to handle, but you pulled through by the skin of your teeth.${prompt}
  15441: |-
    ...${wait-36: 1}
    That's not how it happened, kupo.${prompt}
  15442: My old lady's got a bit of a fire aura herself, so any alter ego I make with you can surely withstand the heat!${prompt}
  15443: I also remember those “special eastern techniques” they put you through when you were frustrated with your limits once more.${prompt}
  15444: I can still see the look on that old biddy Chamama's face when that...thing came out of you. Half disgust, half curiosity.${prompt}
  15445: '...I''d be careful about calling a budding beauty like her a “biddy.”${prompt}'
  15446: Surely the alter ego we create will woo my wife into a lovelorn stupor!${prompt}
  15447: (She'd slap him silly if she saw his bluster and bravado, kupo...)${prompt}
  15448: This'll flare up some painful memories, but... Remember that infernal contract you signed?${prompt}
  15449: The one with Atori-Tutori?${prompt}
  15450: Far be it from me to use the term “lust for power,” but...well, you're a braver ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] than I!${prompt}
  15451: Beyond doubt, the alter ego we call into being will fear nothing--nor will it sweat the small stuff!${prompt}
  15452: Such arrogant apologies would make her apoplectic, kupo...${prompt}
  15453: And finally, do you remember when I gave you a little present?${prompt}
  15454: When the time comes, and I pass on...${prompt}
  15455: I want you to take my hat, stand here in my place, and spread your wings.${prompt}
  15456: But I don't cling to illusions. I know you want to go out there, adventure, and meet lots of ${choice-player-gender}[pretty young women/strapping young lads].${prompt}
  15457: Maybe...maybe I could join too, kupo?${prompt}
  15458: Floating here is as boring as balancing boxes.${prompt}
  15459: |-
    Mayhaps my alter ego'd be a help then...
    His back would give out easily, though, so don't make it too tough on him! Heh heh.${prompt}
  15460: |-
    <Sigh>...
    Such a base boor you can be...${prompt}
  15461: I'd hurry up, kupo. Maat's tremendously tired.${prompt}
  15462: In any event. The bonds we share will surely cultivate something special!${prompt}
  15463: |-
    If you say no, then...${wait-36: 1}
    ...then I've got to face the music.${prompt}
  15464: And Maat was never deft at dancing, kupo.${prompt}
  15465: Urk... Please! I'm begging you! Don't give up on me now!${prompt}
  15466: Success, kupo!
  15467: We did it!
  15468: All who face me are like guppies before a shark! Heh heh heh!${prompt}
  15469: Positively peachy! Now you can turn the tides against your storming spouse!${prompt}
  15470: M-my...spouse...?${prompt}
  15471: Go forth, my alter ego! I'm getting tired of sleeping in the doghouse!${prompt}
  15472: B-but what if she takes her wrath out on me!? Forget it, I'm not going!
  15473: I knew it straight from the start, kupo!${prompt}
  15474: Have heart, Maat! There are always ample supplies of adventurers!${prompt}
  15475: |-
    <Sigh>
    I suppose you're right...after all, I've worked hard these long years.${prompt}
  15476: Good luck with all your alter egos, ${name-player}, and remember to never give up, no matter the cost!${prompt}
  15477: Phew. When I agreed to get involved with the Trust initiative, I didn't imagine it to be so...trying.${prompt}
  15478: |-
    Hmmmmmm...
    I was sure poring over these annals of history would be enough.${prompt}
  15479: Oh ho? Do my eyes deceive me, or are you a Trust initiate?${prompt}
  15480: |-
    Are you an initiate?
    ${selection-lines}
    No...
    Uh, what are you doing?${prompt}
  15481: No? Then perhaps I need to take a break. I thought I read your magical aura properly, but my endless hours of study must have taken their toll.${prompt}
  15482: Well, there was the one gentlewoman who claims to have called forth an alter ego all by herself.${prompt}
  15483: Could you imagine what this means for our research? We may be on the verge of an incredible breakthrough!${prompt}
  15484: Rumors say that intimate knowledge of the person she was trying to summon was sufficient to complete the ritual. So here I am, researching, trying to replicate her success with a historical figure.${prompt}
  15485: 'But it''s no good. Without the bonds, we just can''t do it! The closest we''ve come is to craft ciphers--magical parchments that concentrate energies from a third party into physical forms. But that''s the rub: it still requires those bonds in the first place.${prompt}'
  15486: But someday...someday...${prompt}
  15487: Where are my manners? You didn't come here to hear a stuffy scholar's ramblings.${prompt}
  15488: |-
    And just look at you!${wait-36: 2}
    Fascinating...${prompt}
  15489: |-
    Yes, your aura...${wait-36: 1}
    I've done it again, haven't I? A thousand pardons. I asked if you were part of the Trust initiative, but you are so much more than that.${prompt}
  15490: 'Take this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} as a gift from the institute. It''s a cipher crafted from the very process I spoke of earlier.${prompt}'
  15491: The emotions of separate individuals converted into magical energy. Extraordinary, wouldn't you agree? Calling forth an alter ego with the thoughts of a third party.${prompt}
  15492: It's all very experimental, so I make no promises as to the efficacy of such a scroll. It's all we can do to keep the energies from collapsing in on themselves.${prompt}
  15493: Unlike a traditional scroll, these ciphers cannot be recited by anyone with a passing level of literacy. They require the assistance of certain institute staff located in major cities throughout Vana'diel.${prompt}
  15494: Still, I promise the journey will be worth it...for you, and for us.${prompt}
  15495: Bonds cannot be severed like a hot knife cutting through Selbina butter. The key is whether or not the strengths of the bonds' creators are enough to survive transcription.${prompt}
  15496: If there's someone who you feel a strong connection with, what can it hurt to ask them for their cooperation? You'll never know until you try!${prompt}
  15497: Hello. Can I help you?${prompt}
  15498: 'Hm? You''re here about ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  15499: I'm sorry you came all this way, but I've already been briefed on that particular topic.${prompt}
  15500: Wait just a moment. Ah, now I remember you. Yes, I've been looking for you ever since our last encounter. Now, I need you in the field to help with my research...${prompt}
  15501: Ah, forgive me. I was so excited to find the person I was looking for, I forgot to explain what it is I'm doing.${prompt}
  15502: I've heard from a colleague that my research into Trust magic has earned the recognition of an academic organization.${prompt}
  15503: They have even given me clearance to read their most confidential documents in pursuit of my research. Well, a portion of them at least.${prompt}
  15504: However, when comparing that information against what I had gathered, I came across some interesting discoveries.${prompt}
  15505: For example, I learned that you had defeated an unusual life-form considered to be the physical embodiment of the darkest parts of a person's soul.${prompt}
  15506: Then it struck me--a new line of thought in my Trust magic research.${prompt}
  15507: That's right. I'm researching the topic of a dark Trust magic!${prompt}
  15508: |-
    How will you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    Dark Trust magic?
    I see where this is going.${prompt}
  15509: Huh? You mean you don't know?${prompt}
  15510: Oh you do, do you?${prompt}
  15511: Well, allow me to briefly explain things just in case.${prompt}
  15512: Currently, the Trust magic you use is based on light. It draws on positive forces such as trust, friendship, and ${choice-player-gender}[brotherly/sisterly] love.${prompt}
  15513: On the other hand, Trust magic based on darkness draws upon negative forces to generate its magic, much like how that woman was able to accomplish what she did.${prompt}
  15514: Oh, I suppose I'm leaving out some rather important information. That is to say, an explanation of the negative aspects of mankind's darker side.${prompt}
  15515: I'm basically referring to things like apathy, arrogance, cowardice, envy, and rage. You know, the darkest parts of one's soul. I believe that everybody harbors these feelings, at least to a certain extent.${prompt}
  15516: In a sense, all of us are united by the darkness within our souls. Therefore, it only seems logical to infer that we have the necessary conditions to employ Trust magic from it.${prompt}
  15517: All that remains is to try and elevate the darkness within the alter ego's soul and somehow link up with it...a type of bond all its own.${prompt}
  15518: 'Although, even if we are unable to utilize the Trust magic, we have the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} at our disposal. Intimate knowledge of your quarry should enable you to form a bond with them.${prompt}'
  15519: Which brings me to my request. I'd like for you to test your mettle against those unique forces. However, it cannot be any regular fight. You must really get to know your opponent.${prompt}
  15520: I requested the A.M.A.N. to create a Records of Eminence objective for this purpose, so it should help you remain cognizant of your opponent during battle.${prompt}
  15521: Hm? You want to know how to fight this particular opponent again? I think you probably know more about that sort of thing than I do.${prompt}
  15522: You learn more about Trust magic, and I get further along in my research. That's what I call a “win-win.”${prompt}
  15523: I heard from my colleague that he obtained a rather unusual cipher. Perhaps you should see this through to its conclusion?${prompt}
  15524: Ah, it's you again. It seems everything went rather well.${prompt}
  15525: Judging by the magical aura you're giving off, I'd say we got the results I was hoping for.${prompt}
  15526: Keep in mind that Trust magic research is an ongoing process. I must continue my efforts to unlock its mysteries.${prompt}
  15527: I'm working on preparations for my next study. Please come by again later.${prompt}
  15528: Hello again. I've finished making the necessary preparations. This is the data I'm searching for this time.${prompt}
  15529: Thanks again for your help.${prompt}
  15530: If the test results for this darkness-based Trust magic follow my hypothesis, then my next step will be to research Trust magic that combines the power of both light and darkness.${prompt}
  15531: I believe Trust magic that combines the power of light and darkness no longer just gives rise to alter egos, but a unique form of existence.${prompt}
  15532: An alter ego combining the power of both light and darkness... Just think of what this could mean!${prompt}
  15533: Although, I'm currently suffering from a lack of research samples.${prompt}
  15534: In order to successfully realize dark-based Trust magic, I tried replicating the connection that my research was based on, but it is not going so well...${prompt}
  15535: If only I could get to the truth of the matter, it could be like a ticket to eternal paradise without the unfortunate precursor of dying first.${prompt}
  15536: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Rolandienne in Southern San d'Oria (G-10).
  15537: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Isakoth in Bastok Markets (E-11).
  15538: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Fhelm Jobeizat in Windurst Woods (J-10).
  15539: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Eternal Flame in Western Adoulin (H-11).
  15540: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Nantoto in Lower Jeuno (H-8).

  15568: “You will be rewarded with gil and sparks of eminence, which serve the same function as points, notes, credits, and other such methods of quantifying one's greatness. As an extra incentive, adventurers will earn three times the amount of sparks for completing an objective the first time.${prompt}

  15614: I am pleased to see you make such a wise decision! Hehe... I cannot wait to see that buffoon Jamal choke on his own words!${prompt}
  15615: Now then! Jamal likes to equate the darkness of alter egos to the root of all evil or some such nonsense, but as with most things, he could not be more wrong.${prompt}
  15616: These are just my thoughts on the issue, but...${prompt}
  15617: You see, unlike Jamal, I do not believe that Trust magic is something meant to be cast outwards from its user.${prompt}
  15618: No, Trust magic is designed to look within us. In other words...${prompt}
  15619: The alter egos take shape due to the power contained within a kind of unseen pipeline inside of us that conveys our feelings and thoughts to them.${prompt}
  15620: That got me thinking! If one could somehow boost the amount of those feelings and thoughts being sent...${prompt}
  15621: It could lead to the alter ego itself becoming even more powerful!${prompt}
  15622: Hm? What do you mean you don't understand? You really are quite dense, aren't you?${prompt}
  15623: Well, I am stuck with you, I guess, so you will need a few things if you are to help me with my research.${prompt}
  15624: First of all, you will need this special diamond.${prompt}
  15625: It is capable of detecting the feelings and thoughts you direct at the alter ego you are summoning.${prompt}
  15626: This diamond then stores them within its crystalline confines.${prompt}
  15627: Once it has gathered a certain amount of thoughts and feelings, it will change color.${prompt}
  15628: So basically, I need you to use your Trust magic until you see the diamond change color!${prompt}
  15629: To help you to that end, I have also prepared something else for you.${prompt}
  15630: I ordered the A.M.A.N. to provide you with a list of Records of Eminence objectives!${prompt}
  15631: There are three objectives for you to complete. You simply need to complete them all to collect what is necessary!${prompt}
  15632: Ah, that reminds me. No matter what, you must not lose this diamond.${prompt}
  15633: It is made from an extremely rare gemstone, so I forced my mother's jewelry shop to let me have it.${prompt}
  15634: It was originally a rather unusual diamond that changed color whenever it sensed a change in the surrounding temperature.${prompt}
  15635: I simply used a little magic to make some key improvements and recreate something from a legend I once heard in a faraway land!${prompt}
  15636: Now then, let us begin the experiment!${prompt}
  15637: Ah, there you are! I was expecting you much sooner. Hurry up and hand me the diamond already.${prompt}
  15638: Hmm... Very well done. You have collected just the right amount of thoughts and feelings. Now, for just a touch of magic...${prompt}
  15639: I-it's a staggering success! The thoughts have been imbued into the diamond!${prompt}
  15640: Listen carefully. You simply need to use this diamond as a catalyst when invoking your Trust magic.${prompt}
  15641: When you do, the thoughts sent to your alter ego when it manifests will be made even more powerful.${prompt}
  15642: That power will then be sent to the alter ego when you attempt to call upon it.${prompt}
  15643: As a result, the alter ego itself will also become stronger!${prompt}
  15644: However, there is one thing you need to be careful of.${prompt}
  15645: The more of these pipelines you use to call forth the alter egos, the weaker the effect of the catalyst will become.${prompt}
  15646: I can see that your feeble mind is not comprehending what I am saying. Let me see, how can I dumb this down so even you can understand it...${prompt}
  15647: If your party is made up of you and five alter egos, that means that five pipelines will be used, so each alter ego will only be slightly powered up.${prompt}
  15648: And if your party contains you and one other member, along with four alter egos, that means there would be four alter ego pipelines and each one will be a little stronger.${prompt}
  15649: Finally, if there are five in your party along with only one alter ego, that means there is also only one alter ego pipeline, so it will be made considerably stronger.${prompt}
  15650: Do you understand now? Yes? I am glad to hear it.${prompt}
  15651: Take note that the catalyst will not be effective unless you yourself are of considerable strength.${prompt}
  15652: You must be strong if you wish to extract the power from the catalyst.${prompt}
  15653: Now get out there and experience the fruits of my research for yourself!${prompt}

    How can I get people to like me?
    What shouldn't I do?
    What happens if we don't mesh?${prompt}
  15741: Perhaps consider starting with a simple greeting. Something like...${prompt}
  15742: “Hello, everyone. My name's ${name-player}. Nice to meet you!”${prompt}
  15743: Of course, injecting your own personal flavor may act as a conversation starter and help people to remember you.${prompt}
  15744: No matter which route you choose, make sure to always remain polite. There is no better way to start a friendship off on the right foot.${prompt}
  15745: When speaking with others, it's critical to listen and be mindful of what they say.${prompt}
  15746: Always talking and never listening may come across as rude.${prompt}
  15747: Another important point is to always be mindful of the listener. How would you feel if someone said that to you? Think carefully before sending someone a message.${prompt}
  15748: It also helps to be clear and concise.${prompt}
  15749: Being vague might cause others to get the wrong impression.${prompt}
  15750: Be extremely careful when giving out personal information such as your address or telephone number.${prompt}
  15751: Furthermore, refrain from making disparaging or aggressive remarks.${prompt}
  15752: Once you are close to someone, you may be more comfortable letting your hair down, but it is strongly recommended that you refrain from any actions that may be construed as harassment.${prompt}
  15753: After joining a linkshell, you may find that you have difficulty participating in conversation or that your personality is too different from the other members.${prompt}
  15754: One of your options in such a situation is to inform the linkshell leader and then leave.${prompt}
  15755: Finding a linkshell that is the perfect fit might not always be easy, but there is certainly a group out there that will match your feelings and goals.${prompt}
  15756: Once you find those kinds of friends, hold them fast and value them as much as they value you. There is no better way to enjoy life in Vana'diel.${prompt}
  15757: The linkshell concierge opens up a tiny notebook...
  15758: ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}, please forgive my hasty departure earlier. I have had some time to reflect on my journey here...${prompt}
  15759: It is about the Emptiness threatening to consume my land.${prompt}
  15760: I surmise that it is intimately connected to this destructive force that threatens to claim the future, just as Gilgamesh was telling me in Norg.${prompt}
  15761: The Emptiness will have doubtlessly spread from the Far East, its tendrils stretching ever westward.${prompt}
  15762: ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}, forgive me...would that I had been stronger...${prompt}
  15763: But you know what it means for me to be standing before you here.${prompt}
  15764: ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}, you know what it means for me to be standing before you here.${prompt}
  15765: I must confess to stationing one of my agents around the area after our soiree in Norg.${prompt}
  15766: It was not for any nefarious purpose, I assure you--it was merely to gather what information I could about the destruction of the future.${prompt}
  15767: And as I implied earlier, the Emptiness is almost certainly the cause of Iroha's claims.${prompt}
  15768: ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}, the Emptiness ceased to encroach when Prishe and her companions toppled Promathia.${prompt}
  15769: Something horrific must have happened for it to rear its head once more.${prompt}
  15770: I would ask Iroha to tell me what she knows.${prompt}
  15771: Forgive me for keeping you waiting, Master.${prompt}
  15772: Sir Tenzen, the pleasure is mine.${prompt}
  15773: I am so glad to see you again.${prompt}
  15774: Again? But this is the first time we...${prompt}
  15775: Ah, but of course. You mean to say that you have met me in the future.${prompt}
  15776: You are the very reason I am able to stand here today. My tears flowed like rain when last we parted.${prompt}
  15777: '...You mean to say that I was swallowed up in the Emptiness.${prompt}'
  15778: Not just you. Everyone.${prompt}
  15779: I thought myself better prepared for this. So such a future does come to pass.${prompt}
  15780: Then that means...I failed.${prompt}
  15781: Sir Tenzen, lift your head.${prompt}
  15782: In my era, you and the master were revered as heroes of the highest caliber.${prompt}
  15783: It was not any failure on your behalf. When darkness poured forth from the crystal, there was nothing you could have done to stop it.${prompt}
  15784: Secluded on that small island, I was unable to stem the rising tide, and the world was torn asunder...${prompt}
  15785: Heavens be good...${prompt}
  15786: There is only one thing we can do.${prompt}
  15787: The question that remains...is why?${prompt}
  15788: Has some nefarious new force arisen to force open the Gates of Paradise?${prompt}
  15789: Or is there another threatening to absorb the power of the crystals for its own vile ends?${prompt}
  15790: Neither you nor Master shared with me the particulars.${prompt}
  15791: Strife descended upon us in but an instant. Umbral energies radiated from the crystal, and the world was wrapped in gloom before we had a chance to draw breath.${prompt}
  15792: You mean that we were obliterated into the darkness without knowing why?${prompt}
  15793: Or was there a reason why we could not tell you?${prompt}
  15794: I fear the plot will continue to thicken.${prompt}
  15795: Then there is only one thing to do!${prompt}
  15796: We must protect our world!${prompt}
  15797: ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}, Lady Iroha.${prompt}
  15798: The future is ours for the taking, and I swear to fight until I have drawn my last breath!${prompt}
  15799: Wh-what!?
  15800: Does it mean to absorb the fire burning in my heart!?${prompt}
  15801: No, Sir Tenzen. Your passion has brought new life unto the orb!${prompt}
  15802: Would that it were sufficient...but the light remains ever pale.${prompt}
  15803: You have yet to meet with Lady Prishe, correct?${prompt}
  15804: Master, when you recounted tales of your exploits, Lady Prishe was a prominent figure. You oft waxed lyrical about how her prowess was beyond compare.${prompt}
  15805: Prishe...? Who is this woman of whom you speak?${prompt}
  15806: Ah, so the two of you have yet to cross paths.${prompt}
  15807: This would explain why the orb is scarce as bright as a torch.${prompt}
  15808: Lady Prishe has but recently arrived in Jeuno.${prompt}
  15809: Permit me to seek her out and lead her to the port.${prompt}
  15810: Our next destination is clear to us.${prompt}
  15811: She is, of course, here in Jeuno.${prompt}
  15812: Yet I fear for her health. We should first complete our business in Pso'Xja while she recovers.${prompt}
  15813: ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}, forgive me my brashness, but I must insist that that should be our first course of action.${prompt}
  15814: Let us petition for her assistance once she has rejoined us in the world of the living.${prompt}
  15815: Port Jeuno would seem as good a place as any to reunite.${prompt}
  15816: Perhaps we should call her back to Jeuno.${prompt}
  15817: Permit me to seek her out and lead her to the port.${prompt}
  15818: I would offer to bring her back here to Jeuno myself...${prompt}

  15821: Let us meet back in Port Jeuno once Prishe's hands are free.${prompt}
  15822: Master, the fire in Sir Tenzen's heart is evident. You must meet with Prishe without delay.${prompt}
  15823: I must confess that the only reason I am standing here today to aid you...${prompt}
  15824: '...is that I received a benevolent puissance when you and Sir Tenzen visited me on Reisenjima during the ultimate conflict.${prompt}'
  15825: Yet I must reiterate that I do not exist in this era.${prompt}
  15826: My presence has caused the wheel of fate to spin, and I fear that it may not come to rest in an advantageous position.${prompt}
  15827: Yet should you remain ever unflinching as you tackle this most arduous of journeys...${prompt}
  15828: Then perhaps my appearance here matters not, and you will be able to lead us to a brighter future.${prompt}
