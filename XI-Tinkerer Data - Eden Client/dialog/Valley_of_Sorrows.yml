    Very well, I will pass it on to you.

  7403: It is a pity, indeed.${prompt}
  7404: This day has come far too soon for my liking.${prompt}
  7405: |-
    However, you are a master of the ninja trade.
    I concede that you will make a fitting wielder of the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}

    ...
    This day has finally come.${prompt}

    I am to be released to this world for the first time in an age.

  7413: In any event...${prompt}
  7414: What is going on here?${prompt}
  7415: Ah, my successor has come.${prompt}
  7416: 'I sought to master the way of the samurai, and traveled to the Far East for training. By the time I had gained the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and returned to my home, the Great War had begun.${prompt}'

  7425: I have heard of your coming.${prompt}
  7426: You are to be the new master of this hammer of war?${prompt}
  7427: |-
    Every time ${item-singular: 0[2]} is reborn it gains a new wielder, who ultimately must pass it on to a successor.
    I have swung this hammer for more than eight hundred years. I never wished to part with it.${prompt}
  7428: "However, there is little meaning in me keeping it now. \nIf you will wield this weapon for a just cause, I hand its power over to you.${prompt}"
  7429: |-
    Now, take the hammer and go!
    Just be careful with how you handle it.
    Do not let its might crush you as well...${prompt}
  7430: '...${prompt}'
  7431: My might is yours to wield.${prompt}
  7432: Go forth and experience the destructive power that laid low the Earth Serpent...${prompt}

    I must give you my thanks.
    I have been freed from the hell of Dynamis and can regain my true power once again.${prompt}
  7435: And now...${prompt}
  7436: Hwaah!${prompt}
  7437: Just when I thought I had finally returned to this world, I find you standing here, ready to snatch my precious staff away.${prompt}
  7438: |-
    Well, it's for the best, I suppose.
    In my current state, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is nothing more than an ornament, its power going to waste.${prompt}
  7439: |-
    I entrust this staff to you!
    Take up ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${name-player}, and bind it to you in a contract of blood!${prompt}

    I take my leave of you now.
    I only wish that I was able to stay a little longer...${prompt}
  7441: '...${prompt}'
  7442: I am yours to wield.${prompt}
  7443: |-
    But you are not yet my master.
    By watching your actions from this time onwards, I will decide if you are worthy of the title...${prompt}
  7444: |-
    ...
    You have discovered my resting place.${prompt}
  7445: |-
    The prison of souls has let loose its shackles, and I am free to loose arrows in this world once more.
    My thanks.${prompt}
  7446: Ah, one more test of your patience...${prompt}
  7447: Where is this place?${prompt}
  7448: |-
    Of course. How could I forget.
    I am Ghebben. I was entrusted with this bow by a warrior of the Far East.${prompt}
  7449: |-
    Your hands tell me that your skill in archery is far from ordinary.
    ${item-singular: 0[2]} will fit snugly into your sure grasp.${prompt}

    However, this bow belongs to Sir Nasu, the warrior of whom I spoke.
    You must remember that you are merely its keeper for a time.${prompt}
  7451: Farewell...${prompt}
  7452: '...${prompt}'
  7453: |-
    It is an honor to be owned by a just master.
    Sir Ghebben was a truly splendid archer.${prompt}
  7454: |-
    You are now the one to draw me in battle.
    I will be at your side on any road you choose to travel, along with the destructive power of my arrows.${prompt}
  7455: |-
    ...
    We finally meet.${prompt}
  7456: I am now free from the pit of Dynamis to spit fire in this world once again.${prompt}
  7457: But I must ask you to wait before taking me into your possession...${prompt}
  7458: |-
    Why'd you have to go and wake me up? I was having the most relaxing sleep.
    Oh, this place looks familiar...${prompt}
  7459: Hm? You think you're the one who's going to take up my gun?${prompt}
  7460: 'You do seem to have a fair eye for marksmanship. And ${item-singular: 0[2]} would look perfect nestled in the crook of your arm...${prompt}'
  7461: Well, I have no more use for this weapon, so I guess you can have it. But there is one thing I want you to remember.${prompt}
  7462: This gun is a fearsome weapon that unleashes a blast upon your enemies many thousands of times greater in strength than the tiny effort it takes you to pull the trigger. Needless to say, be careful who you aim it at...${prompt}
  7463: '...${prompt}'
  7464: A weapon has no will of its own. But it was made for a purpose.${prompt}
  7465: Take me to a new battlefield, a new arena for the hunt...${prompt}
  7466: |-
    ...
    I am saved.${prompt}
  7467: Silenced for too long in the prison of Dynamis, I can once again let my brazen call echo through this land!${prompt}

    You've never heard of me?
    Before joining the army I was quite the famous bard, mobbed by fans in every town I passed through.${prompt}
  7471: 'To be completely truthful, I am heartbroken to be giving up the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the most famous of instruments, even to a fellow bard.${prompt}'
  7472: But an instrument only shows its true worth when being played. This horn should be delighted to be passed on to such a talent as yourself.${prompt}
  7473: She has a capricious soul, but do treat her well. And do not forget that even without a raging battle, you can still play a tune for the simple enjoyment of those around you...${prompt}
  7474: '...${prompt}'
  7475: He was a wonderful performer.${prompt}

  10742: |-
    What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo!
    Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!${prompt}
  10743: |-
    We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers.
    But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!${prompt}

    Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!${prompt}
  10745: |-
    Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo.
    Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom.
    It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!${prompt}
  10746: The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!${prompt}
  10747: |-
    In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign.
    Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.${prompt}
  10748: Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...${prompt}
  10749: |-
    King Kupofried was greatly dismayed.
    How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?${prompt}
  10750: In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.${prompt}
  10751: “Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo,” he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.${prompt}
  10752: |-
    Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin.
    A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?${prompt}
  10753: |-
    We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition.
    We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!${prompt}
