    Nothing.${prompt}
  8: Hmm...not much work for those wet behind the ears, but...${prompt}

  10: If you're to take the mission, I'll be happy to explain.${prompt}
  11: |-
    Interested?
    ${selection-lines}
    Tell me more.
    Never mind.${prompt}
  12: Here's your mission. Orcish scouts roam outside; kill one and bring me his axe as proof.${prompt}
  13: 'You''ll have to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. No other kind will do. Understand?${prompt}'
  14: That is all. You'll take the mission then?${prompt}

    Do you accept the mission?
    ${selection-lines}
    I accept.
    Could you explain again?
    No, thank you.${prompt}
  16: Bring me one of those axes, and your mission will be a success. No running away now; we've a proud country to defend!${prompt}
  17: Oh, you're back. Well, if you're so happy you defeated an Orc or two, you've a long way ahead of you!${prompt}
  18: 'That''s another ${item-singular: 0[2]} for the armory, then. Mission complete! Not bad for a new recruit.${prompt}'
  19: What? I don't want this!${prompt}
  20: Are you really a new recruit!?${prompt}
  21: Listen, before you bring me something, you must first accept the mission! That is how things work around here!${prompt}
  22: Persistent, aren't you? An Orc under the belt does not a hero make! Ah, I've just the job for you...${prompt}
  23: Bat patrol! How about it? Shouldn't be a problem for an adventurer such as yourself, no?${prompt}
  24: Here's your mission, then. Clear out bats lurking in King Ranperre's Tomb and bring me a fang as proof.${prompt}
  25: 'Bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and your mission will be a success.${prompt}'
  26: Deep in the tomb you'll find Goblins. Take care; I don't want to lose you yet.${prompt}
  27: Ah, you've returned! I was afraid that Goblins got you.${prompt}
  28: 'That''s one ${item-singular: 3[2]} for the gatehouse, then. Mission complete. Not bad for a new recruit.${prompt}'
  29: Ah, the recruit's back again? I'm sorry, but I've no time for you today.${prompt}
  30: Well, perhaps you can be of some help. Many of our children have disappeared mysteriously, and I've no doubt the Ghelsba Orcs are behind it.${prompt}
  31: The Royal Knights should be on the job by now, but the two princes are at each other's throats.${prompt}
  32: Prince Trion, the eldest, says we should launch a full attack, with all haste.${prompt}
  33: While his younger brother, Prince Pieuje says the safety of the children comes first, and he won't authorize an attack.${prompt}
  34: They've been arguing this back and forth for days. The knights' hands are tied, and frankly, nobody knows what to do.${prompt}
  35: If you really want to make a name for yourself, go to Ghelsba, and rescue those kidnapped children!${prompt}
  36: What say you? Will you go?${prompt}
  37: Here's your mission, then. Rescue the two children kidnapped by the Orcs of Ghelsba Outpost.${prompt}
  38: Ghelsba Outpost is northwest of West Ronfaure. Take the path before the Westgate, then turn right when the path splits in the forest. You'll find the entrance up in the hills.${prompt}
  39: If you have trouble finding the way, just follow one of the soldiers on patrol.${prompt}
  40: Orcs tend to keep their hostages in tents or small huts. Once you're inside the compound, check them first.${prompt}
  41: Ah, you've returned! You were gone so long, I feared a warmachine had got you!${prompt}
  42: At any rate, mission complete! And to reward your accomplishment...${prompt}
  43: I hereby recognize you, ${name-player}, as a certified adventurer of San d'Oria! You're now mission rank two, as well.${prompt}
  44: But don't get too excited. Your title is valid only here in San d'Oria, understand?${prompt}
  45: 'In order to become a true adventurer, and bear ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you must be recognized by Bastok and Windurst as well.${prompt}'
  46: '''Tis a treaty between the three lands, and its word is law. I know it''s hard, but those are the rules.${prompt}'
  47: For now, cut your adventuring teeth in the areas near here. Sooner or later you'll find your way into other lands.${prompt}
  48: You achieve rank 2!${prompt}
  49: There's not much work in right now. I suppose you could go participate in the Temple Knights' rescue drills out on the La Theine Plateau.${prompt}
  50: Enter the forest beyond the Westgate and head southwest. You'll come out onto the La Theine Plateau before long.${prompt}
  51: Once you're out on the plateau, keep going until you see the knights. The training grounds aren't far from there.${prompt}
  52: It's all just a drill, so this should be easy compared to your usual fare. Just follow orders and you'll be fine.${prompt}
  53: You've returned! I hear the drill turned into something far more perilous. But real battle is the best drill for recruits, in my opinion.${prompt}
  54: Regardless, you've done well. I'll turn to you when there's work to be done, now.${prompt}
  55: 'Here, take this ${item-singular: 3[2]}. Go ahead, you''ve earned it.${prompt}'
  56: This time it's messenger duty. One of our knights is out scouting in a place called Davoi, on the southern edge of Jugner Forest.${prompt}
  57: The Orcs' stronghold is in Davoi, so it's vital that we stop them from massing, or they may launch an assault.${prompt}
  58: Of course, the Orcs are keeping an eye on us, too. Why, just a few days past, a squad of our Royal Knights fell to their axes.${prompt}
  59: We have sent scouts to find a weakness in their defenses. You must find the scout there now, and bring back the latest scouting report.${prompt}
  60: The scout's name is Zantaviat. He's somewhere in Davoi, but where I cannot say.${prompt}
  61: Come back after you've gotten the report. Those lands are no place to wander.${prompt}
  62: You have returned! And you've brought the scouting report. Good work, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  63: Troubling news, this is. It says that Orcs are gathering deep inside the encampment. The time to act is coming!${prompt}
  64: But that is not your concern. You've done well today. Mission complete!${prompt}
  65: Oh, it's you, ${name-player}. And at just the right time, too. Monarlais Halver is looking for an adventurer such as yourself.${prompt}
  66: Enter Chateau d'Oraguille. Monarlais Halver is there; he'll explain in person.${prompt}
  67: What? You haven't been certified in Bastok and Windurst yet? You may dally, but others are not! Get moving!${prompt}
  68: Ah, welcome back. I see you've been certified in Bastok and Windurst. Good work. You'll make a fine adventurer.${prompt}
  69: What's that, a report for our kingdom? I see. Take that to the monarlais when you go.${prompt}
  70: 'You should receive ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} from Monarlais Halver. Now, go to Chateau d''Oraguille and let them know you''re back!${prompt}'
  71: Hurry to Chateau d'Oraguille and give that report to Monarlais Halver!${prompt}
  72: You achieve rank 3!${prompt}
  73: Ah! You've come at just the right time. Zantaviat, one of our scouts in Davoi, needs an adventurer.${prompt}
  74: He wants someone to infiltrate Davoi and scout behind enemy lines. Know anyone fitting that description?${prompt}
  75: 'Now that you''ve got your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, this is an opportunity to prove you''re worth it!${prompt}'
  76: The situation in Davoi worsens by the day. This won't be easy, but I can't think of a better adventurer for the job!${prompt}
  77: You've returned! Zantaviat told me everything. Congratulations on a job well done!${prompt}
  78: But we can't let down our guard yet. Those Orcs will not just sit there. We must keep constant vigil, and move before they do!${prompt}
  79: 'Here''s your reward: ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. You''re becoming quite the adventurer, aren''t you?${prompt}'
  80: Welcome back! I have an important mission for you this time. Recently, land is eroding due to crystal formation...and it's getting worse.${prompt}
  81: There's a small spring on the eastern edge of Jugner Forest, called Crystwater Spring. We must know what effect crystal formation has on the wildlife there.${prompt}
  82: 'I want you to get me a fish from the spring. And not just any fish! You need to get ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  83: Ah, that reminds me--have you any fishing gear? You'll need some for this mission.${prompt}
  84: There are people about that know a thing or two about fishing, should you need help finding and choosing your gear.${prompt}
  85: Ah, the great angler returns! I was worried, to be honest. All you hear these days is the massing of beasts, the erosion of the Crystal Lines, and now...${prompt}
  86: '...rumors that the Shadow Lord himself has returned!${prompt}'
  87: We will examine the fish you brought. Depending on the results, we may need to act! I'll let you know if we need your help.${prompt}
  88: Ah, it's you, ${name-player}. You've come at a good time. I've news for you.${prompt}
  89: By order of the Kingdom of San d'Oria, you're to head to Jeuno as an ambassadorial attaché.${prompt}
  90: Go to Chateau d'Oraguille. Monarlais Halver will tell you all you need to know.${prompt}

  99: There you are! I've been looking for you. Monarlais Halver requests your presence at the chateau immediately.${prompt}
  100: It sounds as if this is a fairly important mission. I need not remind you that you should take care to properly equip yourself before embarking on this journey.${prompt}
  101: I'm not sure what it's about, but you'd best make haste. The monarlais is not to be kept waiting!${prompt}
  102: Why, if it isn't ${name-player}! This is no time for loafing around, friend! Prince Trion is looking for you.${prompt}
  103: For this next mission, he's requested you personally. You should be honored!${prompt}
  104: As for the details of the mission, I've no idea what he wants, but he was in a hurry. You'd best be off to Chateau d'Oraguille!${prompt}
  105: It is a great thing you've done, ${name-player}! I knew deep in my heart that you were the one for the task.${prompt}
  106: You'd better get to the chateau quick. They're all waiting to welcome you back, I'd wager.${prompt}
  107: You've saved our proud Kingdom of San d'Oria. No, you're the savior of all Vana'diel! There's not a soul that doesn't owe you a great debt, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  108: |-
    Ah, if it isn't ${name-player}!
    You had best hurry off to Chateau d'Oraguille. It seems as if something terrible is in the works there.${prompt}
  109: |-
    Well, if it isn't ${name-player}!
    Your timing is perfect. The chateau just sent a request for an adventurer.${prompt}
  110: It looks as if this next mission has something to do with the late queen. You should feel honored. It's not every day that an adventurer gets to work directly with the royal family.${prompt}
  111: |-
    Spoken like a true San d'Orian!
    Now hurry off to Chateau d'Oraguille and get the details on the mission from Monarlais Halver.${prompt}
  112: What's wrong? Dealing with royalty is not your cup of tea? Well, think about it and come back when you've come to your senses.${prompt}
  113: Prince Trion is requesting the aid of an adventurer. How about it?${prompt}
  114: It looks fairly urgent, so you should hurry to the chateau. The prince is waiting in his chambers.${prompt}
  115: I expected more from you, ${name-player}. If you change your mind, return here. I'll be waiting.${prompt}
  116: I have received the details of your mission from Prince Trion. I will deliver this book to the scholars for deciphering.${prompt}
  117: 'The deciphering of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will take a considerable amount of time. Return later for a report.${prompt}'
  118: 'You handed the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} over to the guard.${prompt}'
  119: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}. We've been waiting.
    Prince Trion is calling for you. I wonder if this means the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has been completely deciphered.${prompt}
  120: Well done, ${name-player}! I knew you would not let the Kingdom down.${prompt}
  121: I'm proud to increase your rank to 7!${prompt}
  122: The papsque has work for you, ${name-player}. Are you willing to take on the task?${prompt}
  123: Excellent. Proceed to the papsque's chambers on the third floor of the cathedral.${prompt}
  124: The papsque often comes across as a difficult man, but he is actually very kindhearted and compassionate. If you change your mind, I'll be waiting here.${prompt}
  125: The fair Claidie I d'Oraguille has invited you to the chateau. She wishes for you to see the flowers that have bloomed from the seeds you brought back from Altepa.${prompt}
  126: It is an honor to be invited to the chateau garden. One day you may even have the opportunity to attend one of their royal garden parties.${prompt}
  127: We cannot keep the princess waiting. Now, off to the chateau!${prompt}
  128: A party of Royal Knights stationed in Ghelsba Outpost have reported strange activity by Orcs deep within Yughott Grotto.${prompt}
  129: From your reports, we already know that the beastmen have built a giant portal, but their motives remain unclear.${prompt}
  130: It makes me shudder to think of what those Orcs are planning with that portal...${prompt}
  131: ${name-player}, your next mission is to travel to Ghelsba and continue your investigation into the Orcs' activities.${prompt}
  132: Be on your guard when traveling deep into Yughott Grotto. Losing an adventurer such as yourself would deal a great blow to all of San d'Oria.${prompt}
  133: I see you need more time for preparations. When you are ready, I'll be waiting.${prompt}
  134: It's hard to believe Orcs have their hands on such dangerous equipment. More patrols will have to be sent out to prevent any new developments in their evil plans.${prompt}
  135: 'And this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}... We will have to analyze it and begin reproduction for our forces. We cannot let Orcs get the Treasure of the Dragon King before San d''Oria does.${prompt}'
  136: Well, congratulations on the completion of your mission. Hmmm? Do I know of an adventurer named Eideialc? Never heard of him.${prompt}
  137: But you need not worry about some petty traveler. You are in a different league. You are now rank 8!${prompt}
  138: Princess Claidie's coming-of-age ceremony is drawing near. This ceremony is an important facet of d'Oraguille tradition.${prompt}
  139: Monarlais Halver has put out a call to high-ranking adventurers for their assistance in Chateau d'Oraguille.${prompt}
  140: Ah, the young princess has finally become a lady... Oh, I'm sorry. You can get the details of your next mission from Sir Halver.${prompt}
  141: What? You do not wish to repay the kindness the princess has shown to you in the past months? As you wish...but if you change your mind, you know where to find me.${prompt}
  142: I am busy with preparations for Princess Claidie's coming-of-age ceremony. You don't know what kind of vermin could be roaming the streets and looking for trouble.${prompt}
  143: Princess Claidie's coming-of-age ceremony is about to begin at the cathedral. I must remain at my post, but why don't you attend?${prompt}
  144: The king has requested your audience. He has selected you from the mountain of adventurers in San d'Oria. You should feel honored!${prompt}
  145: You have matured from a fledgling adventurer into a great asset to our kingdom. Do not let us down.${prompt}
  146: There is no need for modesty at a time like this. The fate of San d'Oria is at stake!${prompt}
  147: The authorities are saying that a dark cloud of despair is looming over the Kingdom. They are asking for the assistance of only the best adventurers.${prompt}
  148: I can think of none more qualified than you. Will you accept this mission?${prompt}
  149: |-
    Then proceed to the Audience Chamber in the Chateau d'Oraguille.
    Word has it that His Highness is not feeling that well. He may not be present for your briefing.${prompt}
  150: ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}! The Kingdom is counting on you. Who else, I ask you, is worthy for this task?${prompt}
  151: Ah, a time of great change is upon us. In a matter of days, the Rites of Succession will be held at the cathedral in Northern San d'Oria. It is then that the new heir to the throne will be decided.${prompt}
  152: Due to the unpredictable circumstances that took place at the princess's coming-of-age ceremony, this time, only authorized personnel will be allowed near the proceedings. However, the royal family has requested your services as a guard.${prompt}
  153: Even we Royal Knights have not been granted permission to attend... You must be held in high regard by His Highness. I envy you, ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Ma'am].${prompt}
  154: When you have finished your preparations, proceed directly to the cathedral to report.${prompt}
  155: Off the record, which of the two princes do you think should be the next heir to the throne?${prompt}
  156: |-
    It is a difficult decision, but...
    ${selection-lines}
    Trion is better suited.
    Pieuje is better suited.${prompt}
  157: |-
    Hm...
    Being the oldest, he is the true heir, and many people believe he is the most suited to rule the Kingdom. However, Prince Pieuje's prudent ways may be what this country is lacking.${prompt}
  158: Many think as you do, ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}. However, what this country may need is someone who will not back down in the face of a threat--someone who will stand up for the pride of the Kingdom.${prompt}
  159: But our opinion is of no matter. Lightbringer will decide who is the most suited to stand over our fine nation. And do not speak a word of today's exchange, for the monarlais will have our heads if he finds out.${prompt}
  160: I realize that you must have many preparations before taking on such an important mission. Take your time and return here when you are ready.${prompt}

  6698: I am sure nothing will come of this, but in case they do find something in that wasteland, do not let them take it. Understood?${prompt}
  6699: As you command, my lord. I would give the very blood that runs in my veins if it were to further the cause of our kingdom. You can rely on me.${prompt}
  6700: These foreigners are wily and faithless. Never let down your guard, and may the Goddess of the Dawn protect you in Her mercy.${prompt}

  6710: What do I know about the late queen? I see. You'd like to do your homework before diving into this mission.${prompt}
  6711: Well, Queen Leaute I d'Oraguille was originally the Princess of Tavnazia. She married into the d'Oraguille family before the Great War.${prompt}
  6712: Known for her exquisite beauty, there wasn't a man in San d'Oria who wouldn't have given his right arm to spend a moment alone with her...including myself!${prompt}
  6713: But, as you know, Tavnazia was left obliterated after the Great War. One could tell that this troubled the queen, but she would never show her pain in public.${prompt}
  6714: If Tavnazia had survived ruin, Marquis Altedour's son--namely, Queen Leaute's younger brother--would have succeeded to the throne. However, after the war, her brother disappeared.${prompt}

  6746: As you may have already realized, the current tomb is a new one, built many years after the king passed away.${prompt}
  6747: The location of the true tomb was lost during the Great War. This loss has haunted San d'Oria for the past twenty years.${prompt}
  6748: Finding the location of the true tomb is critical in locating the lost Treasure, as well as in boosting the Kingdom's morale.${prompt}

    You are right, Chalvatot.
    ${name-player}, I apologize for my words. Please, stay and enjoy the beauty of the dreamroses.${prompt}
  6787: Dear Mother... My coming-of-age ceremony is drawing near. My brothers tell me that during the ceremony I will be informed of all the secrets of the d'Oraguille family.${prompt}
  6788: I have heard that the same tradition was carried out in Tavnazia. Mother, what secrets were revealed to you? Will I be able to handle the burden as you did?${prompt}
  6789: I beg of you, Mother. Watch over me in these trying times.${prompt}
  6790: ${name-player}, I assume an adventurer of your stature has heard the rumors of Princess Claidie's coming-of-age ceremony.${prompt}
  6791: This ceremony is a piece of d'Oraguille tradition and requires much preparation. This is where your assistance is necessary.${prompt}
  6792: 'Travel to the Fountain of Kings located within the Quicksand Caves, and bring back ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  6793: The princess is always speaking of your deeds for the Kingdom. Everyone here is counting on you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  6794: 'Travel to the Fountain of Kings located within the Quicksand Caves, and bring back ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}. The princess is counting on you, ${name-player}.${prompt}'
  6795: So, my younger sister has finally come of age... I remember when my brother and I would sneak out of the chateau and search the city for presents to buy her.${prompt}
  6796: We would always be awed by the wonders of the city.${prompt}
  6797: One year, the king caught us sneaking out. Our mother tried talking to our father, but there was no easing his anger. It was then that I first feared my father.${prompt}
  6798: Our mother fell ill shortly after, and there was nothing my brother or I could do to save her. Maybe it was our lack of power to save our mother that made us enemies...${prompt}
  6799: I apologize for my rambling. Perhaps I should journey out into the city and select my sister's gift...${prompt}
  6800: |-
    Claidie has finally come of age...
    My sister and I don't have many memories of the queen, but every time I see Claidie, I can sense a part of my mother in her.${prompt}
  6801: I don't know... It's probably because they look and act so alike.${prompt}
  6802: Despite being raised without a mother alongside two older brothers, she has matured into a fine, beautiful woman. Now is her time to shine.${prompt}
  6803: 'Ah, ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. These were used during the princes'' ceremonies as well.${prompt}'
  6804: Tradition prohibits us from allowing you to attend the ceremony, but feel free to view it. The princess would be delighted at your presence.${prompt}
  6805: Call forth all members of the court. Has the adventurer ${name-player} arrived?${prompt}
  6806: Ah, ${name-player}. The deciphering of the stone tablet you found has been completed.${prompt}
  6807: There is one line that has us especially intrigued...${prompt}
  6808: “Light will befall the great Vana'diel only when the true heir of d'Oraguille raises Lightbringer to the heavens.”${prompt}
  6809: And this means...${prompt}
  6810: It means that only the true heir to the d'Oraguille throne will be able to unsheathe Lightbringer, and that only when he does will the true power of the sword be unleashed.${prompt}
  6811: Then it is decided. When we have possession of the legendary sword, Trion and Pieuje will both attempt to unsheathe it.${prompt}
  6812: Whoever succeeds will take my place on the throne as the true heir to the House of d'Oraguille.${prompt}
  6813: '!!!${prompt}'
  6814: The true...heir?${prompt}
  6815: Trion or Pieuje--the sword will decide the future of San d'Oria and lead us from the darkness. Of course, we must first locate the Treasure of the Dragon King.${prompt}
  6816: |-
    Rahal. Curilla.
    I want your knights to concentrate their efforts on locating Lightbringer.${prompt}
  6817: Yes, Your Highness.${prompt}
  6818: Understood, Your Highness.${prompt}
  6819: |-
    And ${name-player}.
    Report to Rahal for your orders. I trust that your involvement in this investigation can only benefit San d'Oria.${prompt}
  6820: Set forth and search the darkness for the light that will guide us to a brighter future. The dawn of a new era in San d'Oria is upon us!${prompt}
  6821: ${name-player}, I want you to investigate the Temple of Uggalepih.${prompt}
  6822: 'Take this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} with you on your journey.${prompt}'
  6823: 'Use it when searching the area. Any response from the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} may be a clue to the location of Lightbringer. The fate of the Kingdom is riding on your shoulders. Don''t let us down!${prompt}'
  6824: Remember, this mission is a matter of national security. When you have finished your investigation, make your report directly to the king.${prompt}
  6825: I have been assigned to the investigation of a remote island off the west of the Vollbow coast. This will be the first time I have left San d'Oria since I was a knight in training.${prompt}
  6826: |-
    So you were unable to locate Lightbringer...
    Well, to our surprise, Curilla's expeditionary forces returned yesterday with the sword.${prompt}
  6827: Welcome back from your long journey, ${name-player}. I am pleased to report that Curilla's forces located the holy sword, Lightbringer.${prompt}
  6828: According to the writings in our ancient tomes, the scholars feel that the retrieved sword is truly the lost Treasure of the Dragon King.${prompt}
  6829: The path leading to this day has been long and treacherous. However, our journey is nearly complete. I do not have the words to express my gratitude for your services.${prompt}
  6830: I thank you, and wish that you might continue your work for the good of San d'Oria long after I have stepped down from the throne.${prompt}
  6831: However, one final ceremony must be held--the true heir to the House of d'Oraguille must be decided. At that time, your service will again be called upon.${prompt}
  6832: We located Lightbringer on a small, remote island off the coast of Vollbow.${prompt}
  6833: Once a part of Vollbow, the island was ripped away from the mainland by the force of the beastmen's terrible weapons. Now the area is nothing but a wasteland.${prompt}
  6834: When I took the sword up in my hands, I could feel something running through it. At that moment, I knew I was holding the true sword of King Ranperre.${prompt}
  6835: To tell you the truth, I had my doubts about the Treasure of the Dragon King, but Curilla managed to find it. Still, I am vexed by this--why was the sword on that island?${prompt}
  6836: Lightbringer has been found! This is the happiest day in my tenure as monarlais!${prompt}
  6837: Thanks to your perseverance and commitment to the Kingdom, Lightbringer has been found, and now the Rites of Succession can be carried out.${prompt}
  6838: As long as the Treasure is in San d'Oria, the Kingdom will be safe--regardless of whether myself or my brother is the true heir to the throne.${prompt}
  6839: The Rites of Succession will be carried out soon. At that time, your services will once again be called upon.${prompt}
  6840: I never imagined myself becoming king. This kingdom needs the leadership of my brother to bring her together.${prompt}
  6841: But she also needs someone to step in and take control when my brother has gone too far.${prompt}
  6842: If by chance Lightbringer selects me, I do not know if I can prevent San d'Oria's bloody history from repeating itself.${prompt}
  6843: Does the Treasure of the Dragon King truly wield the power to rule a kingdom? Are we not reading too much into legend? Only time will bring an answer to my fears.${prompt}
  6844: Oh, it's you. How goes it with your wyvern?${prompt}
  6845: |-
    How goes it?
    ${selection-lines}
    We are steadfast companions.
    Not as well as I would like.${prompt}
  6846: Excellent. I never doubted your success.${prompt}
  6847: I see... However, if you continue to shower it with attention, your wyvern will come around eventually. They thrive on affection.${prompt}
  6848: On a more serious note, the Royal Knights have recently become the target of a number of attacks by an unknown assailant. It is humiliating for the defenders of the Kingdom to be in this position in the first place, but the situation is more grave than a simple loss of face.${prompt}
  6849: There is a rumor circulating among the knights that these attacks are being carried out by Erpalacion, the last dragoon. It has the men unnerved.${prompt}
  6850: As I am sure you are aware, Erpalacion was the general of the knights during the rule of King Ranperre, and the only dragoon in existence at the time.${prompt}
  6851: 'Historians all agree on this point: Without the strength of Erpalacion, many great achievements would have been beyond King Ranperre''s reach.${prompt}'
  6852: Erpalacion has joined the ranks of the fallen, so there is no possible way he could be responsible for these attacks. But the fears of the knights have some validity. There is a tale told of Erpalacion...${prompt}
  6853: Immediately after King Ranperre had quelled the strife within the Kingdom, Erpalacion was sent by the king's orders on an expedition to the Outlands.${prompt}
  6854: It is widely said that this expedition served no strategic significance, and that King Ranperre merely feared the power of Erpalacion.${prompt}
  6855: |-
    He was never heard from again.
    King Ranperre apparently nodded in satisfaction when hearing the report from the returning soldiers...${prompt}
  6856: |-
    I do not believe this story.
    Even if there is some truth to the tale, there is unlikely to be a reappearance of the last dragoon.
    ...However, I have no evidence to support my views.${prompt}
  6857: |-
    I wish to assign you the task of gathering information on the attacks against the Royal Knights.
    The true culprit must be brought to justice. What say you?${prompt}
  6858: |-
    I have a task for you.
    I wish you to gather information on the true culprit behind these attacks. Considering your profession, surely you wish to dispel these rumors that sully the honor of your fellow dragoon.${prompt}
  6859: |-
    What say you?
    ${selection-lines}
    Leave it to me.
    Other duties call me.${prompt}
  6860: Empty suits of armor...?${prompt}

    These are nothing more than stumbling puppets!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}

    It must be the ghost of the last dragoon, come to wreak his vengeance...${prompt}
  6864: Mind your tongue, Aramaviont. You stand on castle grounds.${prompt}
  6865: Yes, sir. My apologies.${prompt}
  6866: |-
    These empty shells will not rise again.
    Clear these away, and not a word to anyone of this.${prompt}
  6867: 'Yes, sir!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  6868: |-
    We must get to the bottom of this matter.
    Have you noticed anything strange these past few days?${prompt}
  6869: |-
    Someone tried to steal the brais of the last dragoon...?
    Well, that certainly qualifies. Start your investigation from there.${prompt}
  6870: You might try asking for information from the people at the Brugaire Consortium.${prompt}
  6871: I concede that this is a problem that only concerns the knights... However, I feel that someone outside our ranks, with some distance from events, has a better chance to grasp the whole picture. Tell me if you have a change of heart.${prompt}
  6872: |-
    The people at the Brugaire Consortium may have information concerning the brais of the last dragoon.
    I doubt they would agree with me, but the merchants there owe me a favor.${prompt}
  6873: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 7[2]}!
    This handwriting...
    That's what this is all about!
    ...You must talk with Sir Balasiel on this matter.${prompt}
  6874: |-
    I cannot speak of it...
    Or rather, I do not wish to speak of it...${prompt}
  6875: |-
    You must take this matter to Sir Balasiel.
    I cannot speak of it...
    Or rather, I do not wish to speak of it...${prompt}
  6876: "Ancolain was a powerful warrior, but he lacked self-control.\nI bode my time until his return to the ranks... \nBut never did I imagine things would come to this.${prompt}"
  6877: So you learned from Sir Balasiel that your wyvern can sense Ancolain's location...based on the shadow of the thoughts that still cling to the letter. I only hope that he hasn't dabbled in any of the black arts that are practiced by those savages to the south.${prompt}
  6878: The misunderstanding that long surrounded King Ranperre and the last dragoon has now been cleared--and with it, the chaos that threatened the stability of the knights. You have my thanks.${prompt}

  7050: 'But know you this: our Kingdom of San d''Oria has no intention of showing a friendly facade to either Bastok or Windurst.${prompt}'
  7051: How you classless mobs could ever think to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Elvaan is, frankly, beyond me.${prompt}
  7052: Yet on you come--impertinent stuttering shrimps, lumbering ore-heads, purring fur-balls! It's simply unacceptable.${prompt}
  7053: But, enough of that...${prompt}
  7054: 'Here is your mission: infiltrate Ghelsba Outpost, northwest of San d''Oria.${prompt}'
  7055: In the middle of the Ghelsba camps is a place called the highland encampment. We want you to defeat the camp head, a “Warchief Vatgit.”${prompt}
  7056: You'll find the encampment a little ways into Ghelsba. Go in, cross the river, and you'll see the camps up on a ridge to the east.${prompt}
  7057: When you've finished, if you aren't Orc fodder, report back to your own consulate. We don't take kindly to foreigners loitering around the chateau, if you get my meaning.${prompt}
  7058: The Orcs aren't so much of a problem that the Kingdom need worry about sending out knights. Let the adventurers clean them up for pocket change--that is our policy.${prompt}
  7059: Don't make me repeat myself. Get going.${prompt}
  7060: Congratulations, but don't expect anything from us. Our policy towards Windurstians and Bastokers can be summarized as “detached cooperation,” you see.${prompt}
  7061: An adventurer from Bastok, are you? Consul Helaku sent word about you. You look able, that's for sure.${prompt}
  7062: An adventurer from Windurst, are you? Consul Kasaroro sent word about you. You look able, that's for sure.${prompt}
  7063: Well, you may never reach the glory of the Royal Knights, but do good work, and you'll be rewarded accordingly.${prompt}
  7064: Here is our dilemma. The Orcs have set up a front-line base of operations in a place called Ghelsba Outpost, northwest of San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7065: You're familiar with the Quadav, no? Well, Orcs are just like them. A vicious and barbaric race, and quite stupid to boot.${prompt}
  7066: You're familiar with the Yagudo, no? Well, Orcs are just like them. A vicious and barbaric race, and quite stupid to boot.${prompt}
  7067: The problem is, those Orcs have been showing signs of intelligence lately. They've started using ranged weapons...even machines of war!${prompt}
  7068: Our investigations indicate that someone is behind the Orcs, supplying them with weapons.${prompt}
  7069: We want you to find a cavern deep in Ghelsba Outpost--a place called Yughott Grotto.${prompt}
  7070: We've sent many an adventurer to Yughott Grotto, but few have returned, and we are desperate for knowledge.${prompt}
  7071: There may be some...danger involved, but if you provide us with useful information, formal recognition from the Kingdom of San d'Oria will be yours.${prompt}
  7072: I'm a little busy here. Report to your country's San d'Orian consulate when you've completed this mission.${prompt}
  7073: Well, ${name-player}, it's good to see you again. Let's see the report you've brought back, then!${prompt}
  7074: The Shadow Lord...back!? That's impossible! He was slain by our forces in the Great War twenty years ago...${prompt}
  7075: What!? The nether beasts have broken out into this land? This is dire news, indeed!${prompt}
  7076: If this report is true, we must take action.${prompt}
  7077: Hmm...but, to be honest, I find it hard to believe.${prompt}
  7078: 'Very well. I will take this report. You will be issued ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}, as promised.${prompt}'
  7079: Your latest accomplishment raises your mission rank to 3. Congratulations.${prompt}
  7080: You must be weary. Be at ease in this chateau. There is much here to soothe the mind and warm the spirit.${prompt}
  7081: I've been waiting for you, ${name-player}. As you've probably already heard from the gatehouse, you are to report to the Embassy of San d'Oria at Jeuno.${prompt}
  7082: Our relations with Jeuno are vital to maintaining the balance of power between our Kingdom of San d'Oria, Windurst, and Bastok.${prompt}
  7083: You will receive your letter of introduction to Jeuno from His Majesty Royaulais Destin himself. Great honor this is!${prompt}
  7084: Proceed through the door to the audience chamber. The king is waiting for you. Remember to mind protocol!${prompt}
  7085: You have been granted an audience with the king.${prompt}
  7086: You audience with the king is finished.${prompt}
  7087: What is the matter? Do not keep the king waiting!${prompt}
  7088: Welcome, ${name-player}. I am Destin, King of San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7089: Please, be at ease. I've heard of you from Claidie. Much have you done for the Kingdom, it seems!${prompt}
  7090: As I'm sure Lord Halver has told you, we decided to appoint you to serve in the Embassy of San d'Oria at Jeuno.${prompt}
  7091: Recently we lost one of our staff there. But do not be alarmed, for you shall serve under my direct appointment.${prompt}
  7092: Take that letter of introduction with you and depart for Jeuno.${prompt}
  7093: The embassy has been informed, and is expecting you. Show the letter to any of the staff there.${prompt}
  7094: Depart as soon as you are able.${prompt}
  7095: 'Safe journeys, ${name-player}.${wait-animation: 2}${prompt}'
  7096: Get to Jeuno, and take that letter of introduction with you. Ambassador Jima is anxious to see you!${prompt}
  7097: Hello, ${name-player}. You've rushed back from Jeuno upon hearing the news, right? Well, we've taken care of those bandits already.${prompt}
  7098: Well, Halver is exaggerating again, with talk of a botched assassination. What could he mean by the king falling unconscious? Surely he is not calling adventurers to the chateau over such nonsense!${prompt}
  7099: Such brigands cannot stand before the might of the Temple Knights! His whisperings dishonor our nation. Do you not agree?${prompt}
  7100: Curilla? Are you there?${prompt}
  7101: Yes, Your Majesty!${prompt}
  7102: Ah, very good. Your leadership was exemplary, as always. Thanks to you, I may focus on my duties.${prompt}
  7103: You are too kind, Your Majesty.${prompt}
  7104: However, Curilla, there seems to be something you overlooked.${prompt}
  7105: Your Majesty?${prompt}
  7106: During the uproar, somebody made off with the talisman!${prompt}
  7107: The talisman, Your Majesty? Not the one that keeps the Shadow Lord imprisoned!${prompt}
  7108: The very one. We were visited by an infiltrator while our eyes were on the brigands.${prompt}
  7109: So, the intruders were but a decoy...${prompt}
  7110: I suspected them so.${prompt}
  7111: And who might know of the talisman's existence, even among San d'Orians? Your Majesty, I fear someone bent on bringing the Shadow Lord back from his exile did this!${prompt}
  7112: But before we track down this infiltrator, first must we thwart their sinister plot. Halver, let us decide on a plan of action.${prompt}
  7113: Curilla, be not disheartened; by no means was this your fault. Call off the alert, and return to your regular duties.${prompt}
  7114: Well, ${name-player}, your help is needed yet again. Halver will convey my orders soon enough... Remember, you have our thanks!${prompt}
  7115: We shall begin immediate discussion on a policy for action. ${name-player}, you must work on improving your skills and equipment.${prompt}
  7116: Speak naught of the attempt on the king's life, nor of this business with the Shadow Lord, lest panic grip the Kingdom!${prompt}
  7117: We've come to a decision at last, ${name-player}. We will send an expedition to the accursed Northlands.${prompt}
  7118: It will go to the ancient ruins of Fei'Yin, northeast of the Beaucedine Glacier. Of course, you'll be going, too.${prompt}
  7119: The ruins are those of a city built by an ancient civilization that we believe was more advanced than our own.${prompt}
  7120: The race that lived there called themselves the Zilart. We have found similar ruins on Cape Teriggan to the south.${prompt}
  7121: Amazingly they both remain, though they were built long ago. It is as if some unseen force defies time to protect them.${prompt}
  7122: Once, thirty years ago, an international expedition was sent to the Northlands. They were to uncover the secret of the Zilart's power.${prompt}
  7123: They returned empty-handed. We need you to head to the Beaucedine Glacier and scour the ruins of Fei'Yin yourself.${prompt}
  7124: The ruins are overrun with fiends, you know. We captured it from the Shadow Lord twenty years ago at the cost of many lives.${prompt}
  7125: We set a seal on the ruined coliseum to strengthen the barrier of the Northlands from the inside.${prompt}
  7126: You must find it, and use this new seal to strengthen its magic if necessary.${prompt}
  7127: Yes, I'm concerned about the Shadow Lord's return. But if the border falls and the nether beasts pass into our realm, all in this world will fall to ruin.${prompt}
  7128: Of course, you'll be going, too.${prompt}
  7129: Welcome back, ${name-player}. Time is of the essence, as you know, so I'll dispense with formalities. What did you find in Fei'Yin?${prompt}
  7130: So the seal in Fei'Yin was already broken... What will we do, should the nether beasts be brought to battle as they were twenty years ago?${prompt}
  7131: The answer is simple, Halver. We must bring the battle to them!${prompt}
  7132: But, Your Highness, we lack knowledge of our enemy. Though tempting, an attack would be far too dangerous.${prompt}
  7133: An attack would be most effective at this early stage! We need not worry about our forces, either. Plenty of reckless adventurers are willing to fight.${prompt}
  7134: Be not so hasty, Prince Trion.${prompt}
  7135: Curilla! What a pleasant surprise!${prompt}
  7136: Please consider the alliance! We must not move troops beyond our borders without first consulting our allies.${prompt}
  7137: The enemy is upon us! We've no time to chat with foreigners. We must act now!${prompt}
  7138: Forgive me, but how will we explain this, when it was our responsibility, as watchers of the Northlands, to stop our foes before they struck?${prompt}
  7139: It is not our duty to explain to foreigners our kingdom's policies. We should move our forces now, so that no explanation will be needed!${prompt}
  7140: Please, I beg you! Ask Jeuno to gather the three great nations, and establish a unified front!${prompt}
  7141: Silence, Curilla, silence! Since when have you become the weeping dove?${prompt}
  7142: Please, listen to reason, Prince Trion! We have but scarce information on the Shadow Lord's return, and what we do have has been collected by adventurers--it's unreliable at best!${prompt}
  7143: But if the Shadow Lord has come again, then we need the help of the other countries even more!${prompt}
  7144: I have heard enough of your cooing prattle, Curilla! It is clear I can look to no one but myself for decisive leadership!${prompt}
  7145: Where has my dear brother Pieuje has gone off to, and at such a critical time as this?${prompt}
  7146: Cooing...prattle?${prompt}
  7147: With the reconnaissance of Fei'Yin complete, our kingdom must take action quickly. Unfortunately, with circumstances being what they are, I cannot issue orders for your next mission.${prompt}
  7148: I believe it will take some time for us to reach a decision. Your time will come in due course, my friend. Until then, be well.${prompt}
  7149: Political maneuvering, you call it? To think our nation could become this cesspool of manipulation and intrigue...${prompt}
  7150: We have no time for these antics! If they truly are plotting to raise the Shadow Lord, we have not a moment to lose!${prompt}
  7151: Things cannot be allowed to proceed as they are. There must be a way to convince him...${prompt}
  7152: I understand his lordship's fervor, but the risk is too great for us. I believe this requires utmost caution.${prompt}
  7153: Ah, ${name-player}, is it not? Prince Trion was looking for you.${prompt}
  7154: How long do these fools wish to sit here discussing our deaths? We've no time for talk, not anymore.${prompt}
  7155: We must move to stop the return of the Shadow Lord, or war will come upon Vana'diel once again.${prompt}
  7156: ${name-player}, this is an order! Hurry as quickly as you can to Castle Zvahl in the far north, and put an end to this evil scheme of the beastmen!${prompt}
  7157: I will accept all responsibility for this mission. Now, go, brave warrior! For the future of Vana'diel!${prompt}
  7158: Foolishness! He was destroyed in the Great War, twenty years ago! They must have mistaken another fiend for him--that's what has happened, I'm sure of it!${prompt}
  7159: Who is the fool here? If it truly is him, then what? We would be facing far worse than the beastmen rabble then!${prompt}
  7160: Think before you speak, brother! If it is him, then why has he not shown himself these last twenty years?${prompt}
  7161: I'm saying we cannot afford to take that chance! This is more than an internal affair--we need to send an investigation party, immediately!${prompt}
  7162: Welcome, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7163: I am Mistaravant. I have served as head steward of this chateau for many a year.${prompt}
  7164: This is the room of King Destin. No place for the likes of you.${prompt}
  7165: Do not loiter inside the chateau.${prompt}
  7166: What's this? I'll not have miscreants loitering in the chateau or its grounds! Go about your business, or be thrown out, the choice is yours.${prompt}

  7187: This garden be the memorial garden for our late Queen Leaute. She always loved flowers, and so she wanted to be buried here, you see.${prompt}
  7188: You be an adventurer from abroad, no? If you've got a mission from the monarlais, you'd best be on it, quick.${prompt}
  7189: That monarlais don't like dealing with you foreigners much. Come to think of it, neither do I!${prompt}
  7190: I am Rahal S. Lebrart, general of the Royal Knights of San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7191: The Royal Knights are the sword of San d'Oria. Swiftly we strike, and wipe nests of fiends off the face of Vana'diel!${prompt}
  7192: We are a band of warriors, and some of us have been known to be...overzealous. But there's not a dark heart in the bunch of us. You have my word!${prompt}
  7193: I've just returned from Bastok, I have. There be these Quadav living in the mine-holes there!${prompt}
  7194: Bastokers delve for stone and let the Quadav be. But I says we should slay every last one of those shell-backed freaks!${prompt}

  7254: Fei'Yin is to the northeast of Beaucedine Glacier. Be wary on the road, there are many beastmen, and worse, about.${prompt}
  7255: The prince seems...troubled that a decision has not been made on what action to take. Take care not to further ruffle any royal feathers.${prompt}
  7256: Prince Trion went to his chambers a short while ago and has yet to return. You should go speak with him there.${prompt}

  7258: How are things in Jeuno? Remember--you're on a direct mission for our king. Do your best.${prompt}
  7259: I heard you've received a mission directly from the Archduke of Jeuno himself. Remember, you are a San d'Orian and should always act with pride accordingly.${prompt}

  7265: Trion has spoken to me about you. At long last we meet, ${name-player}. I commend you for putting an end to the Shadow Lord.${prompt}
  7266: You have fulfilled my expectations. No, you surpassed them! For that we thank you. May you continue to serve the motherland.${prompt}
  7267: Yes... Thanks to you, the Shadow Lord's return was nipped in the bud. We are all in your debt, especially in light of my elder brother's antics.${prompt}
  7268: Hmph. Ever the complainer, I see.${prompt}
  7269: 'I showed Halver the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} that ${name-player} brought back. He sensed a great negative energy.${prompt}'
  7270: Hmm...${prompt}
  7271: Father, let us not dwell on the petty details! The Shadow Lord is dead, and our greatest threat is no more. We must return our attention to San d'Oria herself.${prompt}
  7272: Of course, our nation has fallen ill. Our long struggle with the beastmen has prevented any recovery from the war.${prompt}
  7273: Much like the reign of King Ranperre.${prompt}
  7274: Ah, the Dragon King, Ranperre?${prompt}
  7275: Yes, our great ancestor. But that king pulled our kingdom from the brink, and brought San d'Oria again to greatness.${prompt}
  7276: A truly legendary feat.${prompt}
  7277: You speak of the Treasure of the Dragon King?${prompt}
  7278: Yes. The legends speak of King Ranperre and how he used the Treasure to save his nation.${prompt}
  7279: And where may we find...this Treasure?${prompt}
  7280: Hmph. If only we knew! This is all but legend, but apparently the king sealed it away somewhere. I cannot fathom why.${prompt}
  7281: Many were sent looking for it, but none succeeded. Perhaps now is the time we must find it and break the barrier that protects it.${prompt}
  7282: ${name-player}, should you uncover any news of Ranperre's Treasure, report to us at once.${prompt}
  7283: Father, I urge you to send expeditions to every corner of Vana'diel!${prompt}
  7284: Now just a moment, Trion. Why should we wander in darkness when the papsque may still illuminate us?${prompt}
  7285: The papsque, Your Majesty?${prompt}
  7286: Yes. I have faith that soon he will find some clue for us.${prompt}
  7287: My own life is waning. I must solve this mystery while I still breathe!${prompt}

  7422: I wonder, would you take it upon yourself to look into that matter of my father's ghost in the cathedral?${prompt}
  7423: Often would my father visit that place. Perhaps it could be him...${prompt}
  7424: A spirit of a red mage? Are you saying my father has returned? And he called my name!? No... How could this be?${prompt}
  7425: The ghost gave you some old greaves in return for the watch, did he? Well, let me try putting them on.${prompt}
  7426: What? No, of course they're not cursed. You should place more trust in my judgment!${prompt}
  7427: How odd. I cannot don them. I sense something is preventing me from doing so.${prompt}
  7428: Are you there, Curilla?${prompt}
  7429: 'Yes, Prince Trion!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  7430: Oh, a guest. What is all this?${prompt}
  7431: You see, my lord...${prompt}
  7432: What, you have a set of greaves that refuses to be worn? I've heard of that sort of thing before. Yes, they had to be taken to the Crawlers' Nest to be exorcised.${prompt}
  7433: Prince Trion, may I have time to look into this?${prompt}
  7434: I am sorry, Curilla, but you are summoned for service. The papsque has complained that the regions surrounding San d'Oria are patrolled too thinly. We must think of a plan.${prompt}
  7435: Yes, my lord...${prompt}
  7436: I shall await you in my chambers. This is no time to tread through crawlers' lairs, mind you!${prompt}
  7437: Yes...${prompt}
  7438: 'A pity. I say, would you be inclined to take them to the Crawlers'' Nest? They must be buried together with ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in the place where light shines.${prompt}'

  7441: And then come back and tell me how you fared. Even a little information could help solve the puzzle of my father's death.${prompt}
  7442: So the greaves were made for red mages... Perhaps it was my father in the cathedral.${prompt}
  7443: But why that place? Could he be trying to convey something to me? If only I could hear his message.${prompt}

  7449: What? In Fei'Yin you met the ghost of my father, and saw him suffering? The mystery deepens.${prompt}
  7450: You've found my father's remains in Garlaige? My poor father's soul will never rest until his remains are properly interred.${prompt}

    It matters not how my father died...
    Now I know that ever will his memory live on inside me.${prompt}
  7452: You went through great lengths to help me. I have never found it easy to express thanks, but know that I will always be grateful.${prompt}
  7453: Eh? Want to show me your ring, do you? And inscribed upon it are ancient San d'Orian runes? Very well, let us see it.${prompt}
  7454: From whence did you find this? Hmm... The necropolis of Eldieme, you say? So, 'twas true!${prompt}
  7455: Far have you carried this, so I shall tell you the tale. But keep it secret, I beg you!${prompt}
  7456: Ahem! Ages ago, a bard came to San d'Oria. His voice was so stirring that songbirds would pause to listen.${prompt}
  7457: The king was so moved that he sought to keep him here in San d'Oria, if but for a day longer.${prompt}
  7458: The talented bard lingered. But in doing so, he stole the heart of the queen!${prompt}
  7459: You see, her marriage to the king was not for love, and she was many, many years his junior.${prompt}
  7460: But still, always should a queen remain faithful to her husband, don't you think?${prompt}
  7461: Often would the two lovers steal away, to find shelter from prying eyes.${prompt}
  7462: They forged a pair of rings, and promised to each other that they would become one in the next world.${prompt}
  7463: But then, suddenly...${prompt}
  7464: The king got word of her infidelity!${prompt}
  7465: His rage at the liaison between his own queen and his favorite minstrel knew no bounds. The bard was put to death by poison!${prompt}
  7466: But never did the queen forget her lover.${prompt}
  7467: To properly mourn him, she secretly bade my elders craft burial ornaments.${prompt}
  7468: She adorned his corpse with them, and conveyed the remains to Eldieme, and at last interred him there. Unfortunately, grave-robbers later came and ravaged his coffin, and scattered the ornaments in every direction!${prompt}
  7469: Ere long the king passed away.${prompt}
  7470: The queen then left the palace for a convent, where she quietly bode till the end of her days.${prompt}
  7471: Her ring was given to my forefather, and since then it was passed down to me. ${prompt}
  7472: Without a doubt, the ring you hold belonged to her lover, the bard!${prompt}
  7473: I believe that the two rings should be together. Please, could you place them together upon the altar in the Monastic Cavern?${prompt}
  7474: Her Majesty's interred there, and I am sure her spirit would be greatly pleased.${prompt}
  7475: |-
    Take the rings?
    ${selection-lines}
    It's the least I can do.
    I cannot.${prompt}
  7476: At long last Her Majesty's wish shall come true! I suppose it's not proper and all, but my conviction says she would wish it.${prompt}
  7477: Now, place the two rings upon the altar in the Monastic Cavern. I believe in you, friend!${prompt}
  7478: I remain a servant of royalty, you see, so perhaps I behave disloyally. But I would that her final wish come true!${prompt}
  7479: Well, I do believe it best if they were placed together, but the rings are not mine; I'll not order you to!${prompt}
  7480: Take the two rings and place them upon the altar in the Monastic Cavern--the ruins of Her Majesty's convent. Then her wish will at last come true.${prompt}
  7481: Allow me to thank you on behalf of Her Majesty. And, I thank you personally for giving up something of yours!${prompt}
  7482: One of the burial ornaments was entrusted to my care, but I'd rather you have it. It may pale in comparison to the ring, but 'tis all this gardener has to give.${prompt}
  7483: Eh?${prompt}
  7484: Oh... Oh, yes.${prompt}
  7485: Well, good, then. I am sure the queen is pleased.${prompt}
  7486: DUMMY${prompt}
  7487: What is it?${prompt}

  7491: Yes, Prince Trion.${prompt}
  7492: What is your wish, my lord?${prompt}

  7494: No, my lord... Has aught been brought to light since last we spoke?${prompt}
  7495: I am afraid not, Vilbert. Thank you, that is all.${prompt}
  7496: Yes, my lord!${prompt}
  7497: Keep this secret, but a year ago I believed Orcs were aware of the inner workings of this court.${prompt}
  7498: I suspected Chusarlaud was their spy, even more so after his disappearance. I never thought him dead.${prompt}
  7499: I seek an appropriate candidate to look into this, preferably a knight. I would have asked you if only... Oh, never mind.${prompt}
  7500: Would you hearken after his disappearance? This matter requires the objectivity of an outsider.${prompt}
  7501: |-
    Do you accept?
    ${selection-lines}
    With pleasure.
    I humbly refuse.${prompt}

  7504: 'Is that so? Well, I know you shoulder other responsibilities as well. But hear this: There are none else in whom I could entrust this task. Return hither whenever you are able to serve us.${prompt}'

  7508: I see. Earlier, Exoroche requested an audience. His achievements deserve praise indeed!${prompt}

  7532: It seems that the dark stalker spotted in Valkurm was a messenger in life.${prompt}
  7533: The message it carried speaks of Tavnazians slain twenty years ago. They would rise from the grave to restore the Marquisate!${prompt}
  7534: Impossible! How could the dead rally together?${prompt}
  7535: It is true, Prince Pieuje.${prompt}
  7536: Who are you!?${prompt}
  7537: Narcheral sent me on a search through Eldieme. I discovered that the dark stalkers were rallying.${prompt}
  7538: And I heard word that a great black shadow had crept beyond Ranguemont.${prompt}
  7539: The messenger who witnessed it swore it was the lord of Tavnazia, Marquis Altedour.${prompt}
  7540: No! Not Lord Altedour!${prompt}
  7541: It was the Marquis, and at the same time, it was not! It was a presence that deceives the heart and brings fear upon our holy kingdom.${prompt}
  7542: Silence, Narcheral! You dishonor the marquis!${prompt}
  7543: Forgive me, my lord. But, I fear we can avoid the threat no longer. I beg you gather troops!${prompt}
  7544: Jeronne, continue with the investigation. If news comes out of the Northlands, Prince Trion will surely hear.${prompt}
  7545: I understand.${prompt}
  7546: And I have something I wish to discuss with you. Soon we will need the services of an experienced white mage. Seek out a candidate.${prompt}
  7547: So that ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] may fight against the impure, we will accredit the wielder of holy powers by giving ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] an item blessed by Altana.${prompt}

  7554: Brother!${prompt}
  7555: Let me guess. Narcheral sent you to convince me, no?${prompt}
  7556: Know you why Narcheral frets so?${prompt}
  7557: It was twenty years ago that armies of the alliance offered the Marquisate of Tavnazia as bait. The enemy was given false word on where the leaders of Tavnazia would gather.${prompt}
  7558: As hordes of beastmen launched their assault, a daring company of volunteers struck the unguarded gates of the enemy.${prompt}
  7559: There they found and slew the Shadow Lord. But his horde reduced Tavnazia to ash and smoke.${prompt}
  7560: In all likelihood, their lord, Marquis Altedour, never suspected betrayal from his stalwart allies.${prompt}
  7561: The horde had come upon them at night. Valiantly he fought to defend his keep. In the end it fell, and he fled the city. Near the necropolis, though, they caught him!${prompt}
  7562: Though he felled seven hundred of the enemy, there he met his end.${prompt}
  7563: The alliance sent troops to aid in the defense of Tavnazia, but none can deny that it brought ruin upon her.${prompt}
  7564: Marquis Altedour is my... I... What am I to do?${prompt}
  7565: Prince Pieuje, are you there?${prompt}
  7566: Oh, Narcheral... Come in!${prompt}
  7567: Prince Pieuje! I just saw Prince Trion, and he seemed well!${prompt}
  7568: Yes... I'm sure he seems well to your eyes.${prompt}
  7569: Surely Prince Trion will learn of all this, my lord! We will lose this chance to strengthen the influence of our faith!${prompt}
  7570: You mean the cleansing of the damned, and offer them atonement by my hand?${prompt}
  7571: No, my lord! To rid ourselves of the threat of the dead! My lord, the heir to the throne of San d'Oria must not jest of atonement!${prompt}
  7572: I am sorry. I have a plan. I will not allow my brother to deploy troops.${prompt}
  7573: Argh! If this goes on, all will be discovered! Chaos will consume San d'Oria--no, all of Vana'diel!${prompt}
  7574: Narcheral, I have news.${prompt}
  7575: We received word that a dark stalker walks in the guise of Marquis Altedour towards Fei'Yin.${prompt}
  7576: In that place festers also souls of nations beyond Tavnazia. Perhaps there he seeks an army...${prompt}
  7577: An army of the dead!? It is hard to believe, but we'd be fools not to.${prompt}
  7578: Great forces of the dead still rest in Eldieme. We have also discovered an item they all carry when they appear.${prompt}
  7579: 'We failed to obtain one, but they say it is called a ${item-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  7580: Hmm... Perhaps it is a signal of some sort. Let us make use of it in our strategy once we have it.${prompt}
  7581: Well, then...${prompt}
  7582: Yes, we cannot wait for orders from the expeditionary forces. We shall send a cadre of worthy adventurers.${prompt}
  7583: 'Make for Fei''Yin upon acquiring the ${item-singular: 7[2]} in Eldieme.${prompt}'
  7584: Greater rewards await those who serve with distinction. May fortune favor you!${prompt}
  7585: This place is not open to commoners, but since you're here, have a look. Queen Leaute would be pleased.${prompt}
  7586: ${name-player}! Many are those who speak of your triumphs in the name of San d'Oria!${prompt}
  7587: And much have I heard of your journeys abroad, and how you fought nether beasts in the lair of the enemy.${prompt}
  7588: So the return of the Shadow Lord is at hand. Perhaps never will the hand of evil be banished from this world.${prompt}
  7589: But always will the righteous stand up to face it. Am I not right, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  7590: 'The Royal Knights have but a single purpose: to exterminate the Orcs who ravage our lands!${prompt}'
  7591: We have sent scouts already to the Orcish stronghold of Davoi.${prompt}
  7592: They are to report on the Orcs' numbers, map the territory, and find their lines of supply. Once such knowledge is ours, we shall strike.${prompt}
  7593: But, the scouts' report has not yet arrived! What could this mean?${prompt}
  7594: What? The Temple Knights have also sent scouts to Davoi? On whose orders?${prompt}
  7595: Pieuje. I knew it! What madness has made him do this?${prompt}
  7596: But, we must not be dismayed. ${name-player}, I want you to head to Davoi straight away.${prompt}
  7597: 'Seek the Royal Knight Quemaricond and take his ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}. Now, make haste!${prompt}'
  7598: 'You''re back! Quick, show me the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  7599: What a report! We must send troops immediately!${prompt}
  7600: No, but wait... This matter requires more than Royal Knights... Confound it! We need Temple Knights as well!${prompt}
  7601: Perfaumand! Where are Pieuje and Curilla?${prompt}
  7602: Your Highness, Lady Curilla is in the quarters of the Temple Knights. As for Prince Pieuje...${prompt}
  7603: ${name-player}, your mission is over. Thank you!${prompt}
  7604: So, you're saying nothing was actually taken?${prompt}
  7605: That is right, Lord Halver. I can see ransacking our treasure vaults, but the chambers of Leaute I d'Oraguille? What could they have been after?${prompt}
  7606: The chambers are as they were when the queen passed away. Might she have left something of importance?${prompt}
  7607: Her jewelry all went untouched. It is possible that the thieves mistook the queen's chambers for another room.${prompt}
  7608: 'Hmm. However, it has come to my attention that ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} has been circulating outside the castle.${prompt}'
  7609: If the thieves possess these floor plans, then perhaps they have motives other than just stealing treasure.${prompt}
  7610: 'That may be true. But even with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, it would take a skilled thief indeed to hide from all the guards in the chateau.${prompt}'
  7611: And according to the gardener, our visitors were a party of two Elvaan...${prompt}
  7612: It has come to my attention that thieves have ransacked the queen's chambers. Inform me immediately of what was stolen!${prompt}
  7613: |-
    Please be at ease, Your Holiness.
    The Temple Knights have determined that the thieves stole nothing from the chateau.${prompt}
  7614: |-
    Preposterous!
    If so, why did the thieves enter in the first place? Maybe the queen had something hidden...${prompt}
  7615: Pardon me, Your Holiness, but what do you mean by “something”?${prompt}
  7616: If I knew, I wouldn't be asking you! But thieves would not enter without a purpose!${prompt}
  7617: Of course, Your Holiness. I will order the Temple Knights to continue their investigation, and have them inform you if they find anything.${prompt}
  7618: I shall be waiting for your report. Hmph! Not even the Goddess Altana will forgive such a crime!${prompt}
  7619: Hmm? It seems as if we have a visitor.
  7620: You were sent to stop the thieves? Well, as you can see, they have already escaped.${prompt}
  7621: Considering we know nothing of the thieves, it would be futile to send out a search party.${prompt}
  7622: However, an adventurer such as yourself would have connections in many more places than we.${prompt}
  7623: Inquire with the gardener. He is the only one who saw the thieves. He may tell you something of importance.${prompt}
  7624: Inquire with the gardener. He is the only one who said he saw the thieves. He may tell you something that rings a bell.${prompt}
  7625: Ah, I know you. You're that adventurer ${name-player}. You want to know about the thieves that broke into the queen's chambers?${prompt}
  7626: Well, I didn't see anything special. All I saw was two suspicious lookin' Elvaan. When I yelled at 'em, they ran off. That be all.${prompt}
  7627: But I swear I seen me one before... The one with blue armor...${prompt}
  7628: Chalvatot, what has happened in my mother's chambers?${prompt}
  7629: When I went to give some water to the flowers, I passed by some Temple Guards.${prompt}
  7630: I am so sorry, Your Highness! Last night, some thieves broke into the late queen's chambers!${prompt}
  7631: And to make matters worse, the scoundrels are still on the loose! Oh, what has become of the once mighty Chateau d'Oraguille?${prompt}
  7632: I--I do not know what to say...${prompt}
  7633: I knew something was wrong when I found my mother's diary in a strange place...${prompt}
  7634: Your Highness? You say you saw something out of the ordinary?${prompt}
  7635: Chalvatot, something is amiss... Could you please come to my chambers later?${prompt}
  7636: Farewell, ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}. May you find the thieves that disgraced our great kingdom.${prompt}
  7637: Why, welcome back, ${name-player}. I'm sure the lords of both knightly orders would like to hear your report right away.${prompt}
  7638: So, the seal of Fei'Yin is broken... We must face the prospect of nether beasts laying siege this land, as did they two decades past.${prompt}
  7639: Peculiar have been their actions of late, and now this... We must act swiftly.${prompt}
  7640: Yes, but our obligation to the alliance denies unilateral deployment to lands abroad. Were not the Northlands reduced to ashes in wars of old?${prompt}
  7641: This does not bode well. Vigilantly we watched that land, and still this comes to pass!${prompt}
  7642: Yes, I am afraid you are right. Our eyes were on the comings and goings of Orcs, ignorant of the greater threat.${prompt}
  7643: And how should we explain this to our allies? San d'Oria cannot become the laughingstock of the civilized world!${prompt}
  7644: Are such words even necessary?${prompt}
  7645: Prince Trion!${prompt}
  7646: Before they hit us, let us hit them. A bold strike would hamper their momentum.${prompt}
  7647: But, my prince! By sending troops into the Northlands, we expose ourselves to a certain degree of diplomatic liability...${prompt}
  7648: Liability!? Fools! Are you all blind to this peril? The enemy approaches while we bicker!${prompt}
  7649: Yes, Prince Trion... However, we should involve the king and Prince Pieuje in this decision.${prompt}
  7650: Curilla, do you share the opinion of Halver and Rahal?${prompt}
  7651: Yes, my prince. We know not the enemy's numbers. I believe the peril of rushing headlong into battle would be too great.${prompt}
  7652: Indeed, word of the Shadow Lord's return was brought to us by adventurers, and is as yet unconfirmed.${prompt}
  7653: And if it did happen to be true, all the knights of San d'Oria would not be enough. We must confer with the alliance, my prince!${prompt}
  7654: Hmph. So be it! All this talk of diplomatic liability... There are people we must defend, and an enemy we must defeat. Naught matters but that simple truth!${prompt}
  7655: In such times, where could Pieuje be going?${prompt}
  7656: Prince Trion...${prompt}
  7657: Hmm... We must make haste and decide upon policy for our kingdom. At any rate, the exploration of Fei'Yin is complete.${prompt}
  7658: Much time may be needed before we reach a conclusion. Rest and prepare for other expeditions. And thank you for your dutiful service.${prompt}
  7659: Ah, it is you, ${name-player}. I was beginning to wonder who would be chosen for this next mission. You may proceed to the Audience Chamber.${prompt}
  7660: Long have we awaited your arrival, ${name-player}. Your assistance is required in a mission for the Kingdom.${prompt}
  7661: Where is the king, you ask? His Highness has retired to his quarters for the day. Recently, he has not been in the best of health.${prompt}
  7662: There is no need to be concerned with my father's condition. Now that Lightbringer has found its way back to San d'Oria, the king has begun to show great improvement. He should be back to his normal self within days.${prompt}
  7663: 'Now as for the reason you were summoned here: the papsque has called upon you to perform an investigation. His Holiness should be here shortly.${prompt}'
  7664: I apologize for my tardiness.${prompt}
  7665: I have assembled you all here today to report a grave new finding.${prompt}
  7666: It seems as of late, a magical wall of sorts has been placed around San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7667: A magical wall, you say?${prompt}
  7668: And what is more, this barrier greatly resembles the one that was utilized during the Great War to protect Tavnazia from its enemies.${prompt}
  7669: |-
    An “Elemental Barrier”...
    Quite odd... To my knowledge, only an heir to the Tavnazian throne would be able to procure such magic.${prompt}
  7670: |-
    Rochefogne...
    That scoundrel is up to something.${prompt}
  7671: However, what could his motives be? This magic wall--it has brought no harm to the Kingdom, has it?${prompt}
  7672: While this is true, there are still many aspects to this phenomenon that we do not understand. I feel it may be unwise to come to any hasty conclusions.${prompt}
  7673: Ah, and this is why you have requested the assistance of the adventurer ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7674: That is correct, Your Highness. To maintain such a wall, a medium is required at its center. While mediums differ depending on the type of magic used, I am positive that one is buried somewhere near San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7675: And its location is?${prompt}
  7676: With San d'Oria as the center, it can be assumed that three mediums have been buried. As far as I can ascertain, there would be one in each of the areas of Vollbow, Valdeaunia, and Norvallen...${prompt}
  7677: If it were me, I would bury them somewhere an adventurer would be least likely to travel...but where would that be?${prompt}
  7678: Your Holiness, it sounds as if you are quite skilled at burying things...${prompt}
  7679: I-I... I have cast many a magic wall in my time. I am just calling on my past experience.${prompt}
  7680: ${name-player}, you must take extreme caution if you happen to come across the mediums. They must be disengaged in the correct order, and my instincts tell me that a trap may be set.${prompt}
  7681: Once again, the papsque has impressed us all with his extensive knowledge on the situation at hand.${prompt}
  7682: |-
    Yes.
    Well, ${name-player} is one of San d'Oria's finest adventurers. I am certain that ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] will locate the mediums and succeed in destroying them.${prompt}
  7683: May the Goddess bless you with Her grace on your journey.${prompt}
  7684: With that Rochefogne running about, we will be forced to postpone the Rites of Succession. We would not want another scene like at the coming-of-age ceremony. We have our father's health to think about.${prompt}
  7685: However, if what he says is true, and he truly is the heir to the Marquisate, then that means we share the same blood...${prompt}
  7686: That is correct, my brother.${prompt}
  7687: |-
    Claidie!
    You know quite well that you are not allowed to interfere with these meetings.${prompt}
  7688: Have you already forgotten? I have completed my coming-of-age ceremony. I have the right to attend.${prompt}
  7689: She is correct...${prompt}
  7690: |-
    Hah. I apologize, Claidie.
    Well, as long as you are present, let us hear your opinion on the situation at hand.${prompt}
  7691: As Pieuje has just stated, Rochefogne is our uncle...our mother's younger brother.${prompt}
  7692: That is, if you believe the scoundrel.${prompt}
  7693: And that is the exact reason why it is necessary to sit down and discuss with him the matters before us.${prompt}
  7694: His outburst at my coming-of-age ceremony has enlightened me unto a piece of San d'Oria's terrible past.${prompt}
  7695: Watch what you say, Claidie. Not all of us here are of the royal family.${prompt}
  7696: |-
    I have nothing to hide, Brother.
    During the Great War, the San d'Orian army led the beastman hordes to Tavnazia. San d'Oria used the Marquisate as a decoy.${prompt}
  7697: However, that decision was an important turning point in the war. The gallant battle waged by the citizens of Tavnazia dealt a forceful blow to the beastman forces and gave us enough time to prepare our armies.${prompt}
  7698: Yes, a turning point that meant the loss of thousands of innocent lives and the end of a proud nation.${prompt}
  7699: Tavnazia was destroyed when the beastmen's secret weapon malfunctioned. Nothing, not even the beastmen themselves, were left after that calamity.${prompt}
  7700: Then why do you not sit down with Rochefogne and tell him this? Why must you capture him without being sure of his motives? Am I to believe this is how the royal family deals with its problems?${prompt}
  7701: Can you not remember what transpired at your coming-of-age ceremony? Rochefogne did not seem as if he wanted to sit down and chat over a cup of tea.${prompt}
  7702: |-
    ...
    There must have been some reason... Some reason he could not tell us at that time...${prompt}
  7703: And that is why we must first capture him. Only then will we be able to clear up that which troubles our two sides.${prompt}
  7704: All right, but I ask you to promise me one thing. Do not hurt Rochefogne when you capture him.${prompt}
  7705: Hah. I will heed your wish. However, if he lays a hand on any of my knights, I will be forced to take action.${prompt}
  7706: |-
    Yes, Brother.
    That is all I have to say.${prompt}
  7707: ${name-player}, search out and destroy these “mediums” that the papsque mentioned earlier. Only by doing so will the Kingdom be safe from the treachery behind this fiendish plan.${prompt}
  7708: |-
    Trion.
    I think it is time for us to call on the services of the “Cadavres des Corneilles.”${prompt}
  7709: The “Cadavres des Corneilles”! Pieuje, are you mad!?${prompt}
  7710: Think, my brother. If we allow Rochefogne to run about as he pleases, the consequences could be irreparable.${prompt}
  7711: If ${name-player} is able to destroy the “Elemental Barrier,” we can be sure that Rochefogne will be near. If we make the first move, we may be able to capture him.${prompt}
  7712: |-
    Hmmm...
    Then do as you wish.${prompt}
  7713: I ask the same of you that I did my brothers. If you find Rochefogne, please do not harm him. He is trying to tell us something, I know it...${prompt}
  7714: |-
    <Sigh>
    If this is how it is to be, then I must take things into my own hands...${prompt}
  7715: His Majesty has taken quite ill over the past few days and is currently resting in his chambers. During his leave of absence from the throne, the two princes have taken his place. However, things should be running as smoothly as always.${prompt}
  7716: The papsque is most certain that the objects in question will be found in the areas of Vollbow, Valdeaunia, and Norvallen. You must treat this matter with the utmost delicacy. We cannot afford to have foreign powers taking advantage of our situation.${prompt}
  7717: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}.
    I have already read through Coteaulepoint's report. The fact that Rochefogne's body has not turned up troubles me; however, I must commend you on your efforts in disabling the Elemental Barrier.${prompt}
  7718: As for the remaining details of what happened...${prompt}
  7719: |-
    How do you reply?
    ${selection-lines}
    Understood, Your Highness.
    Remaining details?${prompt}
  7720: |-
    Excellent.
    You understand well the sensitive matters of the Kingdom.${prompt}
  7721: Do not mock me, ${name-player}. You know quite well what I am speaking of.${prompt}
  7722: The existence of the “Cadavres des Corneilles” must remain a national secret. If news of this organization were to spread to the ears of the other nations, the consequences would be grave. And with our father as ill as he is...${prompt}
  7723: Our father is feeling much better now. He should be returning to his proper position on the throne shortly.${prompt}
  7724: |-
    The Rites of Succession are upon us. When the time comes, we will be once again calling upon your services.
    You are dismissed.${prompt}
  7725: Pieuje, what has become of our younger sister?${prompt}
  7726: She has shut herself up in our mother's garden...${prompt}
  7727: |-
    Hmmm...
    She must realize that what we are doing is for the good of the Kingdom.${prompt}
  7728: Trion...${prompt}
  7729: What is it that troubles you, Pieuje?${prompt}
  7730: What if... What if neither of us are worthy enough to draw forth Lightbringer?${prompt}
  7731: |-
    Hah hah hah!
    Your petty worries and niggling prudence amuse me, Brother.${prompt}
  7732: Fear not, as there are none more worthy than we.${prompt}
  7733: '...${prompt}'
  7734: Who goes there?${prompt}
  7735: |-
    An Orc? Why would an Orc be here?
    Hello? Is anyone around?${prompt}
  7736: The “Cadavres des Corneilles”!?${prompt}
  7737: |-
    So the Orcs have made it this far. Not surprising, with the magical wall being destroyed...
    This forces us to change our plans.${prompt}
  7738: |-
    Why, you dirty scoundrel!
    Leave this place at once! You have no right being here!${prompt}
  7739: I apologize, Your Highness. However, I ask a moment of your time to talk...${prompt}
  7740: You wish to talk...with me?${prompt}
  7741: Who... Who are you?${prompt}
  7742: With the recovery of the royaulais, the Rites of Succession will soon be upon us. The preparations for such an important ceremony will create many sleepless nights for those of us working here in the chateau.${prompt}
  7743: Rochefogne was slain? If it was not one of the Royal Knights, then... No, it is not possible...${prompt}
  7744: I have heard the rumors of the fate of Rochefogne. However, I will not believe he is dead until I have seen the body with my own eyes.${prompt}
  7745: |-
    The Rites of Succession...
    At last our new leader will be chosen...${prompt}
  7746: We have increased the guard for the Rites of Succession twofold. We do not wish a repeat of the fiasco caused by Rochefogne at the coming-of-age ceremony.${prompt}
  7747: I still feel responsible for letting the scoundrel near His Majesty. However, were it not for the events of that day, we would not be in our present position.${prompt}
  7748: I still lack the judgment to know what is truth, and what is merely a lie...${prompt}
  7749: I see you have all arrived. Now all we have is to wait for Claidie.${prompt}
  7750: Ah, how is he? How is Rochefogne?${prompt}
  7751: He is still unconscious. While the blow missed his vital organs, he has still sustained a great deal of damage. The doctors have told me that all we could do is watch and pray...${prompt}
  7752: |-
    I see... Then we must wait until we may ask any more questions.
    However, I have just learned that the role of Lightbringer in the Rites of Succession was conceived by the papsque himself...${prompt}
  7753: He lied to us about the true inscription on the stone tablet. The true inscription speaks of how the sword must be protected at all times and must never be drawn.${prompt}
  7754: Why would the papsque fabricate such untruths?${prompt}
  7755: The papsque had come to believe that Lightbringer was the key to the Gates of Paradise. It seems as if the Archduke of Jeuno's brother, Eald'narche, led him to believe this...${prompt}
  7756: Because the sword can only be drawn by a member of the royal family, His Holiness conceived the Rites of Succession.${prompt}
  7757: So the ceremony was a farce...?${prompt}
  7758: It cannot be true...${prompt}
  7759: We shall never know the full extent of the papsque's ambition, but just like us, he was lured by the awesome power that Lightbringer harbors in its blade.${prompt}
  7760: Then what...is Lightbringer?${prompt}
  7761: Right now, all we can believe is what Rochefogne has told us.${prompt}
  7762: Lightbringer is the weapon that laid waste to Tavnazia...${prompt}
  7763: Whatever the case, we cannot afford to let the beastmen attempt to use it, even if it takes the dispatch of every last soldier in San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7764: Father, let me take command of the army.${prompt}
  7765: Trion...?${prompt}
  7766: I am to blame for the loss of Lightbringer. The responsibility of retrieving it lies within me.${prompt}
  7767: |-
    I was the one who ignored Claidie's pleas to attempt negotiations with Rochefogne. If it were not for my foolish pride, none of this would ever have been brought upon San d'Oria!
    Father! Allow me the chance to redeem myself!${prompt}
  7768: Curb your conceit, Trion!${prompt}
  7769: Father...!?${prompt}
  7770: Trion, you are simply dancing on the stage of destiny. It is time for you to come down and face reality.${prompt}
  7771: Father...${prompt}
  7772: I will command the army.${prompt}
  7773: Trion, you will stand on the front lines and show the knights the true honor and valor of the d'Oraguille family.${prompt}
  7774: Pieuje, you will maintain the supply routes, providing constant support to the front line and your brother.${prompt}
  7775: Claidie, you will tend to Rochefogne, as well as watch over him. He has yet to win my trust.${prompt}
  7776: ${name-player}, after this display, you must think the royal family pitiful. However, I have one last request of you. I wish you to stand on the front lines with Trion.${prompt}
  7777: And finally, we must not forget that we must be faithful to the citizens of this kingdom. We stand on the foundation they built. We must not lose their trust.${prompt}
  7778: |-
    Your Highness!
    One of our scouts has returned!
    The Orcs carrying Lightbringer have been spotted entering the Qu'Bia Arena!${prompt}
  7779: Good work. Tell the scout to rest from his journey.${prompt}
  7780: I order all our soldiers to Fei'Yin! And tell them that the fate of San d'Oria rides on their bravery!${prompt}
  7781: ${name-player}! We can count on your assistance in our country's time of need, can we not? This is no longer a matter that can be handled by the royal family alone!${prompt}
  7782: In the years I have served as a Royal Knight, I have been sent on many missions. However, this expedition to Fei'Yin means much more to me than most have.${prompt}
  7783: I dedicate this battle to the knights I have lost. I will not let the blood they shed go in vain. We will defeat our enemies!${prompt}
  7784: It is time for the Temple Knights and the Royal Knights to put their differences aside for the good of the Kingdom. We must retrieve Lightbringer at all costs!${prompt}
  7785: Let this battle once again bring glory to the Temple Knights!${prompt}
  7786: Prince Trion has departed for Fei'Yin. May the grace of the Goddess bring victory to the knights of the Kingdom!${prompt}
  7787: |-
    Prince Pieuje has left with the expedition to Fei'Yin.
    I can only pray for his safety.${prompt}
  7788: Prince Trion has returned safely and is currently awaiting your arrival in the Audience Chamber.${prompt}
  7789: Prince Pieuje has returned without injury and is awaiting your arrival in the Audience Chamber.${prompt}
  7790: |-
    ${name-player}! I never doubted your ability on the front line. We are truly in your debt.
    Proceed to the Audience Chamber. His Highness awaits!${prompt}
  7791: I have heard of your valiant efforts from my son. It would not be an understatement to say that your repeated bravery has helped maintain peace throughout the Kingdom.${prompt}
  7792: As for Lightbringer, as long as Rochefogne remains unconscious...${prompt}
  7793: Your Highness!${prompt}
  7794: Ah, Rochefogne. Claidie has kept me informed on your condition. How are you feeling?${prompt}
  7795: I am in debt to your fine daughter for all she has done for me.${prompt}
  7796: |-
    Your Highness...
    Allow me to apologize for all the trouble I have caused you and your kingdom.${prompt}
  7797: |-
    You do so much resemble your sister...
    Forgive me. We all thought you had perished during the Great War. If I had only known that you were the true Rochefogne, we might have been able to prevent the loss of so many lives.${prompt}
  7798: Your Highness...${prompt}
  7799: |-
    You may rise, Rochefogne.
    As much as I would like to reminisce of times past, I first wish to know of Lightbringer.${prompt}
  7800: Certainly.${prompt}
  7801: Long ago, the Dragon King, Ranperre, entrusted the Tavnazian Marquisate with the duty of protecting Lightbringer. All members of the royal family learn of this duty during their coming-of-age ceremony.${prompt}
  7802: So our mother knew as well?${prompt}
  7803: Yes, my sister knew of Lightbringer. She also knew that the pollen of the dreamrose had the ability to temporarily neutralize the power of the blade.${prompt}
  7804: So the pollen I threw... My mother left it in her will for such circumstances!${prompt}
  7805: However, while we knew of our duty, none in Tavnazia knew the true power of an unsheathed Lightbringer. We were simply told to never draw the mighty blade.${prompt}
  7806: But when the beastman forces made their way to our castle gates...${prompt}
  7807: On that fateful day when the beastmen had taken the city, my family made an attempt to escape to San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7808: However, being young and proud, I could not stand and watch as my country was engulfed in the flames of war. I seized Lightbringer from my father and headed back to the castle.${prompt}
  7809: I never even made it to the city gates... The Orcs surrounded me, and that is when I drew Lightbringer from its sheath...${prompt}
  7810: And the moment I did, I was engulfed in a brilliant light. I felt as if I were almighty...as if I were a god...${prompt}
  7811: How long I stood there I do not remember. But when I came to, I was lying on a beach...and Lightbringer was nowhere to be found.${prompt}
  7812: The man who rescued me from the sea told me how a great explosion had devastated Tavnazia, sending it deep underwater.${prompt}
  7813: He said that people assumed the calamity was caused by an Orc weapon that had self-destructed, but due to the lack of evidence, no one would ever know.${prompt}
  7814: The shock of the explosion had caused me to lose my memory, and for years after that day, I believed the man's tale of the Orcs' secret weapon. But one day, like a flash of light, the memory of what I had done came back to me.${prompt}
  7815: Because I had drawn that blade, not only my family, but thousands upon thousands of innocent lives, were lost.${prompt}
  7816: From that day forth, I made a pledge to myself that I would not rest until I had found Lightbringer and returned her to her proper place. Only then would I be worthy to die and retreat to the hell that I deserve.${prompt}
  7817: Truly unbelievable...${prompt}
  7818: I see... So San d'Oria's plan to lure the beastman forces to Tavnazia worked because they were drawn to Lightbringer.${prompt}
  7819: But...why were you able to survive the explosion?${prompt}
  7820: While running back to the city, I came across a patch of beautiful dreamroses, and remembered my sister. I do not know why, but I picked one and put it in my breast pocket. I feel that is what might have saved me.${prompt}
  7821: However, the legend of Ranperre tells of how the Dragon King used Lightbringer to bring peace to San d'Oria. How could such an instrument of good bring so much evil?${prompt}
  7822: That, I do not know--though I feel that perhaps Lightbringer was not meant for us.${prompt}
  7823: We shall return it to the late king and let him decide its fate.${prompt}
  7824: I agree. And I have the perfect citizen to help carry out the task.${prompt}
  7825: ${name-player}, you are well-versed in the layout of King Ranperre's Tomb. I ask you to travel there in advance and rid the area of any evil that could endanger the task at hand.${prompt}
  7826: I have a feeling that the Orcs may pay us another unexpected visit.${prompt}
  7827: Proceed to King Ranperre's Tomb with caution. We must be on our guard until Lightbringer has been returned to its proper resting place.${prompt}
  7828: |-
    ${name-player}.
    I never thought I would live to see the day when the Royal Knights would fight alongside adventurers such as yourself. Your valiant efforts on the battlefield helped turn the tide in favor of San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7829: To protect the prince while grappling with the enemy... I feel that even I may not have been able to accomplish such a feat. I applaud your skill.${prompt}
  7830: |-
    Our mission is finally over...
    I feel that sometimes we soldiers forget the frailty of life until we see it lost before our eyes on the battlefield.${prompt}
  7831: |-
    However, that gives us all the more reason to continue the fight. We cannot let those who have parted with us be forgotten.
    If you can spare a moment, journey to the cathedral and offer a prayer for the souls that gave their lives for the glory of the Kingdom.${prompt}
  7832: Oh, ${name-player}, we have been waiting for your arrival. His Highness is about give an address. Please take your position.${prompt}
  7833: I know that your bodies still ache from our recent encounter with the Orcs.${prompt}
  7834: However, I require your utmost attention, for I have an important announcement.${prompt}
  7835: I have decided that it is in the best interest of the Kingdom to prolong the Rites of Succession indefinitely. My sons still have much to learn of ruling a kingdom. Furthermore, when the time comes for me to step down, if I find my sons inadequate, I will not hesitate in selecting an heir from outside the d'Oraguille family.${prompt}
  7836: It is not only the royal family, but others like ${name-player}, that have silently supported San d'Oria for the past twenty years. Perhaps it is an adventurer such as ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] that would be best suited for the throne.${prompt}
  7837: The arrogance of the Elvaan has held back this country for much too long. From today forth, we shall recognize our fellow races and join hands with them to form a stronger, better kingdom.${prompt}
  7838: |-
    ${name-player}.
    I am aware of the hardships you have had to face at the request of your country. However, you must realize that without your undying loyalty to the Kingdom, we would never have been able to realize our erring ways.${prompt}
  7839: 'While simple items cannot express the gratitude this kingdom owes you, I hope you will accept this ${item-singular: 0[2]} with my blessing.${prompt}'
  7840: We can hold our heads high knowing that there are adventurers such as ${name-player}, willing to risk their lives for the good of the Kingdom.${prompt}
  7841: Now it is the time for the citizens of San d'Oria to do their part.${prompt}
  7842: Thanks to your efforts, the chateau regained that sense of peacefulness that it had lacked for so long.${prompt}
  7843: I may have been strict with you when you were still a fledgling adventurer. However, I wish for you to forget all that. I now hold nothing but the uttermost respect for you.${prompt}
  7844: There is still much work to be done, but you may leave that to us. We do not wish to hold you back from new adventures that await you.${prompt}
  7845: Now that Lightbringer has been sealed in the Dragon King's tomb, the Orcs' activity has begun to dwindle. We will shortly be sending soldiers to rid the land of the remaining hordes.${prompt}
  7846: As much as your presence on the front line would be welcomed, we cannot run to you to solve all our national crises.${prompt}
  7847: However, I expect that one day the Kingdom may again require your services. But until that day, may the light of the Goddess shine down upon you!${prompt}
  7848: The conflict with the Orcs may be finally coming to an end, but I doubt that instant peace will follow. We Temple Knights must remain alert at all times, lest danger rear its head within the boundaries of our noble kingdom.${prompt}
  7849: ${name-player}, would you not consider joining our ranks? You have much untapped potential.${prompt}
  7850: |-
    Join the Temple Knights?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  7851: While I am flattered by your enthusiasm, I know that you would not be satisfied if tied down by the duties of the knights. Your place is under the open skies of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7852: As I expected. I know that you would not be satisfied if tied down by the duties of the knights. Your place is under the open skies of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7853: Now go! Adventure awaits!${prompt}
  7854: The battle took its toll on us knights. I am relieved there won't be any more expeditions in the near future...but don't tell Sir Rahal I said that.${prompt}
  7855: Lady Curilla and the Temple Knights have found Lightbringer... Who would've thought that it would have been found in such a place? ${prompt}
  7856: We knights must keep our senses sharp and our blades sharper. If we let either dull, it could mean our lives!${prompt}
  7857: The battle at Fei'Yin dealt a fierce blow to the Orcs. I think that now is the time to finish those fiends off once and for all. The day of peace is finally here!${prompt}
  7858: The defeat of the Shadow Lord should improve the situation in the Northlands and improve our odds in the war with the Orcs.${prompt}
  7859: There's not a knight in San d'Oria that doesn't wish to take Lightbringer in his hands. However, there are still many mysteries that surround it...${prompt}
  7860: It's now time to show those Orcs the true force of the Royal Knights. The battle will go down in history as the day we put an end to their fiendish plots!${prompt}
  7861: When I was in the Northlands, I didn't know if I would ever be back here, sipping tea in the comforts of my quarters. I raise my glass to my colleagues who were not as fortunate...${prompt}
  7862: I never knew His Highness felt that way about the Kingdom... To put the stability of the country ahead of bloodlines and tradition...the royaulais is truly a great leader.${prompt}
  7863: ${name-player}, you have my gratitude for saving my life in the Qu'Bia Arena.${prompt}
  7864: The Royal Knights have driven the Orcs into a corner. Our conflict with fiends will soon be resolved. As much as I wish to stand on the frontline with my fellow soldiers, I have many new responsibilities to face here in the chateau.${prompt}
  7865: I may, once again, require your services. Until then, may the Goddess shine Her glory upon you in your travels.${prompt}
  7866: As my father stated, you may be more suited than I to rule our kingdom...${prompt}
  7867: However, whether or not I ever stand at the pinnacle of San d'Oria is not important. This situation with Rochefogne, Lightbringer, and the Orcs has taught me much of what I lack as a leader.${prompt}
  7868: Far too often I have relied on your bravery and loyalty. If it were not for your gallant actions, I would have surely perished in the Northlands.${prompt}
  7869: If your journeys ever bring you back here to San d'Oria, you will always be welcome. Not as an adventurer, but as a friend.${prompt}
  7870: I have heard from my brother of your bravery in Fei'Yin.${prompt}
  7871: Your success on the battlefield never ceases to amaze me. There is much I could learn from you...${prompt}
  7872: I applaud you on the completion of this mission, as well as apologize for constantly weighing your adventures down with new responsibilities.${prompt}
  7873: However, your accomplishments have been, and will be, crucial for the prosperity of the Kingdom. I can sense that your love for San d'Oria is great.${prompt}
  7874: Not lending our ears to the thoughts and opinions of others, only thinking that we are correct...${prompt}
  7875: However, I now realize that this is the sin we Elvaan are guilty of... That is why I ask of you to guide us. If you feel there is an error in our ways, do not hesitate to inform us.${prompt}
  7876: I will use your words to shape this country into a land that you, or your children, or your children's children will not be ashamed of.${prompt}
  7877: Why, ${name-player}. You have become quite the fighter since we last met. I can tell by merely glancing at your arms. Those are the limbs of someone who has spent many an hour polishing ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] skills.${prompt}
  7878: However, if you were to take part in the Kingdom's tourneys, you would most certainly be defeated in the preliminary rounds.${prompt}
  7879: |-
    I sense a hint of question in your eyes. Let me explain...
    What separates the champions from the common folk lies in the acquisition of a single technique.${prompt}
  7880: That technique is...${prompt}
  7881: Lady Curilla! We have completed our patrol of the perimeter! There is nothing to report!${prompt}
  7882: Understood. Inform the guards in waiting to begin their shift. You may rest in your quarters until you are summoned.${prompt}
  7883: Yes, Lady Curilla!${prompt}
  7884: Uh...um...Lady Curilla?${prompt}
  7885: What do you want? Do you have something else to report?${prompt}
  7886: Wh-who might this adventurer be...?${prompt}
  7887: Do you mean ${name-player}? ${choice-player-gender}[His/Her] skill with the single-handed blade has become quite renowned throughout the Kingdom. I am pondering over whether or not I should teach ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] the final technique and recommend ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] for the tourneys.${prompt}
  7888: The final technique!? You don't think ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] could really...${prompt}
  7889: Hah hah. Your training for the technique transformed you from a bumbling squire to the proud knight you are today. Who is to say that ${name-player} will not be able to handle the trial?${prompt}
  7890: Th-that is true, but...but, ${name-player} is just an adventurer. If ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] were to be i-injured during the training, think of the repercussions...${prompt}
  7891: |-
    Do I look as if I have not considered the repercussions? Do you wish to suggest that my judgment is erroneous?
    Now off with you! Sufficient rest is an essential part of your duties!${prompt}
  7892: Y-yes, ma'am!${prompt}
  7893: <Sigh>...${prompt}
  7894: I apologize for the interruption. However, my offer remains. If you wish to continue with your training in the way of the sword, I will assist. The knights may seem to think differently, but I assure you you need not worry.${prompt}
  7895: Take this sword. It will bless you with its power until it senses that your skills have matured. Only then you will be ready to learn the final technique.${prompt}
  7896: |-
    Will you partake in this trial?
    ${selection-lines}
    I would be honored.
    Not just yet...${prompt}
  7897: Positive was I of your answer before you even spoke it. I can sense your desire for knowledge and power.${prompt}
  7898: Now take up in your hands this sword and begin your training.${prompt}
  7899: When you feel that the sword has recognized your might, return to me with the weakened blade. I will judge whether or not your journey is over.${prompt}
  7900: |-
    However, that is when the true trial will begin...
    I wish you luck, but you must remember it is not luck, but skill and perseverance, that will lead you back to this hall.${prompt}
  7901: So there is still doubt in your heart. Irresolution can be a deadly thing on the battlefield. I advise you purge yourself of this trait before setting out on any more adventures.${prompt}
  7902: 'I do not yet feel that the ${item-singular: 0[2]} has recognized your true strength. You have much road yet to travel.${prompt}'
  7903: Ah, ${name-player}. “Trade” me the sword if you wish me to evaluate your progress. Or is there another reason why you have called?${prompt}
  7904: |-
    Why are you here?
    ${selection-lines}
    I've misplaced the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.
    I wish to end my training.
    I apologize for the disturbance.${prompt}
  7905: The blade that you have “misplaced” was specially ordered for the training of the San d'Orian knights. A large sum of the Kingdom's tax money was used to purchase it. What you have done could be considered a crime!${prompt}
  7906: <Sigh> But it was I who made the decision to begin your training, therefore I will take responsibility for your actions this time. However, If you do not wish to travel to each and every one of our citizens' residences and make a personal apology for squandering their hard-earned gil, I suggest that you be more careful in the future.${prompt}
  7907: You cannot be serious! Think of the opportunity you are passing by! I will give you one more chance...${prompt}
  7908: |-
    Do you really want to end your training?
    ${selection-lines}
    I am positive.
    On second thought...${prompt}
  7909: Excellent. I am not sure of your intentions today, but if you were searching for kind words of moral support, you will not find them here. Such gibberish can only bind one and lead them to a false sense of success.${prompt}
  7910: I see... I have trained many knights, and among them have been many who put down their swords just as you have. However, with time, those knights have faded into obscurity, their decision haunting them day in and day out.${prompt}
  7911: If you do not wish to join their ranks, return here, and I will reconsider your training. I believe that you will make the correct decision.${prompt}
  7912: Ah yes, this sword sings of your strength and courageousness. I can see that you are ready for any challenge put forth before you.${prompt}
  7913: However, as I mentioned before, the true trial has yet to begin. It is now time to prove your skill. Normally we would send a pair of knights to complete this final task, but you are strong enough to take on the burden alone.${prompt}
  7914: 'Take this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} and set forth to the Quicksand Caves. There you shall find ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}. Be thorough in your preparations, as your greatest challenge awaits you.${prompt}'
  7915: |-
    You will no longer require the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. You may return it to me. I will watch over it as you continue your training.
    Good luck, and may the Goddess shine her light of grace upon you in battle.${prompt}
  7916: 'Take that ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} and set forth to the Quicksand Caves. There you shall find ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}. Be thorough in your preparations, as your greatest challenge awaits you.${prompt}'
  7917: I applaud you in your completion of the trial. You now have acquired enough skill to wield the final technique.${prompt}
  7918: However, you must not be content. I still feel that you are not yet ready for the grueling challenges that await you at the tourneys.${prompt}
  7919: I remember when I took part in the competition. I wanted to prove my power to the Kingdom. I wanted to prove that there was no one who could match me...${prompt}
  7920: However, that display was only a measure of how weak I actually was...${prompt}
  7921: During the championship match, I was possessed with the lust for victory. That lust powered me, and when I brought down my blade onto Prince Trion, the force was so great that it shattered his weapon.${prompt}
  7922: But as it shattered, a piece of the broken sword flew into my left eye, darkening it for eternity. While I did not lose my life, I had lost something just as important to a knight--my eyesight.${prompt}
  7923: Though I did not let this stand in my way. I continued my training, and just like you, acquired the final technique. And through my training, I learned to rely on more than that which reflects in the eye. I learned to feel what lies in my opponent's heart...${prompt}
  7924: I see that the battle between you and my brother is still being waged.${prompt}
  7925: P-Prince Pieuje! How long have you been...${prompt}
  7926: I just arrived, Curilla. I was beginning to wonder why our captain of the Temple Knights had failed to make her daily report.${prompt}
  7927: |-
    ...!
    I apologize for my tardiness! It will never happen again!${prompt}
  7928: It seems as if you remain weighted down by the burdens you have placed upon your conscience.${prompt}
  7929: Weighted down... Again, I apologize, but I do not believe that is so.${prompt}
  7930: Hah hah. You differ not from my dear brother. The shards of the blade that shattered that day still remain lodged within your hearts.${prompt}
  7931: And so you remain at a distance...neither of you the victor in your ongoing battle.${prompt}
  7932: '...${prompt}'
  7933: Forget what I have said. I will be waiting in my chambers for your report.${prompt}
  7934: Yes, Your Highness.${prompt}
  7935: Curilla, you said that you had “learned to feel what lies in your opponent's heart.” I think that you had best spend some time pondering over those words once again. You may find that you have been missing their true meaning.${prompt}
  7936: I know what those words mean. I know exactly what they mean...${prompt}
  7937: I do not regret losing my eye in that competition. I do not feel that I would be alive today, were it not for all I learned due to that accident.${prompt}
  7938: However, every time I take up my sword, I can feel the dull, throbbing pain it brings to my soul.${prompt}
  7939: |-
    I do not wish for you to make the same mistake as I... I apologize, but I have decided not to recommend you for the tourneys. I am sure there are other adventures more worthy of your newfound skill than a foolish game.
    I wish you all the best in your journeys, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7940: You have learned the weapon skill “Savage Blade”!${prompt}
  7941: Ah, adventurer. I was told of your cooperation in apprehending the thief.${prompt}
  7942: The interrogation is just about to begin. If he is indeed guilty of the crime, you shall receive a reward.${prompt}
  7943: Come with me.${prompt}
  7944: Two years after his defeat at the Second Battle of Konschtat, King Raigegue massed his remaining knights in La Theine and awaited an opportunity to retaliate against Bastok.${prompt}
  7945: It was as you say.${prompt}
  7946: However, seizing upon his brother's absence, Prince Fellenant mobilized the Temple Knights and took control of the city of San d'Oria. He demanded a peace treaty be drawn up with Bastok, correct?${prompt}
  7947: That is correct.${prompt}
  7948: Fearing an internecine war, the king decided to send the Scepter Royaulais to Prince Fellenant and abdicate in his favor. His only condition was that the city be released from military control.${prompt}
  7949: Yes, we were on our way to bring the scepter to Prince Fellenant.${prompt}
  7950: '...When you were beset by a wild storm and took shelter within Ordelle''s Caves...I believe this is how your story goes.${prompt}'
  7951: And what manner of artifact is this Scepter Royaulais you speak of?${prompt}
  7952: Do you not know even this? It is a beautiful scepter with a rare jewel known as the Pierre Errante set at its end. It requires the most careful handling so as not to mar the stone.${prompt}
  7953: '...${prompt}'
  7954: |-
    Will you accept my words as truth now?
    You must allow me audience with Prince Fellenant.${prompt}
  7955: |-
    Deluded fantasies...
    Do you honestly expect to fool us with this fabrication?${prompt}
  7956: |-
    How dare you!
    You accuse me of lying!?${prompt}
  7957: The Second Battle of Konschtat? King Raigegue and Prince Fellenant? This goes beyond all patience!${prompt}
  7958: Then simply wait for the arrival of the Royal Knights who traveled with me--the Cardinal Stags! We were separated in Ordelle's Caves, but they should be arriving in the city at any moment.${prompt}
  7959: Well, isn't that interesting? Captain Guichantmarge of the Cardinal Stags is a good friend of mine, and I have no recollection of seeing your face among his troops when I performed an inspection. Neither do I recall hearing of any new recruits.${prompt}
  7960: Surely you jest, sir!${prompt}
  7961: The Captain of the Cardinal Stags, as all should know, is Sir Plieucherot. Enough of these games!${prompt}
  7962: Monarlais Halver, what are we to do with this individual?${prompt}
  7963: |-
    He is obviously not the person shown in the sketch we have of the thief, nor do the guards of the royal treasury recognize him as the criminal.
    We cannot throw him into a cell merely because he has knowledge of the Scepter Royaulais.${prompt}
  7964: Yet word of that other matter has not leaked beyond our walls. Are we to just let this man go...?${prompt}
  7965: Hmmm... However, I do not believe this fool would have had the finesse required to slip into the treasury. It was open for but a few moments when we removed that other object...${prompt}
  7966: |-
    My sincerest apologies, sir.
    We were taken completely unawares. Only one who had extensive knowledge of the castle could have evaded us in such a way... It was no ordinary burglar.${prompt}
  7967: |-
    Do you still doubt me?
    I am here on orders from the king. Or is this how the prince treats envoys that appear on his doorstep?${prompt}
  7968: Remove him from the chateau. I have not the time nor the patience to deal with his delusions.${prompt}
  7969: Sir.${prompt}
  7970: |-
    I am under orders from the king...
    What are you...? Release me at once!${prompt}
  7971: Mark my words! I, Vijartal Caphieux, have been insulted too many times this day! Your apologies will fall on deaf ears when next we meet!${prompt}
  7972: |-
    Wait one moment...
    What did you just say?${prompt}
  7973: I said to remember the name of Vijartal Caphieux! I will never forget the disgraces I was forced to endure at your hands!${prompt}
  7974: This is an outrage!${prompt}
  7975: The name of the revered hero of San d'Oria used in vain by this common bandit! Have you no honor!?${prompt}
  7976: What is this you speak of?${prompt}
  7977: |-
    Simpleton!
    That is the name of the great man who ended the war between the Royal and Temple Knights two hundred years ago! Even a child would not tell such a scandalous lie!${prompt}
  7978: |-
    Get out of my sight!
    The next time you show your face in my presence, I will not be held responsible for my actions!${prompt}
  7979: |-
    What do you mean, “two hundred years ago”?
    Explain yourself. Why am I considered a hero...?${prompt}
  7980: I am sorry, but I cannot pay you a reward. He is not the man we are looking for.${prompt}
  7981: "However, we must retrieve the scepter at any cost. \nIt is an invaluable treasure. The symbol of San d'Oria.${prompt}"
  7982: 'Give that gate guard a message for me: he still has a chance to prove himself.${prompt}'
  7983: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}!
    I require your keen eye and tireless endurance in a most important matter!${prompt}
  7984: You see, I was speaking with His Majesty just the other day...${prompt}
  7985: You sent for me, Your Majesty?${prompt}
  7986: |-
    Halver, it is most troublesome. There is something I must confer with you about.
    Nay, rather I have a request for you.${prompt}
  7987: Yes, Your Majesty?${prompt}
  7988: |-
    Ahem. Well, how do I begin?
    Do you recall the day when my beloved Leaute first came to the chateau?${prompt}
  7989: Why, of course. The chateau was buzzing with rumors of the lovely Tavnazian princess that was destined to be our next queen.${prompt}
  7990: |-
    At the time I was but a lowly student, and I snuck out of a lecture to catch a glimpse of her noble countenance...
    In the end, I skipped the entire class to see the royal parade.${prompt}
  7991: I managed to view Queen Leaute's fair profile from the gathered crowd. That image is still burned into my mind even now.${prompt}
  7992: I never dreamed that I would end up working so closely with the beautiful princess I saw that day. Queen Leaute would always smile and have a kind word for me...${prompt}
  7993: Halver. I wasn't asking you for a rambling trip down memory lane.${prompt}
  7994: Ah, my apologies, Your Majesty. Was this request related in some way to the queen?${prompt}
  7995: |-
    This has nothing to do with Leaute.
    I wanted to speak with you about a new queen.${prompt}
  7996: |-
    !!!
    Again, I must apologize for not seeing straight to the heart of the matter, Your Majesty.${prompt}
  7997: Hrmph. I thought perhaps it was time the subject was breached.${prompt}
  7998: Ah... Well, Your Majesty has been alone for quite some time now. I am sure that your late wife would completely understand.${prompt}
  7999: Yes, I do not doubt that Leaute has been uneasy in her eternal rest. Halver, I want you to search for a suitable lady to become the future Queen of San d'Oria.${prompt}
  8000: |-
    Me, Your Majesty?
    I...I am honored that you would place that kind of trust in me, but I'm not sure...
    Ahem. If Your Majesty commands it, I will do my utmost to fulfill this duty.${prompt}
  8001: And what qualities would be desirable for the lady to possess?${prompt}
  8002: Hmmm. Naturally, she must have a compassionate heart for all of our subjects, as did my dear Leaute.${prompt}
  8003: |-
    Your Majesty, even now your thoughts are with her...
    It makes my heart ache to think of the loss you must be feeling.${prompt}
  8004: This is a somewhat difficult question, but should the lady be blessed in appearance? A person of similar features to Queen Leaute?${prompt}
  8005: |-
    It is said that men always look for the image of their mother, however...
    These things you should be asking of the lady's future husband. Finding out his preferences will be part of this task.${prompt}
  8006: First, I must talk to the future husband...${prompt}
  8007: '...Future husband? Image of their mother? Your Majesty, what exactly are we talking about here?${prompt}'
  8008: Haven't you been listening, Halver? We are speaking of Trion's bride-to-be!${prompt}
  8009: Of course, it is yet to be decided whether or not Trion is to succeed me. However, it is a distinct possibility. It will be necessary to find Pieuje a bride as well, but for the moment I believe we should search for a fitting consort for Crown Prince Trion.${prompt}
  8010: |-
    Prince Trion...
    So that is what this is all about. I thought our conversation peculiar...${prompt}
  8011: "The only peculiar thing around here is you, Halver! \nIn any case, I entrust you with the duty of finding Trion a suitable wife and arranging an introduction.${prompt}"
  8012: This need not be so difficult if Trion is merely made aware of the fact that he has approached a marriageable age.${prompt}
  8013: Aha... Only, I have never spoken with Prince Trion on the subject of his...preferences.${prompt}
  8014: |-
    ...I have it!
    This may seem presumptuous of me, but what of my own daughter? She is kindhearted and fair of face.${prompt}
  8015: She has perhaps been of marriageable age for a little longer than usual, as I pondered which house would be the best for her to marry into...${prompt}
  8016: Ahahaha! Halver, have you developed a sense of humor over the years?${prompt}
  8017: A sense of humor...? I assure you, I am most seriou--${prompt}
  8018: I never thought you were the type to indulge in comedy. You must entertain us with your jests at the next banquet.${prompt}
  8019: Now, as for Trion's preferences. This is quite a quandary, isn't it?${prompt}
  8020: '...${prompt}'
  8021: I'm well aware of Trion's taste in ladies.${prompt}
  8022: Prince Pieuje...${prompt}
  8023: My brother's predilections are obvious if you have spent as much time with him as I have.${prompt}
  8024: "Of course, who would know better than his own brother? \nWell? Out with it then, Pieuje.${prompt}"
  8025: My brother...${prompt}
  8026: He seems to think that a well-traveled, free-spirited adventurer would make the best partner for him.${prompt}
  8027: An adventurer! I must say, this is a surprise. I would have thought that a nobleman's daughter or the princess of a distant land would be more...${prompt}
  8028: |-
    Hmm, things have certainly changed since my day. Mayhap this is the best choice for him.
    Halver, continue this discussion with Pieuje and seek out a girl that matches Trion's interests.${prompt}
  8029: Pieuje, not a word of this to your brother. He will become obstinate if he finds that we have been having this discussion without his knowledge.${prompt}
  8030: Of course, Father. I am well aware of his stubbornness.${prompt}
  8031: '...And that is the predicament I am in.${prompt}'
  8032: ${name-player}. As I have explained, we are looking for a fitting bride for Crown Prince Trion.${prompt}

  8098: I should think that since you have so much traffic with adventurer types, you wouldn't have any problem finding a “lady” that fits this description. What say you? Will you do it?${prompt}
  8099: Naturally, you will be compensated for your troubles.${prompt}
  8100: |-
    What say you?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'll see what I can do.
    I don't have time to play matchmaker.${prompt}
  8101: Excellent. Be sure that you choose a person who is fit for a prince in personality as well as appearance.${prompt}
  8102: Bring the bride-to-be to me first and I shall decide if she is suitable for Prince Trion. I will also require your assistance during the introductions. Good luck in your search.${prompt}
  8103: Hmm, this is not a pressing matter so I will not force the issue. Speak to me again if you find yourself with idle hands and a will to serve the Kingdom.${prompt}
  8104: You have been unable to find a suitable bride for Prince Trion? Well, I will not ask you to do the impossible.${prompt}
  8105: |-
    Give up the search?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, this is impossible!
    No, the prince shall have his consort!${prompt}
  8106: I do not hold it against you. If a fitting bride is nowhere to be found, then there is little we can do. Forget this little task and return to your life, adventurer.${prompt}
  8107: I am counting on you, ${name-player}. Let me give you the description again, in case you have forgotten. According to Prince Pieuje...${prompt}
  8108: When you find someone matching the description, bring them here as a member of your party. Dismissed.${prompt}
  8109: The quest “Fit for a Prince” has been canceled.${prompt}
  8110: You have brought a lady who meets Prince Trion's preferences?${prompt}
  8111: Yes, this person certainly matches Prince Pieuje's description.${prompt}
  8112: |-
    And your name, madame?
    ${player: 0}, is it?
    ${player: 0} d'Oraguille... Hmm, passable.${prompt}

    And your name, madame?

    And your name, madame?
    ${player: 5}, is it?
    ${player: 5} d'Oraguille... Hmm, passable.${prompt}
  8118: We shall perform the introductions immediately. Come with me, and be on your best behavior.${prompt}
  8119: Not that you need overly worry. In private Prince Trion is a gentle soul, quite different from the stern face he presents to the world.${prompt}
  8120: Prince Trion!${prompt}
  8121: Hm? Oh, it's you, Halver. So rare to see you in this part of the chateau. Is there something that needs my attention?${prompt}
  8122: Yes, Your Highness. There is a lady I would like you to meet...${prompt}
  8123: A lady...? You mean a new guard for the courtyard, or some such?${prompt}
  8124: Ah, not exactly. If Your Highness would care to cast an eye this way?${prompt}
  8125: '...${prompt}'
  8126: And your appraisal, Your Highness?${prompt}
  8127: She appears to be an adventurer...?${prompt}
  8128: Yes, an adventurer hand-picked from the crowd, based on your preferences.${prompt}
  8129: |-
    My preferences?
    Halver, what in blazes are you talking about?${prompt}
  8130: |-
    You see, that is...
    I have found a lady suited to the Prince's tastes. His Majesty mentioned that you have reached an age where marriage should be a serious consideration.${prompt}
  8131: There is no need to be shy. Why not take a stroll around the gardens and become acquainted with one another? We will take our leave.${prompt}
  8132: |-
    So this is Father's doing...
    I do not recall speaking of my “preferences” to anyone, however...${prompt}
  8133: Prince Trion, you sent for me?${prompt}
  8134: |-
    C-Curilla...?
    What are you doing here?${prompt}
  8135: I was informed by Prince Pieuje that Your Highness wished to see me...${prompt}
  8136: |-
    What is the matter with you, Curilla? Can you not read the situation here!? Prince Trion and the lady here are on a “date.”
    Your presence is not required.${prompt}
  8137: A “date”?${prompt}
  8138: '!!!${prompt}'
  8139: You mean, Prince Trion and that girl are...?${prompt}
  8140: Yes, this may lead to a royal wedding. It would be best if we were to find pressing duties elsewhere.${prompt}
  8141: I humbly apologize for this intrusion, Your Highness. If there is nothing further, I shall return to my training. I need complete concentration to practice my sword techniques and would prefer not to be disturbed.${prompt}
  8142: |-
    Wait! Curilla...!
    This is not what you...!${prompt}
  8143: Finally, you two can spend some time together in peace.${prompt}
  8144: Halver...${prompt}
  8145: Please, Prince Trion, your gratitude should go to this adventurer. I am merely the messenger.${prompt}
  8146: Remove yourself from my presence right this minute, or your blood will stain my fist!${prompt}
  8147: Your Highness...? Is there something amiss?${prompt}
  8148: |-
    Silence! Get out of here, all of you!
    Halver! I never want to see your miserable face again!${prompt}
  8149: I have no idea why Prince Trion was so furious.${prompt}
  8150: Hahaha. This may just be the spur Trion needs.${prompt}
  8151: I do feel sorry for the Temple Knight who draws Curilla as a fencing partner, however.${prompt}
  8152: Unfortunately, it appears that Prince Trion was not pleased with our young lady. Do not take it to heart, as there is no accounting for taste, now is there?${prompt}
  8153: Please accept this gift from the Royal Household in appreciation of your efforts. I hope you will continue to offer your services to the Kingdom.${prompt}
  8154: I hope you will continue to offer your services to the Kingdom.${prompt}
  8155: You have been recommended by a party member as a potential consort for the crown prince. Please speak with Sir Halver in the main hall.${prompt}
  8156: '${choice: 0}[As there are no party members/As there are no female party members], you are unable to see this event.${prompt}'

    The minstrel of melodies is my name,
    For a mere ${number: 6} gil I'll recall your past.
    Your stories of love, anger, triumph, and shame,
    The river of memories runs deep and vast.${prompt}
  8160: |-
    The minstrel of melodies is my name,
    For a mere ${number: 6} gil I'd recall your past.
    But I find that you're lacking in cash or in fame,
    So until that time, my kind offer will last.${prompt}
  8161: Now close your eyes...${prompt}
  8162: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}!
    I am delighted to see you have shown interest in our fine exercise.${prompt}
  8163: I can assume you have already been informed of the finer details of Conflict, can I not?${prompt}
  8164: The three nations are finally at peace. Tension between the people of Vana'diel is the last thing any of us wish. However, while only a simple exercise, a game such as Ballista could be misinterpreted by some as a direct attack on an ally.${prompt}
  8165: That is where you adventurers come in. Your minds are still clear, your spirits fresh. You are not controlled by petty politics and hidden agendas. It is you who have the opportunity to become the true heroes of the Kingdom.${prompt}
  8166: Ah, but to think I would live to see the day Conflict was reinstated. Just thinking of the heated battle makes my heart race with excitement.${prompt}
  8167: When I was still young, I would spend my days training for Ballista with my fellow knights. Victory was the only thing on our minds.${prompt}
  8168: |-
    Knowing thy enemy and using that knowledge to strike him down...
    Giving your all till you have no more to give...
    The power of the spirit is what drives us, young ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8169: And when the battle is through, there remains no hate nor spite--only a bond between brothers that can be experienced through the silent, firm handshake exchanged before parting.${prompt}
  8170: |-
    You have my permission to take part in the games.
    My only regret is that due to my age, I will be unable to fight by your side.${prompt}
  8171: However, forget not during these exercises you will be bearing the emblem of the Kingdom. The honor of San d'Oria is at stake, so act accordingly.${prompt}
  8172: Defeat is not an option. I expect you to do your best, and I expect you to win.${prompt}
  8173: Hmmm...${prompt}
  8174: So you are the adventurer known as ${name-player}. It has come to my attention that you wish to participate in our battle exercises.${prompt}
  8175: Step closer and show me your face.${prompt}
  8176: '...${prompt}'
  8177: |-
    Hah hah hah!
    You truly do not think you can defeat my legions of seasoned fighters, do you?${prompt}
  8178: When I learned that adventurers from Bastok would be taking part in Conflict, I was looking forward to seeing what kind of brute warrior the Republic would send. But if this is all my Hume companions have to offer, I can be only more positive that the forces of San d'Oria will be victorious.${prompt}
  8179: In recent years our two nations have been on amicable terms. However, I do not feel that any of my loyal citizens have forgotten what transpired in the Konschtat Highlands.${prompt}
  8180: When I learned that adventurers from Windurst would be taking part in Conflict, I was looking forward to seeing what kind of mighty sorcerer the Federation would send. But if this is all my Tarutaru companions have to offer, I can be only more positive that the forces of San d'Oria will be victorious.${prompt}
  8181: In recent years San d'Oria and Windurst have been on amicable terms. However, I do not feel that any of my loyal citizens have forgotten the bitter history that stains our nations' past.${prompt}
  8182: Ballista is the perfect opportunity to help erase the unwanted feelings of spite between us. But this does not mean my Kingdom's forces will show pity to their opponents. I will grant you the opportunity to withdraw your participation, if you wish.${prompt}
  8183: '...I see that you have already made up your mind.${prompt}'
  8184: |-
    Understood.
    Speak with Excenmille in Northern San d'Oria. There you will receive your Conflict registration.${prompt}
  8185: You may have had success in previous battles, but the road that lies ahead is like nothing you have traveled before. Clear your heart and cast off all inhibitions, and you will go far.${prompt}

  8242: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  8243: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  8244: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  8245: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  8246: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  8247: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  8248: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  8249: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  8250: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  8251: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  8252: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  8253: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  8254: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  8255: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  8256: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  8257: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  8258: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  8259: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  8260: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  8261: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  8262: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  8263: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  8264: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'
  8265: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt}
  8266: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  8267: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  8268: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
  8269: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}

  8280: You wear a badge of the land of Aht Urhgan.${prompt}

    Prince Trion first made his way to Mhaura and passed himself off as an adventurer.${prompt}

    Dear Altana...
    A member of the royal family traipsing about as an “adventurer”...${prompt}
  8324: The court will be mortified.${prompt}

    Aht Urhgan!?
    And then?${prompt}
  8327: I quickly slipped aboard as well, and guarded the royal person from the shadows.${prompt}
  8328: The ferry safely arrived in Al Zahbi with the prince none the wiser of my presence.${prompt}
  8329: After entering the city, Prince Trion headed straight to a mercenary company and apparently signed some sort of contract.${prompt}
  8330: |-
    A contract!?
    Surely not with his own name? This could escalate into an international crisis!${prompt}
  8331: |-
    There is nothing to fear on that count.
    His Highness travels the Empire under the assumed name of “Raillefal.”${prompt}
  8332: So no one in Al Zahbi is aware of his true identity?${prompt}
  8333: |-
    I wouldn't say that, milord...
    The prince is wearing a suit of gilded gold plate and is not subtle in his information gathering.${prompt}
  8334: |-
    Great Goddess...
    Then he is not disguised at all?${prompt}
  8335: No, milord.${prompt}
  8336: Come to think of it, I have seen this adventurer's face in the very same mercenary company...${prompt}
  8337: This letter must be the very same document I witnessed in the prince's hand at the Shararat Teahouse.${prompt}
  8338: I am wounded that Prince Trion does not have more trust in us, his loyal subjects...${prompt}
  8339: And I do wish he would act with a little more discretion.${prompt}
  8340: That is a matter we shall discuss anon...${prompt}
  8341: First, we must learn the reason for Prince Trion's seemingly frequent trips to the nation of Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  8342: |-
    What is the current state of the Near East?
    Is the prince in any danger?${prompt}
  8343: Do not be concerned.${prompt}
  8344: |-
    I am sure that Travialce has learned much from following the prince.
    Please enlighten us.${prompt}
  8345: |-
    Sir.
    Raillefal...ah, Prince Trion, investigated the following facts.${prompt}
  8346: Four years ago, Jalzahn, the former Emperor of Aht Urhgan, and his wife both succumbed to the same illness...${prompt}
  8347: |-
    Yes, I remember...
    The Kingdom of San d'Oria sent her condolences.
    The illness was quite virulent, as I recall...${prompt}
  8348: The beastmen who dwell on the western borders of the nation used this as an opportunity to cease offering tributes.${prompt}
  8349: |-
    Hmph.
    What more would you expect from those savages?${prompt}
  8350: Though the Empire's long war with the eastern nations was at a stalemate, they could not afford to grow complacent.${prompt}
  8351: The main body of the Imperial Army remained focused on the east...${prompt}
  8352: Meanwhile, the beastmen of the Mamool Ja Savagelands and Halvung Territory unfurled a banner of rebellion on the abandoned western front. It was not long before they were joined by an army known as the “Undead Swarm”...${prompt}
  8353: The military might of San d'Oria is fully occupied with the Orcish horde alone. If it were three separate armies...${prompt}
  8354: Even a mighty nation like Aht Urhgan must flounder...${prompt}
  8355: |-
    Of a certain, sir.
    The capital itself has recently been the target of beastman invasions.${prompt}
  8356: Aht Urhgan now finds herself without the resources to even repair the walls of Al Zahbi...${prompt}
  8357: No matter how impressive a swordsman Prince Trion is, we cannot allow him to remain in such a dangerous place.${prompt}
  8358: I must take this matter up with those responsible for protecting the royal household.${prompt}
  8359: Bring me General Curilla!${prompt}
  8360: General Curilla. It appears a member of the Royal Knights has managed to track down the location of our wayward prince.${prompt}
  8361: And where, pray tell, would that be?${prompt}
  8362: The Empire of Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  8363: Aht Urhgan...${prompt}
  8364: The nation recruiting mercenaries?${prompt}
  8365: Yes.${prompt}
  8366: Then it stands to reason that the Temple Knights should stand little chance of finding the prince.${prompt}
  8367: I seem to recall ordering you to take measures that would prevent this sort of thing from happening again. Am I mistaken?${prompt}
  8368: |-
    No, Monarlais Halver.
    I have been derelict in my duty.${prompt}
  8369: It is good that you recognize your failings, but you shall be made to take responsibility for this situation.${prompt}
  8370: Yes, milord.${prompt}
  8371: Forgive my directness, Monarlais Halver, but I feel I must ask.${prompt}
  8372: Why would Prince Trion travel to such a distant land? Does he feel so strongly about the Empire?${prompt}
  8373: Prince Trion visited Al Zahbi once before, when the Emperor was yet hale and healthy.${prompt}
  8374: The incident that occurred is most likely connected to all this...${prompt}
  8375: ?${prompt}
  8376: However, now is not the time to be telling tales of the past.${prompt}
  8377: |-
    This matter has grown beyond the realm of our judgment.

  8380: |-
    How like Trion to rush off without so much as a word...
    He has earned a reputation for action before thought.${prompt}
  8381: |-
    Your Highness.
    This is the letter we believe to have been penned by your brother.${prompt}
  8382: Travialce may have provided enough keys to unlock this rambling script...${prompt}
  8383: This may require some time...${prompt}
  8384: |-
    Hmph. There is no need to convene a meeting of linguists, Halver.
    Let me see this letter.${prompt}
  8385: This time, my brother's actions may have a positive side...${prompt}
  8386: He writes on the current state of the Empire.${prompt}
  8387: We must turn our attention to the Near East, where a battle on the scale of the Crystal War is brewing...${prompt}
  8388: What on Vana'diel is happening over there...?${prompt}
  8389: |-
    There is an overwhelming reason for the beastman attacks on Al Zahbi.
    I will read to you what my brother has written, word for word.${prompt}
  8390: “At the center of this conflict is a treasure known as the Astral Candescence.${prompt}
  8391: “This object emits an enchanting melody, unheard by mortal ears.${prompt}
  8392: “The melody envelops and fills those nearby with a boundless energy, be they person or beastman.${prompt}
  8393: “The citizens of Al Zahbi call this melody the Astral Wind.”${prompt}
  8394: I believe I have come to understand Prince Trion's apprehensions.${prompt}
  8395: You are not alone in that feeling.${prompt}
  8396: Then we are in agreement.${prompt}
  8397: Halver, have messengers sent to the other nations immediately.${prompt}
  8398: We must convene an emergency meeting of the nations.${prompt}
  8399: |-
    Understood, Your Highness.
    And the location?${prompt}
  8400: |-
    The location...
    Send a request to Jeuno to secure a meeting room in the Grand Duke Palace.${prompt}
  8401: At once.${prompt}
  8402: |-
    Prince Pieuje.
    What shall be done about Prince Trion's frequent excursions outside of the Kingdom?${prompt}
  8403: I do not wish to be rude, but we are well aware of how the prince reacts to attempts to dissuade him from his course...${prompt}
  8404: That is true.${prompt}
  8405: Having the heir to the throne playing at being a mercenary will not improve San d'Oria's image in the eyes of the world.${prompt}
  8406: |-
    But the solution is simple.
    I shall write my brother a letter.${prompt}
  8407: A letter, Your Highness?${prompt}
  8408: |-
    Yes.
    I have an idea.${prompt}
  8409: But I shall need a volunteer to deliver it safely to Al Zahbi...${prompt}
  8410: I suggest Travialce. He is well versed in the geography of the region.${prompt}
  8411: |-
    Excellent.
    Let it be done.${prompt}
  8412: I will not fail you, Your Highness.${prompt}
  8413: |-
    Your Highness, this is ${name-player}.
    ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] brought Prince Trion's letter back from the Near East.${prompt}
  8414: |-
    Is that so?
    I do not approve of my brother's rash actions, but he does have an eye for trustworthy messengers.${prompt}
  8415: |-
    ${name-player}.
    I am sure you are exhausted from your long journey, but your presence will be required at the meeting in Jeuno.${prompt}
  8416: We may have need of your testimony.${prompt}
  8417: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Arrangements for the meeting will be made in all haste.${prompt}
  8418: Make your way to Jeuno as soon as your preparations are complete.${prompt}
  8419: I never thought the situation to be this grave...${prompt}
  8420: |-
    Well met, friend. I am Temple Knight Rembard.
    My duty is the issuance of marriage certificates to lawfully wedded couples.${prompt}
  8421: How may I serve you this day?${prompt}
  8422: |-
    Marriage certificates are legally binding documents issued in recognition of the matrimony of the two individuals named therein.
    They may also adorn the wall of your Mog House.${prompt}
  8423: Those wishing to receive this document must present proof of their marriage in the manner I shall now explain.${prompt}
  8424: |-
    The couple should form a party while the husband is equipped with his ${color: 5}matrimony ring${color: 1}, and his wife, her ${color: 5}matrimony band${color: 1}.
    Thence, speak to me, and I shall prepare the certificates without delay.${prompt}
  8425: 'Alternatively, should you have a ${color: 5}wedding ring${color: 1} in your possession, it is possible to request issuance without your partner present.${prompt}'
  8426: |-
    Please bear in the mind, though, that one person cannot possess multiple certificates at any given time.
    Furthermore, the nation of issuance for the certificate you hold cannot differ from that of your spouse.${prompt}
  8427: Lastly, the re-issuance of a misplaced certificate can be carried out solely by the officiating body wherefrom it was originally issued.${prompt}
  8428: A wedding is a joyous event wherein two souls brought together by fate are joined in an everlasting union.${prompt}
  8429: San d'Orian tradition holds that the bride and groom, each with weapon in hand, swear an oath of lifelong loyalty to each other before the goddess Altana.${prompt}
  8430: 'Wedding rings--a ${color: 5}matrimony ring${color: 1} and a ${color: 5}matrimony band${color: 1}, to be precise--are required.${prompt}'
  8431: These rings, which require rare and ofttimes elusive ingredients for synthesis, symbolize a couple's undying devotion to each other.${prompt}
  8432: 'Prior to presenting the ring to your partner, it is common practice to engrave one''s name onto it using such items as ${color: 5}cyclone crystals${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  8433: '${color: 5}Wedding dresses${color: 1} and ${color: 5}benedight coats${color: 1} popularly serve as ceremonial attire for men and women, respectively.${prompt}'
  8434: |-
    While garments like in form and function can be synthesized, the procurement of ingredients to make them presents quite a challenge. It is precisely for this reason, however, that significance is lent to their donning in ceremonies.
    Some adventurers perform the synthesis themselves, while others prefer to entrust the task to a friend.${prompt}
  8435: |-
    Be not disheartened, though, should the garments be not within your means.
    No law dictates how couples must attire themselves in a wedding ceremony.${prompt}
  8436: Should you encounter difficulty obtaining any of the ceremonial items mentioned thus far, they can also be purchased from the chests you see before you.${prompt}
  8437: |-
    Such items as fireworks and ${color: 5}wedding bells${color: 1} are also available to assist you in enhancing the atmosphere of revelry.
    You may purchase them as you see fit.${prompt}
  8438: |-
    It seems you already have a marriage certificate in your possession.
    I am not authorized to issue you another.${prompt}
  8439: 'Your current job level must needs be level ${number: 2} or greater if you wish to be issued a marriage certificate.${prompt}'
  8440: You are not eligible to receive a marriage certificate.${prompt}
  8441: 'Legally wedded couples wishing to receive marriage certificates should form a party while the husband is equipped with his ${color: 5}matrimony ring${color: 1}, and his wife, her ${color: 5}matrimony band${color: 1}. Thence, speak to the official in charge, and the certificates shall be prepared for you without delay.${prompt}'
  8442: |-
    It appears you have previously been issued a marriage certificate by another nation.
    The re-issuance of a misplaced certificate can be carried out solely by the officiating body wherefrom it was originally issued.${prompt}
  8443: It appears your spouse's marriage certificate was issued by another nation.${prompt}
  8444: |-
    It appears your spouse's marriage certificate was issued by another nation.
    To obtain one of your own, you must request issuance from the same officiating body as your spouse.${prompt}
  8445: |-
    Accepting a marriage certificate from our nation will render you ineligible to receive one from another.
    Furthermore, the nation of issuance for the certificate you hold cannot differ from that of your partner's.${prompt}
  8446: Accepting a marriage certificate from our nation will render you ineligible to receive one from another.${prompt}
  8447: By the power vested in me by the Church of San d'Oria, I hereby pronounce you husband and wife.${prompt}
  8448: May the glory and fortunes of war be with you.${prompt}

    Beg your pardon, my lord.
    Would you by any chance...remember us?${prompt}
  8460: Hm? Who are you and what business have you within Chateau d'Oraguille?${prompt}
  8461: Awww...${prompt}
  8462: |-
    My companion and I are, um...simple adventurers hungry for knowledge.
    If my lord could spare the time, we wish to learn about the Battle of Xarcabard.${prompt}
  8463: Ah, your request is as music to my ears, young lady. The youth of today show precious little interest in the events of the past...the sacrifices that many made to ensure the continued existence of our fair Kingdom.${prompt}
  8464: |-
    Naught would give me greater pleasure than to share all I know.
    Now then, where shall we begin?${prompt}
  8465: Ah, yes. Sir Ragelise B Baloumat, the hero of the Battle of Xarcabard. 'Tis a name I recall well.${prompt}
  8466: Sadly, though, I am given to understand that none in his unit, the Ironcrest Hawks, survived to return home.${prompt}
  8467: Such a grueling battle it must have been...${prompt}
  8468: Wait. I once was told of a man who religiously visited Sir Ragelise's grave out in Batallia Downs.${prompt}
  8469: '!!!${prompt}'
  8470: I've no notion as to the identity of that individual, but it might well serve to seek him out.${prompt}
  8471: Thank you, my lord!${prompt}
  8472: ${name-player}! Let's make haste to Batallia Downs!${prompt}
  8473: A moment.${prompt}
  8474: Yes, my lord.${prompt}
  8475: The resemblance you bear to someone I fought beside during the war is...truly striking. An endearing young lady she was, with such strength of spirit as would make one believe naught was beyond hope.${prompt}
  8476: |-
    'Tis merely but a trick of the mind, surely, for two decades have passed since then.
    Were we to meet this day, she would stand before me a stately matron.${prompt}
  8477: Press confirm to proceed.${prompt}
  8478: '　　 ${wait-animation: 1}'
  8479: Halt! You'd best have a good reason for skulking about Castle d'Oraguille, rabble!${prompt}
  8480: A letter? Hand that over this instant!${prompt}
  8481: |-
    I shall return in a moment.
    Wander not an ilm from where you stand!${prompt}
  8482: |-
    Monarlais Halver will see you.
    To the castle with you at once, and no detours!${prompt}
  8483: |-
    Well met, ${name-player}.
    How fare you these days?${prompt}
  8484: A letter? And this seal...${prompt}
  8485: |-
    ...So the serpent would seek the aid of the lion. A curious turn of events, indeed.
    I must deliver this to my king at once. Come along.${prompt}

    ...So the serpent would seek the aid of the lion. A curious turn of events, indeed.
    I must deliver this to my king at once. Come along.${prompt}
  8487: An iron giant with the power to smite an airship from the sky, and a young Empress who would nonetheless seek to restore its power...${prompt}
  8488: '...${prompt}'
  8489: I would hear your counsel, Halver.${prompt}
  8490: Your Highness. I must confess, my heart misgives me as to the wisdom of this endeavor...${prompt}
  8491: Halver...!${prompt}
  8492: This is the selfsame Empire, after all, that not so long ago did wield the power of this colossus against this Kingdom and our allies.${prompt}
  8493: |-
    That said, they have since made amends, and we have accepted their formal apology.
    To hold past misdeeds against them now would be most...unchivalrous...of us, would it not?${prompt}
  8494: '...And yet the past cannot be so readily forgotten.${prompt}'
  8495: Begging your pardon, my prince. I daresay that the mere fact that they seek our consent--rather than engaging in devious and furtive plots--shows that we deal no longer with the Silent Empire of old.${prompt}
  8496: |-
    Settle yourself, Halver.
    I said nothing of denying their plea.${prompt}
  8497: Forgive me, my prince. I spoke in haste.${prompt}
  8498: It is precisely because I remember well the past that I believe the Empire's plea to be sincere.${prompt}
  8499: |-
    It is clear that this Empress Nashmeira truly intends to lead her nation to a new age.
    I have no doubt that she will prove a staunch ally worthy of our trust.${prompt}
  8500: Oho! Never did I think this day would come, but I must say...my brother has the right of it.${prompt}
  8501: Besides, were something to go amiss, the presence of ${name-player} here should suffice to keep matters in hand.${prompt}
  8502: I could not agree more, my king.${prompt}
  8503: ${name-player} has served the Kingdom with loyalty and valor time and again.${prompt}
  8504: I, too, can vouch for this, Father.${prompt}

    Halver and my sons present a compelling case.
    Return to this Empress, and tell her San d'Oria stands with her.
    Now farewell, and may the Goddess watch over your journey!${prompt}

    Halver and my son present a compelling case.
    Return to this Empress, and tell her San d'Oria stands with her.
    Now farewell, and may the Goddess watch over your journey!${prompt}
  8511: Greetings, ${name-player}. I must say, that outfit truly becomes you.${prompt}
  8512: Well met, adventurer. I must say, that outfit truly becomes you.${prompt}
  8513: You should know that your exploits have impressed many a knight, so much so that those have emerged who would forsake their Kingdom for an unfettered life. It troubles me to imagine a San d'Oria bereft of those who would charge into battle in her defense.${prompt}
  8514: But I digress. After all, is now not the time for celebration?${prompt}
  8515: |-
    I had prepared a letter to send to the moogles, but duties to the crown had not afforded me the time to have it dispatched.
    But if I might be forgiven for my impropriety, I would proffer it to you here and now.${prompt}
  8516: Ah, yes. I must depart for the Duchy to seek counsel regarding the knights...${prompt}
  8517: Yes? Have you business with me?${prompt}
  8518: |-
    Ah, 'tis you. When last we conversed, you were searching for a certain Crystal War veteran.
    Were you able to find who you sought?${prompt}
  8519: You were? That is pleasing news indeed. More pleasing still to know that you can turn to him again should the need arise.${prompt}
  8520: Hm? Your companion appears not to be with you today.${prompt}
  8521: '...Or have I confused you with another?${prompt}'
  8522: Pray forgive me. Keeping vigil here day after day, my mind is wont to wander on occasion.${prompt}
  8523: Were you able to find who you sought?${prompt}
  8524: Hail! I am Curilla V Mecru, general of the Temple Knights. Our order is charged with protecting Chateau d'Oraguille and the city itself from any forces that would seek to cause chaos inside our fair realm.${prompt}
  8525: 'Is this...${keyitem-article: 1[2]}?${prompt}'
  8526: Yes, it is true that I am a participant in this Trust magic experiment, but I do not recall forming any sort of bond with you.${prompt}
  8527: 'Perhaps it would behoove you to further serve ${choice: 5}[your homeland/San d''Oria] before coming to see me.${prompt}'
  8528: |-
    What do you wish today?
    Oh, you have ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}? I see...${prompt}
  8529: So you have succeeded in drawing forth Trust magic, then.${prompt}
  8530: No, I cannot admit to being surprised. A ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] of your talents is capable of much in these dark times.${prompt}
  8531: Let me guess--you wish to see if you can summon my alter ego, do you not?${prompt}
  8532: |-
    Attempt the ritual with Curilla?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  8533: I must confess, my heart is not in this, either. Prince Trion insisted that I participate, though, and I cannot deny him.${prompt}
  8534: Both Prince Trion and the Jeuno Institute of Magical Studies had the same words for me when this experiment began.${prompt}
  8535: “Think of the glory, Curilla.” Yet to be honest, I am quite unsure of myself.${prompt}
  8536: I fear my skills are yet inferior. What good can an alter ego be when the original remains weak?${prompt}
  8537: Try as I might, I cannot help but picture people pointing and laughing as I falter. A leader who cannot command respect is no better than a king with no country.${prompt}
  8538: And further, I have never been one to fight for fame or personal gain. Not since I lost my eye in exchange for victory in the tourneys.${prompt}
  8539: I recall discussing this with you when I asked you to bring me water from the spring atop Horlais Peak.${prompt}
  8540: And further, fame and personal gain are worldly pleasures which I do not need.${prompt}
  8541: You proffer that I should think not of glory, but of...helping others?${prompt}
  8542: '...You are correct, of course. Yet another sign that I have much to learn.${prompt}'
  8543: Now that I think about it, my father, Rainemard, certainly taught you one of life's most valuable lessons.${prompt}
  8544: “A true warrior does not shirk from defeat.”${prompt}
  8545: You were there, right by my side. We rode to victory on a chariot fashioned from your courage.${prompt}
  8546: '${choice: 2}[Now that I think about it,/I''m also reminded of when] you brandished the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, working to better yourself and succeeding admirably.${prompt}'
  8547: I can still picture being reprimanded by Pieuje for being overzealous.${prompt}
  8548: But your success and knowing the extent of your determination certainly lessened the sting a palpable degree.${prompt}
  8549: 'You ${choice: 2}[/also ]gave your all in the Royal Family''s time of need.${prompt}'
  8550: I would ask of you yet one further favor to add to my many debts--please, continue to protect the people of San d'Oria. There is much here that only one of your caliber could recognize.${prompt}
  8551: You know what I would like most of all? To challenge you once more in valiant combat, like we did back in Delkfutt's Tower.${prompt}
  8552: You were a couple steps ahead of me then. I wonder how we would match up today.${prompt}
  8553: I will even forgive you for introducing that lovely woman to Prince Trion.${prompt}
  8554: Why would you need my forgiveness?${prompt}
  8555: W-wait! I-it is not what you think!${prompt}
  8556: |-
    ${choice: 4}[Anyway/A-anyway], let us return to the subject of Trust. I will consent to engaging in this ritual with you.
    Please, close your eyes...${prompt}
  8557: A grand success! Perhaps now I can repay my debt to you and the citizens of this great nation.${prompt}
  8558: May our paths cross again and our friendship deepen further.${prompt}
  8559: Who goes there?${prompt}
  8560: Ah, ${name-player}! I did not expect your presence this day.${prompt}
  8561: 'You need not say more. ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 1[2]} has found its way into your possession, has it not?${prompt}'
  8562: The natural conclusion, then, is that you desire that my alter ego accompany you into battle.${prompt}
  8563: I must admit the idea is not without merit.${prompt}
  8564: My responsibilities here at the chateau have kept me overlong from the front lines. How I long to remind San d'Oria's enemies to fear the name Trion I d'Oraguille!${prompt}
  8565: Yet both needs may be served. While I tend to my duties here, my alter ego may mete out justice abroad. What say you? Will you have me as a companion in your crusades?${prompt}
  8566: |-
    Crusade with Prince Trion?
    ${selection-lines}
    Let the lion of San d'Oria roar!
    Eh, go back to doing paperwork.${prompt}
  8567: Hahahaha, perhaps one day my penmanship will match my swordsmanship. Fair enough, ${name-player}, but return to me if ever your mind changes.${prompt}
  8568: Hahahaha, the Dragon King himself could not have said it better!${prompt}
  8569: Still, I would have you know I did not join this “Trust” initiative merely in the pursuit of personal glory.${prompt}
  8570: I am a son of the House d'Oraguille, and ever have the interests of San d'Oria and her citizens been foremost in my mind.${prompt}
  8571: But why should others throughout the rest of the world remain unguided? No, I must work to ensure that those of all upbringings are free from tyranny!${prompt}
  8572: Alas, attending affairs abroad means neglecting affairs of state...or so I thought. The institute's announcement has granted me a means to be in multiple places at once.${prompt}
  8573: However, there are those of my house who have balked at the suggestion.${prompt}
  8574: Though it was by the hands of adventurers that the Shadow Lord met his demise, it would be unseemly for one of royal lineage to be seen under the employ of one who spends weeks on end defecating in the woods.${prompt}
  8575: Thus, I have one stipulation to which you must assent before we proceed further.${prompt}
  8576: You are never to forget that when we fight together, the dawning sun gleaming before us, I am the one who is in command.${prompt}
  8577: That should silence those in opposition.${prompt}
  8578: And if they continue to howl, I shall remind them of how it was you who brought peace to San d'Oria.${prompt}
  8579: Perhaps then they will recall the incident of the Lightbringer. Without your intervention, our house would doubtlessly have been more shamed than anything I could personally do.${prompt}
  8580: 'I must${choice: 2}[/ also] tell them in great detail about your activities in Aht Urhgan.${prompt}'
  8581: |-
    What I saw with these two eyes...
    No, I did not see for myself. I heard about your good work from a trusted source.${prompt}
  8582: '${choice: 2}[If that fails to sway them, I shall detail/Your exploits go further. I could never forget] the time when you lent the knights your aid in their quest to hunt down a traitor selling information to the Orcs.${prompt}'
  8583: That Vilbert would prey on a man whose mother was infirm...a swift death was too kind an end for him.${prompt}
  8584: |-
    This Trust magic...
    Is it true that it is based upon the bonds that tie us? If so, is it these kinds of emotions that make it stronger?${prompt}
  8585: |-
    ${choice: 2}[Should they not understand, I will have to try something else./But let us leave that aside.]
    I'm reminded of another time...${prompt}
  8586: A time when you brought a female adventurer here with you, claiming she would make a perfect queen.${prompt}
  8587: Should the ceremony succeed, do not even think of pulling a stunt like that with my alter ego.${prompt}
  8588: And should Curilla catch even one whiff of it...my fist will be covered in the blood of a certain meddling ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who shall remain nameless.${prompt}
  8589: '${choice: 2}[If they fail to understand, I shall mention how/And one other thing. I would be remiss to mention the time when] our paths crossed under more...antagonistic circumstances.${prompt}'
  8590: “Antagonistic” may be a bit extreme--but it does describe the feelings I harbored toward you when you bested me in the Stellar Fulcrum. 'Twas truly a match well fought.${prompt}
  8591: But enough reminiscing. Though our discussion has been a fruitful one, my country calls for me to serve.${prompt}
  8592: Let us engage in this ritual quickly, and pray for success.${prompt}
  8593: |-
    Allow me to congratulate us both on our efforts. What is impossible for one becomes merely a trifle for two.
    My alter ego will gladly accompany you in combat--just never forget who is in command.${prompt}
  8594: Ah, but you have more you wish to discuss?${prompt}
  8595: The young woman Lion? Yes, she was here not that long ago, head full of questions.${prompt}
  8596: She was quite persistent in seeking an audience with Prince Trion, raving about Orc army formations and demanding to speak with the Royal Knights.${prompt}
  8597: A presumptuous young lady, to be sure. And without even a letter of invitation! Still, I tried my best to remain cordial as I rebuffed her.${prompt}
  8598: But that spark in her eyes was not something one crosses every day. Perhaps there was some kernel of truth in there, I reasoned, and sent agents of my own to investigate.${prompt}

  8605: '...I must admit that the consulate of ${choice: 2}[/Bastok/Windurst] has filed a formal complaint about me issuing demanding edicts to those who are not yet ready.${prompt}'
  8606: But if there were more capable personnel around, perhaps I would not have to.${prompt}
  8607: Let me give you something to further the cause.${prompt}
  8608: Oho! 'Tis always a pleasure to see you, ${name-player}. Come, there is something I must give you.${prompt}
  8609: This scroll contains an essence of my being. Those participating in the Trust initiative can use it to call forth my alter ego.${prompt}
