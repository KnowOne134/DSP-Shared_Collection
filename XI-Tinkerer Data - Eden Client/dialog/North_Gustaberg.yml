    Donating crystals.
    Conquest points.
    The effects of controlling regions.
    Regions controlled by other nations.
    Regions under beastman control.${prompt}
  7488: All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt}
  7489: Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt}
  7490: Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt}
  7491: So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt}
  7492: |-
    Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.
    They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt}
  7493: Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt}
  7494: Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt}
  7495: |-
    So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.
    We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt}
  7496: |-
    You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.
    Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt}
  7497: |-
    Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.
    The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt}
  7498: |-
    You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  7499: |-
    We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  7500: |-
    You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.
    Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt}
  7501: Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt}
  7502: |-
    You also receive rank points for completing missions.
    Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt}
  7503: |-
    You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.
    Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}
  7504: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt}
  7505: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt}
  7506: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt}
  7507: Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt}
  7508: Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt}
  7509: Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt}
  7510: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt}
  7511: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt}
  7512: |-
    Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.
    If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt}
  7513: If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt}
  7514: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt}
  7515: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt}
  7516: There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt}
  7517: |-
    Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.

    Oh.
    You must be this one's new owner.${prompt}

  7920: |-
    Splendid!
    From this day forth, I belong to you.${prompt}

    Well, this is most encouraging!

    This must be some sort of joke.
    You are the new wielder of this weapon?${prompt}

    Hmmm, perhaps I have misjudged you.
    With your level of skill, you may be able to handle this beastly blade, and have the will to control its awesome power.${prompt}
  7939: However, this is a magical blade. It is a sword that calls upon destruction. Its malice will gnaw away at your body and soul even as you topple enemies with its strength.${prompt}
  7940: |-
    Do not forget this truth! Keep it always in your mind.
    My regards go with you, stranger...${prompt}

  7948: |-
    Ah, now I see.
    The wheel has turned.${prompt}

    ...
    This is...Jeuno!?

  7959: |-
    I... Nobody can see me.
    This is merely a reflection of reality.
    Which means you are the one to inherit the axe.${prompt}
  7960: 'Hmm. With your polished skills, you will make a fine master for ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  7961: The one who wields this axe must also be beautiful to look upon. Apparently, I was a suitable candidate. Do you not agree?${prompt}
  7962: |-
    Congratulations.
    I expect you to perform great deeds from this day onwards.
    I also ask that someday you use ${item-singular: 0[2]} to avenge the Hydra Corps...${prompt}

  7966: |-
    ...
    You have found me.${prompt}
  7967: My forbidden power is now yours, and I am liberated from my prison.${prompt}

  7969: Such a long dream I was having...${prompt}
  7970: |-
    It was a dream held captive by a shrouded world.
    No. I must accept that it was no dream.${prompt}
  7971: |-
    And you? Do you seek the same darkness that I did...
    It seems you have already found your way to ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  7972: |-
    Very well, I will pass it on to you.
    But do not forget how much blood your companions spilled in your search for its unholy strength.${prompt}
  7973: And think long and hard on whether or not this power should be used. Do not end up like me...${prompt}
  7974: '...${prompt}'
  7975: |-
    Heh. Heh heh.
    Hahahahahahaha!${prompt}
  7976: |-
    Well, my new master, is it not time to begin the journey for ever greater power?
    There are enemies yet to fell, and blood yet to spill...${prompt}
  7977: |-
    ...
    You have unearthed me at last.${prompt}
  7978: I am free from Dynamis, free to fly through the heavens once more.${prompt}

    Hello?
    Is it possible that I...${prompt}
  7981: |-
    But, no.
    I have not returned to this realm...
    You. You are to be my successor?${prompt}
  7982: 'You certainly seem to have the required skill with the lance. Enough to convince ${item-singular: 0[2]} to lend you its power, at any rate.${prompt}'
  7983: Having this spear on the battlefield makes you a match for almost any opponent.${prompt}
  7984: |-
    Think well on what this means, and on how a weapon like this should be used.
    You have my admiration, adventurer. You have done well...${prompt}
  7985: '...${prompt}'
  7986: The ceremony of inheritance is complete.${prompt}
  7987: It is time for you to go forth and experience my overwhelming strength...${prompt}

    I have been rediscovered at last.${prompt}
  7989: Thanks to you, I have made my escape from the shrouded land.${prompt}
  7990: You must now gain the sanction of my master...${prompt}
  7991: It is a pity, indeed.${prompt}
  7992: This day has come far too soon for my liking.${prompt}
  7993: |-
    However, you are a master of the ninja trade.
    I concede that you will make a fitting wielder of the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  7994: |-
    Take this blade as your own.
    Travel far down the path of the ninja.${prompt}
  7995: I will be watching you from the shadows...${prompt}
  7996: '...${prompt}'
  7997: A fine master...${prompt}
  7998: My keen edge is now yours to wield. A sharpness said to make even demons wail...${prompt}
  7999: |-
    ...
    This day has finally come.${prompt}
  8000: |-
    I am to be released to this world for the first time in an age.
    Is this reason to celebrate, or despair...?${prompt}
  8001: In any event...${prompt}
  8002: What is going on here?${prompt}
  8003: Ah, my successor has come.${prompt}
  8004: 'I sought to master the way of the samurai, and traveled to the Far East for training. By the time I had gained the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and returned to my home, the Great War had begun.${prompt}'
  8005: When I think on it, my life has been a long road of trials. But to see the arrival of my successor makes me feel that all has not been in vain.${prompt}
  8006: |-
    You have my gratitude.
    Farewell, ${item-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt}
  8007: '...${prompt}'
  8008: It has been a hard path to reach this point.${prompt}
  8009: |-
    But your journey in the way of the samurai has just begun.
    You have yet to attain perfection.
    Let us continue your training...${prompt}
  8010: |-
    ...
    At long last, you have arrived.${prompt}
  8011: I was not convinced you were serious about completing this trial...${prompt}
  8012: You have proven me wrong...${prompt}
  8013: I have heard of your coming.${prompt}
  8014: You are to be the new master of this hammer of war?${prompt}
  8015: |-
    Every time ${item-singular: 0[2]} is reborn it gains a new wielder, who ultimately must pass it on to a successor.
    I have swung this hammer for more than eight hundred years. I never wished to part with it.${prompt}
  8016: "However, there is little meaning in me keeping it now. \nIf you will wield this weapon for a just cause, I hand its power over to you.${prompt}"
  8017: |-
    Now, take the hammer and go!
    Just be careful with how you handle it.
    Do not let its might crush you as well...${prompt}
  8018: '...${prompt}'
  8019: My might is yours to wield.${prompt}
  8020: Go forth and experience the destructive power that laid low the Earth Serpent...${prompt}
  8021: |-
    ...
    So, you have found me.${prompt}
  8022: |-
    I must give you my thanks.
    I have been freed from the hell of Dynamis and can regain my true power once again.${prompt}
  8023: And now...${prompt}
  8024: Hwaah!${prompt}
  8025: Just when I thought I had finally returned to this world, I find you standing here, ready to snatch my precious staff away.${prompt}
  8026: |-
    Well, it's for the best, I suppose.
    In my current state, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is nothing more than an ornament, its power going to waste.${prompt}
  8027: |-
    I entrust this staff to you!
    Take up ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${name-player}, and bind it to you in a contract of blood!${prompt}
  8028: |-
    I take my leave of you now.
    I only wish that I was able to stay a little longer...${prompt}
  8029: '...${prompt}'
  8030: I am yours to wield.${prompt}
  8031: |-
    But you are not yet my master.
    By watching your actions from this time onwards, I will decide if you are worthy of the title...${prompt}
  8032: |-
    ...
    You have discovered my resting place.${prompt}
  8033: |-
    The prison of souls has let loose its shackles, and I am free to loose arrows in this world once more.
    My thanks.${prompt}
  8034: Ah, one more test of your patience...${prompt}
  8035: Where is this place?${prompt}
  8036: |-
    Of course. How could I forget.
    I am Ghebben. I was entrusted with this bow by a warrior of the Far East.${prompt}
  8037: |-
    Your hands tell me that your skill in archery is far from ordinary.
    ${item-singular: 0[2]} will fit snugly into your sure grasp.${prompt}
  8038: |-
    However, this bow belongs to Sir Nasu, the warrior of whom I spoke.
    You must remember that you are merely its keeper for a time.${prompt}
  8039: Farewell...${prompt}
  8040: '...${prompt}'
  8041: |-
    It is an honor to be owned by a just master.
    Sir Ghebben was a truly splendid archer.${prompt}
  8042: |-
    You are now the one to draw me in battle.
    I will be at your side on any road you choose to travel, along with the destructive power of my arrows.${prompt}
  8043: |-
    ...
    We finally meet.${prompt}
  8044: I am now free from the pit of Dynamis to spit fire in this world once again.${prompt}
  8045: But I must ask you to wait before taking me into your possession...${prompt}
  8046: |-
    Why'd you have to go and wake me up? I was having the most relaxing sleep.
    Oh, this place looks familiar...${prompt}
  8047: Hm? You think you're the one who's going to take up my gun?${prompt}
  8048: 'You do seem to have a fair eye for marksmanship. And ${item-singular: 0[2]} would look perfect nestled in the crook of your arm...${prompt}'
  8049: Well, I have no more use for this weapon, so I guess you can have it. But there is one thing I want you to remember.${prompt}
  8050: This gun is a fearsome weapon that unleashes a blast upon your enemies many thousands of times greater in strength than the tiny effort it takes you to pull the trigger. Needless to say, be careful who you aim it at...${prompt}
  8051: '...${prompt}'
  8052: A weapon has no will of its own. But it was made for a purpose.${prompt}
  8053: Take me to a new battlefield, a new arena for the hunt...${prompt}
  8054: |-
    ...
    I am saved.${prompt}
  8055: Silenced for too long in the prison of Dynamis, I can once again let my brazen call echo through this land!${prompt}
  8056: A few more moments, if you please...${prompt}
  8057: |-
    Hello there.
    I am Terounalivet, a military musician of the Hydra Corps.${prompt}
  8058: |-
    You've never heard of me?
    Before joining the army I was quite the famous bard, mobbed by fans in every town I passed through.${prompt}
  8059: 'To be completely truthful, I am heartbroken to be giving up the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the most famous of instruments, even to a fellow bard.${prompt}'
  8060: But an instrument only shows its true worth when being played. This horn should be delighted to be passed on to such a talent as yourself.${prompt}
  8061: She has a capricious soul, but do treat her well. And do not forget that even without a raging battle, you can still play a tune for the simple enjoyment of those around you...${prompt}
  8062: '...${prompt}'
  8063: He was a wonderful performer.${prompt}

    We'd be much obliged if you could help us rustle up these buffalo, pardner.
    Go talk to my compadre by the city gates if yer interested.

    Here we've got a special beverage made from buffalo milk, with a dash o' moogle magic.

    There's big trouble, kupo!
    Our most reliable moogle intelligence reports that an odious one-eyed demon known as a Pyracmon is using the Harvest Festival masquerade as a cover and trying to infiltrate the city even as we speak!${prompt}
  8289: |-
    We've been trying to warn people, but the bigwigs and guardsmen won't even give us poor little moogles the time of day.

    Oh well, looks like it's going back in storage until next year, kupo.${prompt}
  8292: |-
    Splendid, kupo!
    The first thing you'll need to do is eliminate the Pyracmon's malevolent minions, the wraith bats!${prompt}
  8293: |-
    These dastardly critters attacked us and sucked the moogle magic right out of us, kupo!
    Without it, even the sharpest steel won't so much as scratch the Pyracmon!${prompt}
  8294: For each bat you banish, we'll recover some of our magical powers, so lay waste to as many flying foes as you can muster!${prompt}
  8295: Report back here after that, and we'll channel that magic and whip up an incantation that will allow you to vanquish the Pyracmon!${prompt}

    Wow, looks like you managed to recover oodles of magic from those bats. Oodles, kupo!
    This should make for a potent incantation indeed!${prompt}
  8302: |-
    Mind you, this enchantment won't last forever; if it runs out, you'll need to nab some more magic from the bats again.
    Now go send that ghastly Pyracmon back to the foul depths whence it came!${prompt}
  8303: |-
    Well, I'm sure a mighty adventurer like you has better things to do than help a poor little Moogle, kupo...
    Still, the Pyracmon won't rest until he's carried out his nefarious deeds, so do come back if you have a change of heart!${prompt}
  8304: |-
    Wow, you made mincemeat out of that Pyracmon! Just watching the battle sent chills up my little wings, kupo!
    You're the savior of the town and of all mooglekind!${prompt}
  8305: Though it may be unworthy of a great hero such as yourself, please accept this as a humble token of our moogle gratitude!${prompt}
  8306: |-
    For all we know, the Pyracmon is still lurking, just waiting for another chance to creep into our ranks.
    Should it return, please lend us your strength again, kupo!${prompt}
  8307: By the by, have you heard that some eerie and enchanting effulgences have emerged around the realm, kupo?${prompt}

    Each one mumbles and mutters like a misanthropic miscreant, but pay them no mind.
    Well now, may mirth and merriment multiply for you during this celebratory season, kupo!${prompt}

    My, my, my...
    What an intriguing spell you've learned, wayfarer.${prompt}
  8310: |-
    Yi-yi-yikes!
    Another pernicious puppet of Pyracmon is poised to pulverize us, kupo!${prompt}
  8311: |-
    Pyracmon?
    Hmm, that moniker may be gathering dust in the corner of my mind, but I do still recall it...possibly from some brittle tome written eons ago.${prompt}
  8312: It's the exorcist who made a deal with a de--${prompt}
  8313: |-
    Yes, yes, yes...now I remember.
    It is the name of a youthful yet promising exorcist who formed a perilous pact with a demon, only to become one himself.${prompt}
  8314: |-
    An exorcist who...hey! Don't put the chocobo before the cart!
    I don't remember selling my soul to a demon like that ecclesiastical abomination!${prompt}
  8315: |-
    Of course, but let us not dwell on trifling details.
    You there, adventurer. How about bestowing that boon upon us in a deal of your own? We shall certainly make it worth your while.${prompt}
  8316: |-
    Ay yai yai!
    I ardently advise against accepting an appeal as artful as this, kupo! You sobbed sanguineous streams in your quest to procure this potent magic--you shouldn't just give it away!${prompt}
  8317: |-
    Bestow the boon upon yon bats?
    ${selection-lines}
    Verily.
    Nay.${prompt}
  8318: How thoughtful of you to grace us with your presence--and your magic--yet again.${prompt}
  8319: |-
    I've never seen anyone go about business as slow as you! Was your mother a tortoise or something?
    Anyway, hurry up and give us that magic effect before we die of old age!${prompt}
  8320: |-
    That spell...equivalent to ${number: 0} mandragora-power...
    We must have it.${prompt}
  8321: |-
    What an exhilarating sensation! That last batch of magic was as potent as an Ahriman in rut.
    Should you chance to find yourself with a sorcerous abundance again, we will always welcome you with spread wings.${prompt}
  8322: |-
    I just know you're holding out on us, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt...for now.
    Next time, try stocking up on more of that magic first.${prompt}
  8323: |-
    I knew you'd give us what we needed.
    Have this in return.${prompt}
  8324: Sordid scryers, ${name-player}! You just parted ways with all the magnificent magic you managed to muster, kupo!${prompt}
  8325: |-
    Well...I suppose there's still some enhancing magic left to help you rout those reprobate wraith bats...
    Let's get back to business before that brutish Pyracmon can ruin the rest of the Harvest Festival, kupo.${prompt}
  8326: |-
    I am literally spellbound, adventurer!
    Your contributions have surpassed our expectations. Take this as thanks from the bottom of our black hearts.${prompt}
  8327: It turns out the energy contained in these so-called “Middle Lands” isn't so middling after all. At least it'll be of use once our preparations are underway.${prompt}
  8328: |-
    Indubitably.
    While we must bid farewell to this continent, you can always use that headgear to fly over for a reunion.${prompt}
  8329: |-
    Hyah, hyah, hyah! How gullible you are!
    You may be well versed in the arts of magic, but your sense of humor still leaves much to be desired.${prompt}
  8330: '...Until next time.${prompt}'
  8331: What in the wide world was with those bizarre bats, kupo? I assumed they were allies of that apocalyptic abomination Pyracmon, but it seems my intuition was incorrect...${prompt}
  8332: |-
    But based on the variety of their vexing vocal vibrations, I'd say there were three theurgists controlling those preternatural parasites.
    All that's beside the point, I suppose. Now we've got to start over from scratch, kupo...${prompt}
  8333: This trace amount leaves our thirst for magic unquenched. The pact cannot be completed unless you return with the ordained measure.${prompt}
  8334: |-
    What do you expect us to do with these spectral dregs!?
    This is nothing! Nothing!
    Don't come back here again until you've obtained an amount decent enough to study!${prompt}
  8335: |-
    Your total...only equivalent to ${number: 0} mandragora-power...
    We require more...${prompt}
  8336: How...disappointing. Then I shall take your reply to mean you do not require a certain miraculous artifact we had been saving for you.${prompt}
  8337: |-
    ...Fine! See if I care!
    In fact, I care so little that I'm gonna put a curse on you for refusing to help us, so there!${prompt}
  8338: '...Of course you won''t now...but you will eventually.${prompt}'
  8339: |-
    Whew, for a moment I was positively petrified about your progression on this particular peregrination.
    Now that that's that, though, let's go pummel Pyracmon, puko! Er, kupo!${prompt}
  8340: Such arcane power could be put to much more productive uses than banishing that fairy tale of an exorcist...${prompt}
  8341: Should you take the time to charge that spell once more, we would certainly make it worth your while.${prompt}
  8342: Nothing seems out of the ordinary here, yet you cannot help but feel ill at ease...${prompt}
  8343: |-
    Kupopopo!?
    According to my observations, some occult object has emerged next to that eerie effulgence. Whatever could it be, kupo?${prompt}
  8344: A field manual has been placed here by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network (A.M.A.N.). Useful information pertaining to various topics on field operations fills its pages.${prompt}

  11456: |-
    What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo!
    Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!${prompt}
  11457: |-
    We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers.

    Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo.
    Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom.
    It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!${prompt}
  11460: The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!${prompt}
  11461: |-
    In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign.
    Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.${prompt}
  11462: Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...${prompt}
  11463: |-
    King Kupofried was greatly dismayed.
    How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?${prompt}
  11464: In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.${prompt}
  11465: “Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo,” he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.${prompt}
  11466: |-
    Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin.
    A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?${prompt}
  11467: |-
    We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition.
    We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!${prompt}

    I'm assuming you have experience with uragnites, those massive but gentle bivalves common-wommon to the warm waters of the south.
    Well, a specimen has somehow managed to scuttle its way over to Grauberg.${prompt}
  11573: Taken by curiosity, my companions and I approachy-woached it, thinking it harmless. But we were quickly made to learn the error of this assumption to our grievous sorrow-worrow.${prompt}

  11642: The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called “Voidwalkers.” Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt}
  11643: |-
    Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.
    This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt}
  11644: Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt}
  11645: A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt}
  11646: Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt}
  11647: |-
    Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.
    Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt}
  11648: Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt}
  11649: Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt}
  11650: However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt}
  11651: |-
    When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.
    These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt}
  11652: Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt}
  11653: The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt}
  11654: |-
    Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.
    Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt}
  11655: As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt}
  11656: Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt}
  11657: Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt}
  11658: After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt}
  11659: Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt}
  11660: Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  11661: While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  11662: Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt}
  11663: Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt}
  11664: Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt}
  11665: Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt}
  11666: Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt}
  11667: The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt}
  11668: The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt}
  11669: Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt}
  11670: 'Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt}'

  11672: Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}
  11673: Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.${prompt}
  11674: Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.${prompt}
  11675: As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.${prompt}
