  10830: |-
    What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo!
    Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!${prompt}
  10831: |-
    We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers.
    But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!${prompt}

    There! I've whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me.
    Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!${prompt}
  10833: |-
    Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo.
    Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom.
    It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!${prompt}
  10834: The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!${prompt}
  10835: |-
    In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign.
    Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.${prompt}
  10836: Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...${prompt}
  10837: |-
    King Kupofried was greatly dismayed.
    How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?${prompt}
  10838: In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.${prompt}
  10839: “Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo,” he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.${prompt}
  10840: |-
    Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin.
    A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?${prompt}
  10841: |-
    We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition.
    We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!${prompt}

    I'm in charge of running the ${choice: 0}[beginner/intermediate/advanced] level Smilebringer Boot Camp in this area.${prompt}
  10892: |-
    I'd be thrilled to answer any questions you might have...and of course, sign you up, too!
    You'd like that, wouldn't you? Hmmm?${prompt}
  10893: |-
    What will you do?
    ${selection-lines}
    Undertake training.
    Hear an explanation.
    What's the qualifying time?
    What's the fastest time?
    Nothing.${prompt}
  10894: 'Fantastic! But, oh...it seems you don''t have ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}. Well, that''s just too bad!'
  10895: |-
    It'd be my pleasure! Here goes nothing! Ahem!
    The Smilebringer Boot Camp was established for two purposes, the first being the ongoing training and conditioning of smilebringers. The second--and this is where you come in, yay!--is for us to scout hopefuls from the adventurer community to join our jovial ranks!${prompt}
  10896: The population of vicious monsters has grown in recent years, you see. And because of this, more smilebringers were being--<gasp!>--injured in the line of duty than ever before.${prompt}
  10897: |-
    But we weren't going to take that sitting down, no siree.
    The day we smilebringers stop doing our job--that is, bringing smiles--is the day the world ends!${prompt}
  10898: Whatever the predicament, and no matter the size of the ruszor-inflicted gash wound, we will--we must--pull through...for the sake of the children!${prompt}
  10899: |-
    With these heart-warming ideals in mind, the Smilebringer Boot Camp was established. Ta-da!
    Smilebringers graduating from this camp are better equipped to meet the ever-changing needs of these unstable times we live in.${prompt}
  10900: |-
    The rules are as simple as sunshine. Smilebringer's honor!
    When I give you the word, run to each of the checkpoints we've set up in the area. “Smile helpers” are posted at each, so you can't miss them!${prompt}
  10901: |-
    Talk to the smile helpers and they'll confirm your passage.
    The route you take is completely up to you--just be sure you don't miss any checkpoints. You got all that? Hmmm?${prompt}
  10902: I'll mark each smile helper's location on your map beforehand, so you don't need to worry about getting lost.${prompt}
  10903: Once you've finished visiting all the checkpoints, you have to--you guessed it!--come back and report to me. It's okay, I won't bite!${prompt}
  10904: What I will do, though, is tell you how quickly you completed the course. After all, to a smilebringer, speed is everything. Some folks run faster with a fell beast hot on their tail, but we smilebringers need no more than the thought of a child's laughter to spur us on! Zoom zoom!${prompt}
  10905: Oh, and I should mention that at this time of year, we're collecting donations in the form of a small fee to participate in the training. All proceeds go towards presents for the children during the Starlight Celebration. Thank you for your cooperation!${prompt}
  10906: |-
    One more thing you should know. If you venture out of the area, the training will automatically be canceled.
    But I can trust you not to walk out on your favorite smile sergeant, right? Hmmm?
  10907: |-
    So far, the fastest time in this area is ${number: 5} minute${choice-plurality: 5}[/s] ${number: 6} second${choice-plurality: 6}[/s]. Wow!
    And the name of the greased lightning who set this record is ${entity: 0}. Don't be forgetting that, you hear?${prompt}

    And if you manage a time quicker than ${number: 3} minute${choice-plurality: 3}[/s] ${number: 4} second${choice-plurality: 4}[/s]...then you and I had better trade places! Oh, that would be so much fun, wouldn't it?${prompt}
  10909: |-
    Awww... You've made this smile sergeant very sad...
    But I'll be glued to this spot, because I just know you'll be back to turn my frown upside down! Yes siree!
  10910: |-
    At this time of year, we're collecting a donation of ${number: 6} gil from each participant.

    Oh no! I'm afraid your time falls short of qualification!
    As much as I want to give you a passing grade, headquarters wouldn't let me hear the end of it.
  10929: |-
    Oh no! Please don't be mad, but...I forgot to record your time.
    I hope you'll find it in your heart to forgive this scatterbrain of a smile sergeant...
  10930: |-
    It might surprise you to learn this, but even the toughest--grrrrrr!--and roughest of us smilebringers need rest and relaxation.
    Oh, wipe that grin off your face! I knew you wouldn't believe me!${prompt}

    Aaanyway! What I meant to say is, “work hard, play hard” is our motto, and it applies to boot camp participants, too.

  11066: The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called “Voidwalkers.” Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt}
  11067: |-
    Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.
    This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt}
  11068: Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt}
  11069: A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt}
  11070: Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt}
  11071: |-
    Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.
    Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt}
  11072: Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt}
  11073: Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt}
  11074: However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt}
  11075: |-
    When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.
    These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt}
  11076: Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt}
  11077: The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt}
  11078: |-
    Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.
    Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt}
  11079: As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt}
  11080: Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt}
  11081: Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt}
  11082: After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt}
  11083: Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt}
  11084: Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  11085: While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  11086: Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt}
  11087: Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt}
  11088: Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt}
  11089: Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt}
  11090: Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt}
  11091: The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt}
  11092: The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt}
  11093: Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt}
  11094: 'Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt}'

    Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul.
    Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.${prompt}

  11195: But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.${prompt}

    As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.${prompt}

    Absorbing this energy causes the abyssite to evolve, or more accurately, makes it attuned to other planar rifts.

  12004: “Voidwalker” is the name given to creatures that roam the realm between worlds.${prompt}
  12005: Little is known about them at this time, except that they're driven by an insatiable lust for destruction.${prompt}
  12006: 'While reports of Voidwalker encounters vary greatly in content, one thing is certain: the creatures are gaining in strength, a mounting threat that cannot be left unchecked.${prompt}'
  12007: In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning adventurers to lend their aid.${prompt}
  12008: As the nature of Voidwalker battles renders full-scale military operations unfeasible, we have chosen to stake our success on the mobility and versatility of adventurers.${prompt}
  12009: In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning soldiers of the Allied Forces to lend their aid.${prompt}
  12010: To be sure, there're those who question the wisdom of thinning our ranks in the face of the Shadow Lord's armies. But I assure you, friend, the Voidwalker threat is no less real.${prompt}
  12011: Our scouts regularly bring back intel on locations of suspected Voidwalker presence.${prompt}
  12012: Armed with this information, we dispatch strike teams to preemptively neutralize the threat.${prompt}
  12013: |-
    Ordinarily, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.
    Only by using the voidstone's power can we force them to feel the sting of our steel.${prompt}
  12014: |-
    These magicked stones are distributed in regular shipments from our Jeuno-based research team.
    They're the bare minimum we need to have a fighting chance against the enemy.${prompt}
  12015: Voidstones work by realigning your existential spectrum to match that of Voidwalkers, thus rendering the creatures visible to you.${prompt}
  12016: 'The stones are highly prized, such is the difficulty of their creation. As such, supplies are limited to ${number: 0} stones per person at any given time.${prompt}'
  12017: That's provided we have any in stock at all. Much time is required in imbuing them with requisite powers.${prompt}
  12018: The Voidwatch is an organization that exists for the sole purpose of protecting the world from extradimensional invaders we call “Voidwalkers.”${prompt}
  12019: Recognizing the graveness of this threat, the nations of the Middle Lands joined together in common cause and formed the Voidwatch.${prompt}
  12020: Helming the organization is the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, with the remaining three nations contributing resources for its operation.${prompt}
  12021: 'Possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt}'
  12022: It can be earned only through loyal service to your nation, and thus serves as a testimonial for your prowess.${prompt}
  12023: You would do well to obtain one if you haven't already done so.${prompt}
  12024: Affiliation with the Allied Forces of Altana is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt}
  12025: In other words, you must belong to the armed forces of one of the three nations.${prompt}
  12026: The enlistment procedure varies depending on nation. Those wishing to obtain a recommendation letter should pay visit to one of the military encampments surrounding Jeuno.${prompt}
  12027: When you battle a Voidwalker, you must do so as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of the dimension who has harnessed the powers of the voidstone and stratum abyssite.${prompt}
  12028: Bereft of these two objects, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.${prompt}
  12029: However, there are a few points all budding Voidwatchers should bear in mind.${prompt}
  12030: Most crucial of all, the extradimensional nature of being a Voidwatcher renders you isolated and unable to receive help from the outside world.${prompt}
  12031: Scientists attribute this to the dimensional misalignment that occurs. As people are ordinarily unable to see Voidwalkers, so too are they unable to see you.${prompt}
  12032: But you needn't concern yourself with the hows and whys of such matters. It would behoove you far more to become familiar with the workings of the “existential spectrum.”${prompt}
  12033: |-
    You see, each dimension is composed of an existential spectrum to which all things within are aligned.
    In turn, the spectrum is formed of five lights: blue, red, yellow, green, and white.${prompt}
  12034: The alignment of these lights between Voidwalker and Voidwatcher plays an important role in our efforts.${prompt}
  12035: To elaborate, the act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning ourselves to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  12036: Now, while Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with these creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  12037: Compensating measures, however, have been developed to allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe.${prompt}
  12038: One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items,” while another entails performing certain actions against the enemy.${prompt}
  12039: Both methods aim to manipulate the alignment value of individual lights to various ends.${prompt}
  12040: All five lights influence the contents of the treasure chest which appears at the successful end of battle.${prompt}
  12041: Our researchers have succeeded in determining what manner of benefits are associated with each light.${prompt}
  12042: For instance, improving blue spectral alignment is known to produce greater quantities of spoils.${prompt}
  12043: In contrast, manipulating red spectral alignment reportedly enhances the quality of individual items--potions becoming hi-potions, and so forth.${prompt}
  12044: Yellow and green, on the other hand, influence experience gain and cruor yield respectively.${prompt}
  12045: If you wish to know more about the curious red substance we call cruor, you need but ask.${prompt}
  12046: |-
    Lastly, we have white spectral alignment, which is unique even in this company.
    It has been determined to affect the appearance of transdimensional objects such as atmacite and periapt.${prompt}
  12047: Research regarding these artifacts is still ongoing.${prompt}
  12048: Lastly, be reassured that there're no known negative effects of manipulating spectral alignment. We unreservedly encourage all Voidwatch operatives to endeavor towards maximum alignment.${prompt}
  12049: Ascent items are unique objects that can be used to manipulate the spectral alignment of corresponding lights in the existential spectrum.${prompt}
  12050: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are representative of such items.
    They're the pride and joy of our Jeuno-based research team, who'd have folk believe they're the greatest inventions since airships.${prompt}
  12051: (Just between you and me, though, it is Far Eastern scientists that pioneered the technology they're based upon.)${prompt}
  12052: They're not the only means by which we manipulate spectral alignment, mind you. Similar results can be achieved by performing specific actions against the enemy.${prompt}
  12053: Truth be told, much is still shrouded in mystery. What actions will produce the desired effect is something you will have to discover for yourself through trial and error.${prompt}
  12054: Defeating a Voidwalker will cause a mysterious pyxis to emerge at the selfsame planar rift whence the creature was felled.${prompt}
  12055: 'Such riftworn pyxides exhibit a most peculiar characteristic: the content they bear reportedly changes depending on who glimpses within.${prompt}'
  12056: |-
    Our scientists conjecture that this is due to some trick of spectral alignment. As with numerous other mysteries surrounding Voidwalkers, however, I highly doubt they have even an inkling of understanding.
    But I digress...${prompt}
  12057: Only one combatant need possess a voidstone for all party or alliance members to do battle with a Voidwalker. Of the other squad members only stratum abyssite is required.${prompt}
  12058: |-
    As always seems to be the case, however, there is a catch.
    Pyxides have been observed to yield less spoils for combatants without a voidstone of their own.${prompt}
  12059: It scarce needs be said, but it would be to your benefit to have both the aforementioned items readied before taking on a Voidwalker.${prompt}
  12060: |-
    Lastly, a warning: pyxides will eventually vanish if left untouched overlong.
    Our scientists have put forth the theory of normalizing spatial dissonance, but you needn't concern yourself with their mumbo-jumbo.${prompt}
  12061: Just see to it that your hard-earned spoils are claimed in good time, and things will be rosy for all involved.${prompt}
  12062: 'The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is a magicked object produced by the Voidwatch''s Jeuno-based research wing.${prompt}'
  12063: Its innocuous appearance belies the immense power it holds...the power to render Voidwalkers visible to its bearer.${prompt}
  12064: The stone achieves this feat by realigning our existential spectrum to that of the creature.${prompt}
  12065: I shall explain the process in layman's terms for your benefit. No need to thank me--I merely perform my duty.${prompt}
  12066: I want you to visualize two canvases, each the same distance from the other. Yes, as two separate objects are normally wont to be.${prompt}
  12067: Imagine you and I standing on one of the canvases--what else does one do with a canvas but stand on it, yes?${prompt}
  12068: Now, imagine Voidwalkers standing on the other canvas, doing whatever it is Voidwalkers do. Destroying things and behaving with utter impropriety, no doubt.${prompt}
  12069: |-
    Being on two different canvases, it follows that we cannot touch the Voidwalkers, let alone see them.
    Actually, that doesn't explain why we can't see the Voidwalkers...unless it's a magical canvas they're on that makes all things upon it invisible! Yes, that'll serve!${prompt}
  12070: And this brings us full circle back to the voidstone. I want you to think of it as a magical paintbrush that we use to...grapple ourselves over to the Voidwalkers' canvas. Thence the fighting begins.${prompt}
  12071: |-
    I trust you now have a rudimentary understanding of the process. That's all you need, really.
    Leave the fractal geometry to the fractal geometrists, I always say.${prompt}
  12072: |-
    As long as you remember the canvas and the paintbrush--that's the voidstone--you cannot go astray.
    Now, to apprise you of more practical matters...${prompt}
  12073: Twenty hours (Earth time) is required to produce a stone and imbue it with the necessary magicks, although word is that this may be shortened as research progresses.${prompt}
  12074: |-
    Mind you, this isn't the only variety of stone you'll be needing.
    There exists another: stratum abyssite.${prompt}
  12075: |-
    Whereas the voidstone serves as a power source, acting as a compass for channeling that power is stratum abyssite.
    Only by using the two in conjunction can we achieve our objectives.${prompt}
  12076: |-
    Are you familiar with ${color: 5}voiddust${color: 1}?
    Put simply, it is a granular substance from which voidstones may be fabricated.${prompt}
  12077: |-
    As I explained, significant time is required to produce a voidstone from scratch.
    Provide me with voiddust, however, and I can fashion a stone for you in short order.${prompt}
  12078: |-
    The same comrades of ours who stock ascent items may also furnish you with voiddust.
    Why do they not fabricate the stones themselves, or deliver the dust directly to me?
    Shush! The Voidwatch works in mysterious ways, and it would behoove you to inquire no further.${prompt}
  12079: |-
    At any rate, should you manage to obtain any ${color: 5}voiddust${color: 1} in your travels, you need only return here and trade it to me.
    Simple enough, wouldn't you say?${prompt}
  12080: Furthermore, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.${prompt}
  12081: Based on the evolutionary state of your stratum abyssite, the Voidwatch will direct you to a suitable operation area.${prompt}
  12082: If you wish to have your stone analyzed, simply present it to an atma refiner.${prompt}
  12083: |-
    Planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space--have manifested across the land.
    The Voidwalker hordes roam beyond, unchecked and ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt}
  12084: By invoking the power of stratum abyssite, it is possible to battle the fell creatures as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of our dimension.${prompt}
  12085: Those also possessed of a voidstone will find their Voidwatcher experience greatly enhanced.${prompt}
  12086: Alone, however, stratum abyssite serves no purpose; only when used in conjunction with a voidstone can its powers be unleashed.${prompt}
  12087: Hence, at least one member of your squad--be it party or alliance--must possess a voidstone in order to arrange a confrontation with a Voidwalker.${prompt}
  12088: Keep this fact in mind at all times.${prompt}
  12089: It is not known when the planar rifts first manifested. Some say they've always been there, while others claim recent events have triggered their appearance.${prompt}
  12090: If only we could return to the past, perhaps we could shed some light upon this mystery...${prompt}
  12091: Obtainable by defeating Voidwalkers, cruor is an energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt}
  12092: While appearing to be some manner of mineral, detailed analysis has revealed that cruor is in fact organic.${prompt}
  12093: |-
    As far as our researchers can tell, however, it's inanimate like most well-behaved plants.
    There's no fear of cruor suddenly springing to life in your palms.${prompt}
  12094: Being supremely pleasing to the eyes, cruor might have adorned the display cases of many a jewelry shop during peacetime. Unfortunately, the age demands that its unique properties be put to more practical uses.${prompt}
  12095: |-
    Namely, the infusion and enrichment of atmacite.
    If you wish to learn about these two processes, you need but ask an atmacite refiner, our experts on such matters.${prompt}
  12096: As cruor is a vital aspect of our operations, the Voidwatch is always looking to procure more. Should you have any excess cruor, we would be glad to take it off your hands and offer you useful items in exchange.${prompt}
  12097: Abyssite is the name given to a mysterious stone that assumes various forms and colors, the roles they serve likewise manifold in nature.${prompt}
  12098: Of the copious varieties thus far discovered, there exist those called “periapt”--lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt}
  12099: Defeating a Voidwalker is known to yield periapt on very rare occasions. Serve the Voidwatch earnestly, however, and you will surely have one to call your own.${prompt}

  12155: '${color-alt: 123}You may also undertake this operation at Beaucedine Glacier.'
  12156: Greetings, traveler. I am Saarlan, student of the illustrious archmage Abdhaljs.${prompt}
  12157: |-
    My master has entrusted me with the care of his most prized creation: a miniature battlefield--or maquette--of peerless construction.
    Behold the “Legion”!${prompt}
  12158: |-
    Needless to say, the maquette is no mere ornament.
    It has been imbued with powerful magicks that allow one to shrink to minuscule sizes and live out epic battles within its walls--battles the likes of which could scarce be imagined in our reality!${prompt}
  12159: |-
    How does it work? The Far Eastern invocations imbued in the maquette are known to my master, and my master alone.
    The inner workings of these spells would be far beyond the grasp of ordinary mortals such as you or me.${prompt}
  12160: |-
    Those who venture into the maquette will face legions of foes possessing nigh-inconceivable power, painstakingly recreated from records contained in bestiaries of yore.
    Needless to say, the challenge will be unlike anything you have faced thus far.${prompt}
  12161: While there is no danger of actually losing your life in the maquette, know that the physical efforts you expend--and pain you endure--within its walls will be all too real.${prompt}
  12162: The potential rewards to be gained from battling the legions are tremendous, but only for those who are up to the task.${prompt}
  12163: Should you have any doubt in your abilities, I suggest you walk away...and quickly.${prompt}
  12164: If, however, you are a true champion seeking the ideal venue to test your abilities to the utmost, then you have found it here.${prompt}
  12165: Why did my master take such pains to create a simulated battlefield of such daunting challenge?${prompt}
  12166: |-
    Perhaps it was merely a flight of fancy.
    Perhaps he wished to test the limits of his own strength, and found the challenges of our real world wanting...?${prompt}
  12167: |-
    Let it suffice to say that genius works in mysterious ways.
    We must consider ourselves fortunate to be able to enjoy the fruits of my master's labor.${prompt}
  12168: |-
    ...But I digress. Should you wish to proceed, I shall require from you a nominal fee in gil.
    It is a costly task to keep the maquette in prime working condition, I fear.${prompt}
  12169: |-
    Have you the strength and resolve to face the legions and emerge victorious?
    Look deep within yourself, and return to me when you have found the answer.${prompt}
  12170: We await your challenge, traveler.${prompt}
  12171: |-
    Welcome, traveler.
    Are you prepared to face the legions?${prompt}
  12172: |-
    Ask about something?
    ${selection-lines}
    Obtain ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.
    Obtain ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}.
    Exchange Legion points.
    About Legion.
    About the rules.
    About fees.
    Entering the maquette.
    Battling the legions.
    The ultimate challenge?
    Nothing for now.${prompt}
  12173: “Legion” is the name bestowed upon the most formidable of the simulated battlefields wrought by my master, the renowned archmage Abdhaljs.${prompt}
  12174: |-
    You may be familiar with the dioramas employed in Conflict.
    The concept behind Legion is quite similar.${prompt}
  12175: One notable difference is that you need not place a reservation to participate in Legion.${prompt}
  12176: On the fields of battle, you will square off against veritable hordes of fearsome beasts, painstakingly recreated from historical and mythical bestiaries using arcane Far Eastern magicks known only to my master.${prompt}
  12177: |-
    It is a simulation, mind you, so you need not fear repercussions on our external reality.
    There was one...incident...when a behemoth escaped from a prototype of the maquette, but my master assures me that such imperfections have long since been addressed.${prompt}
  12178: For your initial challenge, you may choose from four battlefields.${prompt}
  12179: After being transported inside the maquette, you will be pitted against a legion of fearsome foes.${prompt}
  12180: |-
    You will be allotted ${number: 0} minutes to dispatch the enemy.
    Furthermore, the maquette has a maximum capacity of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[combatant/combatants].${prompt}
  12181: 'That said, you are free to take on the legions with as few as ${number: 0} in your band...if you are confident in your abilities.${prompt}'
  12182: For the safety of all involved, only adventurers who are judged worthy of the challenge will be authorized to enter the maquette.${prompt}
  12183: '${color-alt: 121}You must be level ${number: 0} or higher to participate in Legion.'
  12184: |-
    The battle will begin when the hour inscribed upon your ${item-singular: 0[2]} reaches zero.
    Prepare as necessary and make your way to the battlefield antechamber in a timely fashion.${prompt}
  12185: |-
    Participants will be automatically transported inside the maquette when the battle begins.
    Should you wish to take to the battlefield sooner, you may enter the portal at any time.${prompt}
  12186: |-
    When time expires, you will be transported out of the maquette, whether or not the battle still rages on.
    Let not overmuch caution be your downfall.${prompt}
  12187: |-
    You may remain in the antechamber for ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[minute/minutes] after the battle has concluded.
    Of course, you may also depart at will by examining the Legion Tome.${prompt}
  12188: |-
    Should you find yourself overwhelmed, you are free to withdraw from the battlefield at any time via the Legion portals.
    You shall not be permitted reentry, so be sure to divvy up any spoils you have earned before taking your leave.${prompt}
  12189: |-
    ...And that is the essence of Legion.
    Are there any other topics on which I may enlighten you?${prompt}
  12190: |-
    To participate in Legion, you will first need ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} or ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}.
    You may purchase them for ${number: 2} or ${number: 3} gil, respectively.${prompt}
  12191: |-
    That is to say, the fee to do battle will vary depending on the number of combatants in your band.
    While nothing would please us more than to render this service for free, I fear that maintaining the maquette is a costly endeavor indeed.${prompt}
  12192: |-
    You wish to know more about battling the legions?
    Very well. Allow me to explain.${prompt}
  12193: |-
    Foes you dispatch may leave behind items on occasion.
    You are strongly encouraged to discuss the distribution of spoils with your companions beforehand.${prompt}
  12194: |-
    Hack and slash haphazardly and you will find yourself with no time to properly divvy up the loot you have earned.
    A wasted opportunity, to say the least.${prompt}
  12195: You will also be rewarded with Legion Points for each enemy you fell.${prompt}
  12196: |-
    Legion Points may be exchanged for an impressive selection of rare rewards.
    It would behoove you to amass as many as is within your power.${prompt}
  12197: |-
    The greatest rewards, however, will be reserved for those who triumph over the overlords of each legion.
    Mind you, this is no meager task.${prompt}
  12198: |-
    Even should you meet your unfortunate demise, take heart. Your wounds will be healed upon leaving the maquette.
    Fear not, and assail the fiends with all your strength!${prompt}
  12199: |-
    Ho ho... Aren't you the curious one?
    I say only this: Master Abdhaljs has prepared a challenge that promises to strike fear in the hearts of even champions of legend.${prompt}
  12200: |-
    Only those who have proved their mettle against all four legions will be granted entry to the final domain.
    The trophies you acquire will serve as evidence of your valor.${prompt}
  12201: |-
    Have the leader of your band trade any trophies you acquire to my associate Mayuyu.
    In return, she shall furnish you with the corresponding victory medal.${prompt}
  12202: |-
    Only a champion bearing all four medals may lead a band to the ultimate test of courage.
    This is a precautionary measure that I assure you is for the good of all.${prompt}

  12287: Well, if this isn't the cat's meow. There is something you wish to ask of me? Hoping to have me shed some light on a particular matter?${prompt}
  12288: '...This is wholly unexpected.${prompt}'
  12289: I've seen futures both brighter and darker, but in each at least there was a future.${prompt}
  12290: Ah, but those feathered wings represent a new hope. A possibility to ensure that what should come to be...does come to be.${prompt}
  12291: Perhaps it's best if we not paw around here, and consult Atomos instead. Ask his opinion.${prompt}
  12292: Which means that you'll have need of this.${prompt}
  12293: This should provide entry into what we call the “Walk of Echoes.”${prompt}
  12294: The entrance there is the same as the entrance here--a cavernous maw. Gaping expanse of space.${prompt}
  12295: ${name-player}, you have come. Shown your face before me.${prompt}
  12296: Alexander's cry has reached my ears.${prompt}
  12297: Ah, I have awaited you. Hoped for this chance.${prompt}
  12298: Unfurling here before you is the Walk of Echoes.${prompt}
  12299: If you look above, you will see the prime avatar Atomos given physical form...${prompt}
  12300: Or so you would think. No, the entire Walk of Echoes itself is Atomos. Its body and soul.${prompt}
  12301: Some refer to him as the destroyer of worlds, for he feeds on futures that shall not come to pass. Whose existence is forbidden.${prompt}
  12302: I trust you remember that Atomos consumes all futures that are forbidden.${prompt}
  12303: And I'm sure the one question that must be pulling at your mind--bothering you to no end--is why Atomos is not feasting on your “dark future” as we speak.${prompt}
  12304: I, too, have pondered that very question, and I will not play cat and mouse with you--that future is not a forbidden one.${prompt}
  12305: There is nothing that I can do, what with Atomos so intricately connected to the laws of this world. So important to the way Vana'diel plays out.${prompt}
  12306: Oh? That's not why you're here?${prompt}
  12307: |-
    Why are you here?
    ${selection-lines}
    I need Iroha to be accepted.
    No real reason.${prompt}
  12308: Come, come. We all know that's a bald-faced lie. Nothing could be further from the truth.${prompt}
  12309: Out with it. You'll never get what you wish for unless you ask.${prompt}
  12310: What a perplexing conundrum.${prompt}
  12311: I am quite lucky to have been protected by the Goddess, but you...a great pair of white wings has wrapped you in its embrace, although I'm hard-pressed to say why. I haven't got a whit of an idea.${prompt}
  12312: But those without such a boon cannot traverse the boundaries of time.${prompt}
  12313: Why would you think there would be a means to save her?${prompt}
  12314: You should count your blessings that Phoenix felt the need to save her at all. Most would have been left by the wayside.${prompt}
  12315: Why that dour look? Don't tell me you're going to come mewling some trite complaint.${prompt}
  12316: |-
    Well?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course I'm upset!
    Isn't there anything we can do?
    I...suppose not.${prompt}
  12317: An unsurprising response, to be sure.${prompt}
  12318: Of course you're upset. It's understandable.${prompt}
  12319: Forgive my starkness. A thousand apologies.${prompt}
  12320: But don't mistake my honesty for callousness. Your story has shook me to the bones. Sent a chill up my spine.${prompt}
  12321: I'm still letting it sink in--a force so mighty it can charm even Siren, the very mistress of seduction.${prompt}
  12322: I'm positively at the end of my rope. My wits' end.${prompt}
  12323: |-
    ...But there's still another option.
    Surely I don't need to tell you who Altana is.${prompt}
  12324: Never once have I been able to set eyes on her.${prompt}
  12325: But you...${prompt}
  12326: A day may yet come when you will be able to see her in person. Become the most intimate of acquaintances.${prompt}
  12327: Because you and yours are children of the Goddess.${prompt}
  12328: And you bear a brighter future on your wings.${prompt}
  12329: Wait! I have an idea. A flash of inspiration.${prompt}
  12330: Altana may be able to provide Iroha the succor she seeks.${prompt}
  12331: And if she can set everything right...it makes my whiskers twitch!${prompt}
  12332: Her love is eternal, and surpasses the very laws of our world.${prompt}
  12333: Of course, this leaves us the one small problem of how exactly you go about communing with her...${prompt}
  12334: |-
    However, I know of a “fabulous” person who might have an answer...${wait-36: 2}
    Lilisette.${prompt}
  12335: I'll see if I can bring her to you. But it'll take some time.${prompt}
  12336: Your first order of business should be to set things right in this world. Help subjugate the forces that threaten it.${prompt}
  12337: I'll claw at the problem from a couple different angles in the meantime.${prompt}
  12338: But never give up--spread your wings and soar to the heavens!${prompt}
  12339: Aha!
  12340: '${name-player}, it''s you! Did you happen upon ${choice: 2}[that regal cat/Cait Sith] again?${prompt}'
  12341: |-
    Hmmm...
    Then I have a stranger question: have you been having any odd dreams lately?${prompt}
  12342: ${name-player}...
  12343: A first reunion was surprising enough, but a second!${prompt}
  12344: This isn't going to be a happy one either, is it? What happened?${prompt}
  12345: Cait Sith was running around like a chicken with its head cut off, and I couldn't pluck the answers off her.${prompt}
  12346: All I know is that it's got to be related to those dreams I've been having. You've seen them too, haven't you?${prompt}
  12347: Is this another one of my dreams?${prompt}
  12348: I've seen all manner of disturbing dreams lately. Perhaps because of Lilith's dark future...${prompt}
  12349: You've seen similar ones too, haven't you?${prompt}
  12350: |-
    Have you had odd dreams?
    ${selection-lines}
    Not dreams, but visions...
    Not really.${prompt}
  12351: I knew I couldn't have been the only one!${prompt}
  12352: They shook me to the core. A blackness deeper than a starless night enveloped the world, and the screams of a thousand souls pierced the air.${prompt}
  12353: Are you quite sure?${prompt}
  12354: They shook me to the core. A blackness deeper than a starless night enveloped the world, and the screams of a thousand souls pierced the air.${prompt}
  12355: I wanted to reach out to them, but instead of grasping their hands I began to float upward, my form bound by light.${prompt}
  12356: I became one with that selfsame light...and the last thing I saw was your face.${prompt}
  12357: Your visage was even more noble than usual, and you had become...a god.${prompt}
  12358: Huh? You had a different dream?${prompt}
  12359: Wh-what!? That's an ill omen if I ever heard one!${prompt}
  12360: Could such terror truly be what the world has in store for us?${prompt}
  12361: |-
    Then in my dreams...all that light...
    Was it just a fraud, and I'm totally powerless!?${prompt}
  12362: What kind of trickery is this!?${prompt}
  12363: |-
    How do you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'll think of something.
    I need your help.
    ...${prompt}
  12364: Oh, I see how it is. You're going to run off and save the world!${prompt}
  12365: Hehe! I knew I should have had more confidence in you!${prompt}
  12366: And so...do you have a plan to meet with Altana?${prompt}
  12367: You say Cait Sith was on about meeting Altana being our only chance. But I wonder...${prompt}
  12368: Maybe we'll be able to think of something if we put our heads together.${prompt}
  12369: ${name-player}, you're really something else.${prompt}
  12370: You're right. Maybe we can come up with something if we put our heads together.${prompt}
  12371: I'm not sure exactly how to go about it, though.${prompt}
  12372: Cait Sith said that our best bet may lie in meeting with Altana?${prompt}
  12373: Even if we are the wings of the Goddess, that doesn't mean we have all the answers.${prompt}
  12374: We might have to rack our brains for this one...${prompt}
  12375: S-sorry for stepping out of line.${prompt}
  12376: I might not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but that doesn't mean I can't try my best to come up with something.${prompt}
  12377: After all, it's up to us to protect both the future and the past--and I hope you'd expect nothing less of me!${prompt}
  12378: So...Cait Sith said that meeting Altana might be our only shot?${prompt}
  12379: We might be the Goddess's wings, but...well, nothing pops right to mind.${prompt}
  12380: Maybe we'll find a solution if we put our heads together.${prompt}
  12381: Oh? What is...
  12382: Goodness! By the stars, what just happened!?${prompt}
  12383: That was no dream, right? Or was it? I...I saw the future!${prompt}
  12384: Nothing super far away, mind you, but something close that the two of us can bring about together!${prompt}
  12385: ${name-player}, not only did I see the future, but also the past. Memories of the times we spent together, both warm and cold. A phantasmagoric kaleidoscope of images.${prompt}
  12386: You're...absolutely sure I'm not dead? Hehehe!${prompt}
  12387: Something awful's happened! Not good at all!
  12388: If it isn't that odd kitty cat!
  12389: "Cait Sith...? What's wrong?\0 "
  12390: ${name-player}, it's about that ambassador “friend” of yours. The person you've been looking for.${prompt}
  12391: 'He found his way ${choice: 2}[here/to the Walk of Echoes]!${prompt}'
  12392: The Walk of Echoes?${prompt}
  12393: Oh dear. Here. I'll let ${name-player} explain the rest. Fill you in on the particulars.${prompt}
  12394: I need you to make haste! Move like the wind!${prompt}
  12395: 'How terrible must this foe be if he''s managed to make his way ${choice: 1}[to this world/to the Walk of Echoes]?${prompt}'
  12396: ${name-player}, I need you to make haste! Move like the wind!${prompt}
  12397: Quick! I'll open up a passage for you!${prompt}
  12398: Quick! I'll open up a passage for you!${prompt}
  12399: That orb you carry...the light erased all my doubts and fears. I'm ready for whatever may come to pass.${prompt}
  12400: Together we have the strength to conquer the darkness!${prompt}
  12401: I'll be waiting for you in the Walk of Echoes.${prompt}
  12402: And this Walk of Echoes...we can get there from a cavernous maw?${prompt}
  12403: Got it! I'll meet you there!${prompt}
