  6948: Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the “Layout” command, kupo!${prompt}

    Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!${prompt}
  6950: You can invite party and alliance members into your Mog House, kupo!${prompt}
  6951: You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!${prompt}

  7525: Ladies and gentlepeople, horrible and honorable! The Troupe Valeriano is proud to perform in a place as powerful and pleasantly peopled as this!${prompt}
  7526: Welcome to the Troupe Valeriano. Valeriano, at your service! Have a laugh, then spend some cash! Treats and sweets from exotic lands!${prompt}
  7527: '......${prompt}'
  7528: Surprising that an advanced country like Bastok could fall behind in conquests... That Hume technology can't do everything, I guess.${prompt}
  7529: I'm not too fond of the folksy-wolksy in these parts. All important with their noses in the air and their tails a-waving, but cheap as can be. You folk from other countries need to get cracking!${prompt}
  7530: Them Elvaan sure are strong with their pointy ears and pointy swords! San d'Oria's sure to be in the lead for a long while yet!${prompt}
  7531: The food around here's purrretty good, especially with all the exotic ingrrredients available these days.  My fellow Windurstians, you had better go on morrre conquests or you'll be left behind!${prompt}

    Interrrested in a knife trick?
    It's a special routine I worrrked out. But keep your distance, if you value your ears and moustaches as they are!${prompt}

  7537: Bastok is a much nicer place now than when I left it. You guys must've worked real hard! If only I could go back to bashing monster heads again with you guys.${prompt}
  7538: Isn't this place great? Bastok's my hometown, you know! Well, there might be a few problems, but it's still the best city in the world!${prompt}
  7539: There's a store that sells really good instruments here! I'm gonna-wanna sneak off there later. Ah! Shh, don't tell my boss...${prompt}
  7540: There's plenty of bards around, but I'm the best flute player in Vana'diel. You don't believe me? Stay awhile and listen.${prompt}
  7541: The food here's terrrible! C'mon, Windurstians, worrrk harder! I miss Windurstian cuisine.${prompt}

    Heh-heh-heh...

  7557: Haven't you ever heard the name of “Nanaa Mihgo”? Well, this is herrr house!${prompt}
  7558: We only take orders from the top cat. When she says, “Jump!”, we say, “How high?”...and we always land on our feet, of course.${prompt}

    Grrr...
    You don't seem to understand how harrrd being a member of her gang is, do you?${prompt}
  7560: |-
    Humph...
    Looks like that Nanaa Mihgo, better known as the Cat Burglar, is at her home forrr once.${prompt}
  7561: An adventurer such as yourself ought to be careful, lest you get burrrned.${prompt}
  7562: So, who do you think you arrre? You want to crrrawl up to me, do you?${prompt}
  7563: Well, if you bring me a little something as a sign of your desire to be my frrriend, I might just considerrr the possibility...${prompt}
  7564: Haven't I seen you somewhere beforrre? Weren't you the one running with those pack of brrrats from the port area?${prompt}
  7565: So you've come to apologize, have you? Well, you had better bring me a little something to show your desire to be my frrriend! Then I'll consider whether to forrrgive you or not...${prompt}
  7566: Well, if you want to be all chummy with me, you had better bring me a token offerrring firrrst. I'll be waiting... Hah!${prompt}
  7567: What's that? You're contemplating taking something to Nanaa Mihgo?${prompt}
  7568: I recommend you forrrget that! She'll take you in, all right, but not the way you expect! Haven't you heard that she's involved with some nasty foreign mob? Be carrreful!${prompt}
  7569: What? You want to make frrriends with Nanaa Mihgo? Well, you've got no chance of that right now, have you?${prompt}
  7570: If you want to run with the top cat, you'll have to be the right kind of rogue firrrst!${prompt}
  7571: 'We crrrawled up to the top cat by taking her four ${item-plural: 1[2]} each. That''s how she accepted us! You think you can match that?${prompt}'
  7572: 'You can get your paws on ${item-plural: 1[2]} by defeating those Yagudo beastmen. But you won''t please the Tarutaru very much if you go arrround fighting Yagudo!${prompt}'
  7573: Windurst is currently trying to maintain amicable relations with the Yagudo. It's a very different worrrld from what it was twenty years ago...${prompt}
  7574: Trying to win Nanaa Mihgo over is a waste of time! The most she will do is rrreturn your kindness with hostility.${prompt}
  7575: Looking at her, I rrrealize it's not a person's birth, but their upbringing, that determines who they become.${prompt}
  7576: Purrr... For you to bring me these implies my two followers out in front let the cat out of the bag.${prompt}
  7577: |-
    Well, anyway, I'll accept these as a token of your esteem. And if you happen by any more of these, then give them to me, and I'll make it worrrth your while.

    Humph!
    You just did as I said and gave the top cat some ${item-plural: 1[2]}, didn't you?${prompt}

    Well, anyway, apology accepted. Just be more careful next time! And if you happen by any more of these, then hand them to me, and I'll make it worrrth your while.

    Grrr...
    Who do you think you are? You shouldn't go sneaking around people's homes...you might be mistaken as a burglar!${prompt}

  7589: As farrr as I can tell, it looks just like a plain rock, but it may be some kind of ore or something. I wonderrr...${prompt}
  7590: Hey, that's it...! I have a little job for you! Carrre to go to the Goldsmiths' Guild in Bastok and ask them what in Vana'diel this is?${prompt}

    Neverrr mind.

  7593: If it isn't worth much, then go ahead and sell it to the Goldsmiths' Guild. Just make sure you bring the prrroceeds back to me, okay?${prompt}
  7594: Head over to the Goldsmiths' Guild in Bastok and ask them what that stone is.${prompt}
  7595: If it isn't worrrth much, then sell it to the Goldsmiths' Guild. Just be sure you bring the proceeds from the sale back to me, okay?${prompt}
  7596: So, did you make it to the Goldsmiths' Guild in Bastok? Good for you! And how much did you get for that lump of rrrock?${prompt}
  7597: |-
    Oh...You didn't sell it? Well, go back to Bastok and sell it, then.
    Now, get going!${prompt}
  7598: Well, if we've only learned one thing, it's this--it's farrr better to set our sights on the travelers in the port area.${prompt}
  7599: The travelers in Windurst Woods are all merchants who keep their guard up, or the occasional idiot who carries around a strange rock as if it's a precious jewel. Not worth the efforrrt, is it?${prompt}
  7600: |-
    Seems the top cat herrrself can make mistakes sometimes. Picking pebbles from the pockets of passers-by...
    My ass-onance! She's got me talking-walking like a Tarutaru now!${prompt}
  7601: |-
    Oops...!
    Keep what I said just now a secret, okay? Parrrticularly keep it from the top cat!${prompt}
  7602: |-
    Ah!
    Don't tell me you sold off my rock for that dismal sum!${prompt}
  7603: |-
    Grrr... If you hadn't sold it off, we could have received a bigger reward from that silly traveler for finding it...
    Oh well... It's no longer worth my bother.${prompt}
  7604: |-
    Ahhh...
    I traveled all the way here from Bastok, but I lost the stone that was the purpose of my journey.${prompt}
  7605: |-
    Hm?
    What kind of stone did I lose?${prompt}
  7606: It was a rock that we found in the Palborough Mines, north of Bastok. It had small traces of mythril in it.${prompt}
  7607: |-
    But that's not all...
    Besides the mythril, there's some unknown magic source in it.${prompt}
  7608: If you mention magic, then you think of Windurst, right? I was hoping to get the Rhinostery to check it out, so I came all the way here.${prompt}
  7609: But now that I've lost the rock in question, I'm stumped. After all the dangers I went through to get my hands on that rock, too... Boy, am I at my wits' end!${prompt}
  7610: 'I spread the word that I''d pay a reward to the one who finds my ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but didn''t get a single response.${prompt}'
  7611: Guess I'll have to go back to the depths of the Palborough Mines and dig up another one...but that place is so dangerous, and...how can I show my face in Bastok!?${prompt}
  7612: |-
    Oh...! Ooohhhww...!
    Just when I had given up hope, too! Thank you! Thank you ever so much!${prompt}
  7613: How can I ever repay you? Words cannot express my gratitude, so here, please accept this...${prompt}
  7614: |-
    Now I can show my face in Bastok again! Words will never express my gratitude...
    Just...thank you!${prompt}
  7615: Thanks for your help the other day! I took that stone and left it with the Rhinostery.${prompt}
  7616: Guess I'll just do some sightseeing until the results come back. Then again...I've already seen every nook and cranny of this place while I was searching frantically for the stone I lost!${prompt}
  7617: This is the eastern gatehouse--a gathering place for the guards who do the rrrounds of Windurst Woods.${prompt}
  7618: If you're after a map of Windurst, then head to the opening back up there. There's a Mithra merchant selling them there.${prompt}
  7619: |-
    How arrre you～?
    I'm fine, as always...I think.${prompt}
  7620: We've been having a spot of trouble because of those Yagudo beastmen, but Captain Rakoh Buuma's on hand, so things are underrr control...I think.${prompt}
  7621: Arrre you going to fight the good fight along with us? That'd be grrreat...I think. Speak to Captain Rakoh Buuma and she'll set you right!${prompt}

    To expel those who would subvert the law and order of Windurst Woods...
    To protect the Mithra populace from all manner of threats and dangers...
    That is the job of us guards.${prompt}
  7643: But lately, ferocious monsters are on the increase, and the beastmen are rrruining nature as they please, so our job is becoming all the more hectic.${prompt}
  7644: If you are a citizen of Windurst, then perhaps you may lend us a helping hand from time to time in order to protect the peace of our fair town.${prompt}

    Roger, Captain Buuma!
    It would indeed be an honorrr...${prompt}
  7650: Well, put simply, the gatehouses are where we guards worrrk and rest.${prompt}

    You see...well...erm...
    The Orastery in the port area is kinda looking for someone to help them with a magic experiment to be conducted at the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt}
  7665: I know it's a little sudden-wudden, but they said they were in a fix because they couldn't find anyone to help them. So, erm, how about it then...?${prompt}
  7666: |-
    Good. Carry out that mission!
    The Orastery is the ministry that rrruns a Mage Academy to improve the military's magic abilities.${prompt}
  7667: To get to the Orastery, you have to go to the port area by heading back west from this gate. Your country is counting on you!${prompt}
  7668: |-
    I, erm, I have a friend who serves at the Orastery. H-he's so cool!
    Gee... I wish I could be m-more like him!${prompt}
  7669: O-only the e-elite students from the School of Magic can go on to enter the Orastery. So, so the Tarutaru in the Orastery are the most brilliant magic users in the whole of Windurst!${prompt}
  7670: The Horutoto Ruins are a bunch of old towerrrs out in Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  7671: |-
    But they're all falling to pieces now...
    It was the Tarutaru who destrrroyed them. They insist it was all due to the Great Warrr, but that just sounds like halfling half-truths to me.${prompt}
  7672: You'rrre not s'posed to go straight to them magical towers, y'know? You'rrre s'posed to go to the O～rastery first...I think.${prompt}
  7673: The Orastery is in charge of the Mage Academy, y'know? That's where the Tarutaru practice their spells all day in order to perrrfect them. It's the big building in the port area...I think.${prompt}
  7674: The details of the mission will be explained when you meet with the Orastery's minister. I can't say he's the most pleasant of people, but at least he has guts.${prompt}
  7675: Do us proud!${prompt}
  7676: |-
    Good job!
    Glad to see you made it back alive! I trust the mission wasn't too dangerous.${prompt}
  7677: Allocating rrrank points according to your efforts...has enabled you to go up to rrrank two! Congratulations!${prompt}
  7678: Did you enjoy your little run-in with the ministerrr of the Orastery? Grrr... Oh, and were you able to meet his little sisterrr?${prompt}
  7679: The Minister of the Orastery's sisterrr is named Apururu. You'd know if you met herrr. She's also the ministerrr of the Manustery.${prompt}
  7680: Missions are all verrry well and good, but you should also try some quests too...I think!${prompt}
  7681: Speaking to the townsfolk and trrrying to help them with their problems... It can be very beneficial, y'know!${prompt}
  7682: You've come just at the rrright time. The Manustery just up the rrroad there is asking for help in making automaton guards at the Cardian workshop.${prompt}
  7683: Seeing as the Cardian workshop is rrright next door, you can hardly turn this mission down, can you?${prompt}
  7684: |-
    Accept this mission?
    ${selection-lines}
    Accept.
    Decline.${prompt}
  7685: Ask the staff at the Cardian workshop for the details.${prompt}

  7687: |-
    Rrreally?
    Too bad, then.${prompt}
  7688: C-Cardians were invented to fight as magical puppet-like s-soldiers in the Great War of twenty-wenty years ago.${prompt}
  7689: Th-thanks to the creation of the Cardians, Tarutaru and Mithra guards have come to suffer less injuries.${prompt}
  7690: Compared to us, Carrrdians are useless. They have no sense when it comes to fighting.${prompt}
  7691: However, I'll say this about them...they have no fearrr of death. Even we Mithra aren't as darrring as they are. That could be a powerrrful advantage...${prompt}
  7692: Go right down that road therrre, and when you come out into the round, you'll see a larrrge building up on your right...I think. Well, that's the Manustery's Cardian workshop, y'know?${prompt}
  7693: To find the entrances to the building, you may have to walk around the place a bit. But it's not enough to get you lost or anything...well, at least that's what I think.${prompt}
  7694: I'm sure the Minister of the Manustery will fill you in on the details of your mission.${prompt}
  7695: Cardians come in useful when you're after quantity over quality. Anyway, carry out your mission well--at least it'll help us keep the peace with our neighborhood ministry!${prompt}
  7696: |-
    Hello-ello! And you are...
    Oh, the volunteer to help us out with my Manustery's little mission, rightaru?${prompt}
  7697: |-
    Very nice of you to have come.
    My name is Apururu. I'm the Minister of the Manustery, and head of this Cardian workshop.${prompt}
  7698: But first, I should give you a rundown of what the Manustery is all about, I s'pose.${prompt}
  7699: The Manustery is the ministry in charge of the production of automaton guards, otherwise known as Cardians. As far as military might goes, our Cardians are second only to the Orastery's War Warlocks.${prompt}
  7700: Have you ever tried speaking to those doll-like beings that answer back in the words of the stars? Well, they are our Cardians!${prompt}
  7701: We cast a special kind of magic on a doll made of straw, cloth, and other stuff--that's what gives life to a Cardian.${prompt}
  7702: We ask traveling merchants or adventurers to provide us with most of the materials we need to make Cardians. But there is one essential material we can't just ask anyone to provide us with...${prompt}
  7703: That's the heart of the Cardian--a Mana Orb. Without a fully-charged Mana Orb, we cannot cast our special magic on the Cardian to keep them animated.${prompt}
  7704: That's why we leave the job of energizing Mana Orbs with magic to adventurers from Windurst only. These spheres are very important, so they cannot be entrusted to people-weople from other lands.${prompt}
  7705: Here...take these six dark Mana Orbs that have lost their glow.${prompt}
  7706: You are to go to the southeastern magic tower of the Horutoto Ruins in East Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  7707: That's the only magic tower that's still functioning well enough to energize Mana Orbs.${prompt}
  7708: Ask Pore-Ohre at the Horutoto Ruins to find out how to energize Mana Orbs properly-woperly.${prompt}
  7709: You could find it to be quite a troublesome task, so if you are not quite sure of yourself, ask some of your fellow adventurers for help. Well, good luck and ta-taru!${prompt}
  7710: Lately a lot of monsters have started to roam about under the southeastern magic tower, so make sure you're prepared for adventure.${prompt}
  7711: Once you have filled all of the Mana Orbs with magical energy, please bring them back here to me.${prompt}
  7712: Oh, and unless you have all six of the dark Mana Orbs placed in their respective receptacles, the magical energy of the tower won't flow through them at all. Make sure you have all six in position before you flick the switch on the big magical gizmo at the back of the tower's base.${prompt}
  7713: |-
    Well, take care, now.
    Try not to get into too much trouble.${prompt}
  7714: Ask Pore-Ohre in the southeastern magic tower of the Horutoto Ruins to find out how to energize Mana Orbs properly.${prompt}
  7715: Once you have filled all of the Mana Orbs with magical energy, please bring them back here to me. I'll be waiting for you.${prompt}
  7716: Almost all of the Horutoto Ruins were blown to pieces twenty years ago due to the enormous magic of the heroic “Mastermind of the Millennium.”${prompt}
  7717: The only magic tower left barely functioning, the southeastern one, is totally unstable-wable in the amount of energy it produces.${prompt}
  7718: So it's nigh on impossible to create quality Mana Orbs, which leaves us weakened dramatically.${prompt}
  7719: Mana Orbs are the hearts of Cardians, you know? If a Cardian were to lose its Mana Orb, it would return to being just an inanimate straw dolly-wolly.${prompt}
  7720: And, if the magical energy in the Mana Orb ever runs out, even if you were to re-energize it with the gizmos in the magic towers, they still forget everything that they remembered up to then.${prompt}
  7721: Either way, this is what's considered as “death” for Cardians.${prompt}
  7722: The reason that the life span of Cardians has become shortenedy is that the quality of the Mana Orbs has worsenedy.${prompt}
  7723: Just when the monsters are growing strongery and we need more Cardians than ever before, too... I'd hate to think what lies aheady if things go on like this...${prompt}
  7724: |-
    What?
    Some feral Cardians turned up againy-wainy?${prompt}
  7725: It's quite an embarrassing tale for us at the Manustery, but some of the old Cardians from the war years escaped and went wild...${prompt}
  7726: Those old Cardians carry out such wickedness as stealing Mana Orbs and attacking people.${prompt}
  7727: Mana Orbs are their hearts, remember? So the reason they steal the Mana Orbs is to revive their friends who have run out of magic in their Mana Orbs.${prompt}
  7728: But Mana Orbs are just spheres of magic. Unless there is a mage who can use the Mana Orb and breathe life into the Cardians, they are totally useless.${prompt}
  7729: So even if they are successful in stealing the Mana Orbs, it serves them no purpose...${prompt}
  7730: But I'm glad that you and poor Pore-Ohre are safe. That's the most important thing.${prompt}
  7731: Well, anyway, thank you for all your trouble and hard efforts. Until next time, then, ta-taru...!${prompt}
  7732: I hear that the Cardians who have escaped from our care have been gathering underground in the Horutoto Ruins and plotting bad deeds.${prompt}
  7733: If we leave them aloney-woney, the magic energy in their Mana Orb hearts will run out, and they will return to being nothing more than straw dolls.${prompt}
  7734: But someday I'll have to do something about the problem... Someday...${prompt}
  7735: |-
    Thank you very muchy-wuchy!♪
    Looks like you have re-energized all of our Mana Orbs. What a great help you were!♪${prompt}
  7736: But I'm glad nothing disastrously bad happened... Lately some of the people who have volunteered for this mission have been attacked by feral Cardians at the exit of the Horutoto Ruins!${prompt}
  7737: When you go about breathing life into the inanimate, who knows what will happen? We're just asking for trouble.${prompt}
  7738: But that's just a risk we Manustery employees have to take! It's just that...I wish they paid us a little more as hazard pay.${prompt}
  7739: The previous minister was a terrible man. When the war ended, he started throwing away our Cardians left, right and center.${prompt}
  7740: Of course the Cardians are going to run away. And of course they are going to come back and kidnap the previous minister. He should have seen it coming!${prompt}
  7741: It's said that underneath the southwesterny tower of the Horutoto Ruins is the graveyardy where the souls of the thrown away Cardians lingery.${prompt}
  7742: Minister Apururu once saidy that saving the souls of such automatonys is the responsibility of the Manustery.${prompt}
  7743: So, have these missions helped in making you stronger? Perhaps you're about rrready for a mission that involves the Yagudo beastmen.${prompt}
  7744: On the other side of West Sarutabaruta is a place called Giddeus--the home of the Yagudo.${prompt}
  7745: You know the Yagudo, don't you? They are the beastmen who for ever so long have rrravaged the grasslands of Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  7746: But the current Star Sibyl took it upon herself to try and make amicable rrrelations with the damned enemy...${prompt}
  7747: As a rrresult, we have to pay tribute to the Yagudo with food offerings as a sign of our friendship. That's the crux of this mission.${prompt}
  7748: First, you are to go to the Rrrhinostery's biological laboratory in Windurst Waters. The rrresearchers there will provide you with today's food offering for the Yagudo.${prompt}
  7749: The rrresearchers will tell you what you are to do next.${prompt}
  7750: This is an important mission issued by Heavens Tower, or more specifically, the Star Sibyl herself. Control your hatred of the beastmen and fulfill this mission as best as you can!${prompt}
  7751: |-
    Grrr... Dammit!
    How long do we have to go on paying tribute to scavengers who could double-cross us at any time?${prompt}
  7752: Anyway, you had better head on over to the Rrrhinostery in Windurst Waters, and pick up the food offering that the rrresearchers there have prepared for you to offer at Giddeus.${prompt}
  7753: I, I understand totally-wotally what the Star Sibyl is saying...${prompt}
  7754: The Star Sibyl is thinking first and foremost of the safety of us Windurstians.${prompt}
  7755: I just don't underrrstand why the Tarutaru fear those Yagudo.${prompt}
  7756: Like, wasn't it because of that old Shadow Lorrrd that they nearly lost the war twenty years ago?${prompt}
  7757: With him dead and burrried, even if we were to have an all-out war with the Yagudo, we'd still come out on top...I think.${prompt}
  7758: It's not like we're mindlessly opposed to a frrriendship pact with the Yagudo.${prompt}
  7759: Those Yagudo don't keep their side of the barrrgain. We have the old saying of “never share a meal with those who do not keep their prrromises.”${prompt}
  7760: |-
    So you completed the mission...?
    Then I shall be rrrecommending you for promotion to rrrank two.${prompt}
  7761: I suggest you try your hand at conquests now, as you'll need to gain more rrrank points before we can issue you further missions.${prompt}
  7762: You can gain the rrrank points you need from participating in the rrregional conquests. Ask the War Warlock guard in charge of conquests over there for further information...${prompt}
  7763: See you around.${prompt}
  7764: Grrr... You went ahead and fulfilled that mission, huh? That means we gave the lazy Yagudo nourrrishment to make them stronger...I think.${prompt}
  7765: Captain Rakoh Buuma also disagrrrees with the Star Sibyl on this, y'know? We should just rrrefuse to hand out this mission from now on...I think.${prompt}
  7766: |-
    W-well done!
    I knew you could do it. I, I hope you didn't get hurty-wurty.${prompt}
  7767: If only those Yagudo would let down their guardy-wuardy a bit, we wouldn't have to go through all that just to give them their offerings.${prompt}
  7768: Even though you got promoted to rank two, you're still an underrrling. But don't be disappointed...${prompt}
  7769: Underlings can get out of work without otherrr people complaining much. And you can also secretly eat some snacks too, if you're carrreful.${prompt}
  7770: Have you ever been to the Optistery's Library of Magic in Windurst Waters?${prompt}
  7771: Looks like they're in a spot of trouble there, as they are urgently asking for any able adventurer we have on hand to go help them out.${prompt}
  7772: |-
    How about it, then?
    If you feel you're up to it, why don't you volunteer to help the Optistery out?${prompt}
  7773: |-
    Accept Mission?
    ${selection-lines}
    Accept.
    Decline.${prompt}
  7774: Then proceed to the Optistery's Library of Magic immediately. It's on the north side of Windurst Waters--the building that the rrroad to the north gatehouse rrruns through.${prompt}
  7775: The Library of Magic is northwest of here in Windurst Waters--the area furthest away from Windurst Woods.${prompt}
  7776: The library lends out books if you're interested in them... Not that I've ever been there myself.${prompt}
  7777: I hear they have a problem with people taking out books and never rrreturning them. Grrr... Those Tarutaru are such easy game!${prompt}
  7778: Th-the Library of Magic isn't magic in name only. Almost all the books there have some sort of enchantment-bechantment cast upon them.${prompt}
  7779: W-when you check a book out, the librarians temporarily remove the magic for safety's sake. But, but, sometimes they've been known to forget, so be careful!${prompt}
  7780: I've borrowed books from the Librarrry of Magic too, you know.${prompt}
  7781: One time I took a book home to read, and as soon as I opened it a whole army of frrrogs came jumping out at me!${prompt}
  7782: I borrowed as many books as I could following that, but never had a single frog pop out at me. Too bad, as they were really tasty frrrogs, too!${prompt}
  7783: You'rrre going to the library, huh? That reminds me...I have a book overdue there...I think.${prompt}
  7784: What? You want to know what book I borrrrowed? Well, I'm not telling, so there!${prompt}
  7785: (Don't ask me what book I took out. It's not like I actually read them... They'rrre way over my reading age.)${prompt}
  7786: You want to know if I have a “restrrricted book” in my possession, do you?${prompt}
  7787: Where in Vana'diel did you hearrr that? You can never be too carrreful, you know.${prompt}
  7788: |-
    Okay, I'll let you in on it.
    You're a second rank adventurer, arrren't you? Then allow me to ask you this little favor I have firrrst...${prompt}
  7789: If you scratch my back, I'll scrrratch yours...so to speak. Do what I ask and I'll let you check the book I found. How about it, then?${prompt}
  7790: |-
    Hear her favor?
    ${selection-lines}
    Listen.
    Refuse.${prompt}
  7791: If that's how it is, then farrrewell, sucker.${prompt}
  7792: Did you know that up in the Tahrongi Canyon, there is a serrries of caves known as the Maze of Shakhrami?${prompt}
  7793: |-
    If you examine the rocks in those caves with this ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} harrrd enough, you should be able to find ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}. I want you to brrring me one.
    Happy hunting!${prompt}
  7794: In the Tahrongi Canyon, there is a serrries of caves called the Maze of Shakhrami.${prompt}
  7795: |-
    If you examine the rocks in those caves with that ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} you have therrre, you should be able to find ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}. I want you to brrring me one.
    No coral, no deal!${prompt}
  7796: You also want that book we found, don't you? Then you'll be needing something to trade the top cat with!${prompt}
  7797: |-
    Heh-heh-heh...
    We don't deal in cold, hard gil, you know? We much preferrr small and pretty valuables...${prompt}
  7798: Hah! If you want the book we found, then you'rrre in for some major wheeling and dealing with the top cat, arrren't you, now?${prompt}
  7799: |-
    Why's that, you say?
    Well, even that greedy, rich merrrchant from Windurst Waters is... Oops!${prompt}
  7800: |-
    Ignore what I just said.
    I'll make lute strings out of your guts if you tell anyone what I just let slip!${prompt}
  7801: |-
    So, you came thrrrough with it?
    Here, I'll give you this key. We'll make the trrransaction at my hideout, deep in the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt}
  7802: |-
    You go on ahead.
    I'll catch up with you therrre once I've finished up herrre!${prompt}
  7803: We'll carry out our little trrransaction at my hideout, deep in the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt}
  7804: |-
    You go ahead.
    I'll catch up with you therrre!${prompt}
  7805: I'm surprrrised you were able to find what we wanted. Now I can harrrdly wait to join the top cat in making the deal with you. Heh-heh-heh...${prompt}
  7806: You should alrrready know this, but don't you dare tell anyone about the little deal we'll be making. You'll have a cat in hell's chance of living if you spill the beans on us.${prompt}
  7807: I can't stand the sight of you. Get out of herrre, and don't show yourrr face to me any time soon.${prompt}
  7808: Some Carrrdians were carrying several larrrge boxes out of the Priming Gate in Windurst Walls.${prompt}
  7809: It was fun pulling a swift one on them, but it wasn't worrrth the trouble. Don't you darrre say crime doesn't pay!${prompt}
  7810: I meowed her once, I meowed her a thousand times. We should stop putting our paws on anything that smells of Carrrdians.${prompt}
  7811: I neverrr want to go through that sorrrt of thing again!${prompt}
  7812: |-
    You came at just the rrright time.
    We just rrreceived a rrrequest for help in a large-scale mission from Heavens Tower, but we're short of adventurers to dispatch just now.${prompt}
  7813: The secretary of Heavens Tower will explain what this mission entails. Proceed there immediately.${prompt}
  7814: Heavens Tower is north of here in Windurst Walls. You should have the details explained to you by the secretary there.${prompt}
  7815: Gee... I, I wish I could join in this mission-wission too!${prompt}
  7816: B-but I'm too scared to ask Sola Jaab, in, in case she literally b-bites my heady-weady off!${prompt}
  7817: |-
    Once you accept this mission, you won't be coming back here any time soon, y'know.
    And just when I was almost getting to like you...I think.${prompt}
  7818: Once you go to another countrrry, you'll realize just how good old Windurst is.${prompt}
  7819: The food is great, you can cat nap as much as you like, and turning up late is the norrrm. Everyone takes life easy herrre.${prompt}
  7820: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}!
    Heavens Tower is hailing you!${prompt}
  7821: Why, the head Sibyl Guard herself, Semih Lafihna, came asking for you! Seems your activities in all three nations have become your ticket to move up in the world, eh?${prompt}
  7822: Anyway, you should hurry on over to Heavens Tower. She's as strict on herself as she is on others!${prompt}
  7823: |-
    Semih Lafihna, eh?
    I don't know why, but I'm just not fond of that girl.${prompt}
  7824: Anyway, get a move on to Heavens Tower. She's strict on herself and on others!${prompt}
  7825: Oh, so look who gets to meet Semih Lafihna...${prompt}
  7826: Everyone always arrrgues over who's the better archer, Captain Rakoh Buuma or Semih Lafihna, y'know. But Captain Buuma is the best, of courrrse...well, at least that's what I think.${prompt}
  7827: Sibyl Guards aren't loved by the Mithra as a whole verrry much. We don't like people who take on fancy titles and think they're betterrr than the rest of the tribe.${prompt}
  7828: What's more, that Semih Lafihna is so serrrious and hard worrrking, her tail is so slim and shiny, and she's also such a know-it-all. Doesn't she just make you jealous?${prompt}
  7829: S-Sibyl G-Guards are the Mithra fighter-mighters who, who serve and protect the great Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  7830: M-most of the M-Mithra in Windurst serve their tribal chieftainness. So you see...Sibyl Guards are special-wecial, even in the Mithran society.${prompt}
  7831: This mission has been issued by the head lady-in-waiting of Heavens Tower, Zubaba.${prompt}
  7832: Not that I know much about her myself, but Zubaba has been serving as head lady-in-waiting since the current Star Sibyl was a child...${prompt}
  7833: She's not a character you dare keep waiting. I rrrecommend you hurry on over to Heavens Tower. If you fulfill a mission from the head lady-in-waiting well enough, it's bound to improve your rrreputation.${prompt}
  7834: This mission has been issued by the head lady-in-waiting, Zubaba.${prompt}
  7835: Seems that they were impressed by your efforts in your previous mission. If you want to keep in their good books, I suggest you rrrush on over to Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  7836: The head lady-in-waiting, Zubaba, is expecting you at Heavens Tower. Please proceed there immediately!${prompt}
  7837: If you complete this mission well, it's bound to improve your rrreputation. Do a good job, you hear?${prompt}
  7838: Tarutaru girls all want to become ladies-in-waiting, y'know? Like, what's wrrrong with them?${prompt}
  7839: Perrrhaps it's similar to how little Mithra girls go through a stage where they all want to grow up to become Huntresses of the Sun...I think.${prompt}
  7840: I hear there are many ladies-in-waiting who serve the Star Sibyl on the second floorrr of Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  7841: Sounds as though they do all the cleaning, washing and cooking there. Grrr...${prompt}
  7842: A, a mission from Z-Z-Zubaba!?${prompt}
  7843: "Wow! \nYou mean, Zubaba's still alivey-wivey?\nGee...${prompt}"
  7844: We have a formal writ of summons from Heavens Tower for you. One with a special star emblem on it signifies it is officially a mission of the utmost importance.${prompt}
  7845: It rrreads that you, ${name-player}, are to “make yourself present at the Planetarium of Heavens Tower with precipitate haste.” This is supposedly the greatest honor a citizen of Windurst can have.${prompt}
  7846: For a formal writ of summons to be issued from Heavens Tower means an extremely important announcement will be made.${prompt}
  7847: This also means you are no longer just a simple adventurer, my friend. Keep your wits about you! We'd like to escort you to your meeting, but alas, we are unable to rrright now.${prompt}
  7848: |-
    What's going on?
    What's this starrr emblem thingo?
    I don't underrrstand...I think.${prompt}
  7849: Miiri-Wohri's been carrying on all excitedly there by himself, y'know? I don't get it at all!${prompt}
  7850: |-
    I don't see how anyone can get so excited about a piece of paper. Paperrr's something that even goats eat.
    Totally worrrthless!${prompt}
  7851: "...Actually, I'm only saying that 'cause I'm jealous. I wish I got one of them wrrrits too! That's so cool! \nYou're so lucky!${prompt}"
  7852: I-It's the first time I saw the real thing! I was the one who took the delivery of your writ...so I was able to touch it!${prompt}
  7853: Wow! It's, it's, it's like I touched the hand of the Star Sibyl...only indirectly! Woooo! I'm sooo happy to be alivey-wivey!${prompt}
  7854: |-
    You haven't heard?
    An emergency order has been issued to the guards and a select few adventurers deemed most loyal to Windurst.${prompt}
  7855: The issuance of missions has been halted, pending further notice from Heavens Tower. Please stand by until then.${prompt}
  7856: |-
    You haven't heard?
    An emergency order has been issued to the guards and a select few adventurers deemed most loyal to Windurst.${prompt}
  7857: The issuance of missions has been halted pending further notice from Heavens Tower. Please stand by until then.${prompt}
  7858: Did you hearrr? Did you hearrr? Captain Rakoh Buuma was called to the Mage Academy, y'know?${prompt}
  7859: It's an emergency situation, so the captains of each of the fourrr guardhouses were asked to assemble. Sounds like they had a secrrret meeting or something...I think.${prompt}
  7860: Seems like something bad happened in the central towerrr of the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt}
  7861: Semih Lafihna, the Sibyl Guard, had a black look on herrr face as she ran by here en route to the Horutoto Ruins. Then she came back a little while ago looking even angrierrr!${prompt}
  7862: My! W-Windurst is in a state of emergency... I, I just hope nothing has happened to our blessed-wessed Star Sibyl!${prompt}
  7863: If, if anything were to happen to her, Windurst would be ruined! It's b-beyond the depths of despairy-wairy!${prompt}
  7864: |-
    This is a fearful matterrr!
    The wind is in turrrmoil.
    This porrrtends that something forrrmidable has occurred!${prompt}
  7865: In times like these you should not lend yourrr earrr to the buzz of people. Instead, you should train your spirit to listen to the grrreater voice around you...${prompt}
  7866: |-
    ......
    I sense something peculiar is going on. Something as big as naturrre, yet totally contrary to it, has descended upon these lands...${prompt}
  7867: An emergency mission addressed to you has been issued once again from Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  7868: You had better hurry to Heavens Tower and rrreceive your exact orders there. Seems as though you shall be traveling to the ends of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7869: The ancient rrruins of Fei'Yin...? I thought it was just the subject of fairy tales...${prompt}
  7870: Have you rrreceived your exact orders yet? If not, then you had better hurry on over to Heavens Tower to rrreceive them. Sounds like you'll be traveling to the ends of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7871: The ancient rrruins of Fei'Yin...? I thought it was just the stuff of fairy tales...${prompt}
  7872: What does our trrribal leader think of all this...I wonder?${prompt}
  7873: When the emergency situation arrrose, did the Star Sibyl inform our tribal leader? ...I don't know. I hope Heavens Tower didn't give our tribal leader the cold shoulder. I'd never forrrgive them for that!${prompt}
  7874: The talisman that disappeared from the Horutoto Ruins was supposed to have been separated between the three countrrries.${prompt}
  7875: Windurst notified the other two countries immediately, so theirrr talismans should be safe. I'm sure they'll up the guard once they've hearrrd what happened.${prompt}
  7876: It, it seems as though the Star Sibyl and her ladies-in-waiting are all safe and soundy-woundy.${prompt}
  7877: B-but I heard that some rogue broke into the Horutoto Ruins. Wasn't the talisman from the Great War of twenty years ago stored there...?${prompt}
  7878: I just rrreceived word that the conference of ministers has ended.${prompt}
  7879: 'Together with that announcement came another ${keyitem-singular: 4[2]} addressed to you. You had better rrrush on over to Heavens Tower again.${prompt}'

  7881: 'Together with that announcement came ${keyitem-article: 4[2]} addressed to you. You had better rrrush to Heavens Tower.${prompt}'
  7882: It's extrrremely rare for the five ministries to suddenly hold a meeting, y'know?${prompt}
  7883: It's prrractically impossible to gather the ministers of the five ministries together, so they usually announce these things months in advance...I think.${prompt}
  7884: The situation took a turn for the worrrse there, but it seems all-out warfarrre has been avoided.${prompt}
  7885: Oops...but that was meant to be a secrrret. We're not allowed to tell people about you-know-who being resurrrrected, or how war was about to break out... It would be widespread panic.${prompt}
  7886: I, I heard all sorts of nasty rumors about the meeting of the five ministries, but according to the fortune read by the Star Sibyl, Windurst's future is meant to be bright.${prompt}
  7887: |-
    So, so there's no need to worry.
    There's no way a war will break out.
    You, you can take my word for it!${prompt}
  7888: The ministerrr of the Orastery just went out through that gate, y'know?${prompt}
  7889: Maybe it has something to do with that starrr emblem letter from Heavens Tower...I think? I wonderrr what is written in those letters?${prompt}

  7893: M-Miss Apururu was so pleased, she let slip a little about what's been going on.${prompt}
  7894: I, I'm glad nothing really-weally bad ended up happening. Phew! Makes you appreciate the peace we have now.${prompt}

    Howdy! I'm a choco-gal!

  7898: Yee-haw! We're the choco-gals--the chicks who look after the chicks, if ya git what I'm sayin'. You heard about us from Quesse, didn'tchya?${prompt}

    Our chocobos just love their gysahl greens,

    Gee-whiz... I don't know...
    Can chocobos fly?
    If they can't, then why do they have wings...?${prompt}

  7905: Care to spare me an ear for a second, pardnerrr? You see, this one chocobo here hasn't been verrry well lately...${prompt}
  7906: I've got the poorrr thing resting up, but he doesn't seem to be getting any better...${prompt}
  7907: I consulted the apothecary, who said she'd make me her “secret cure-all medicament.”${prompt}
  7908: Yee-haw! Wouldn't that be grrreat, eh? My sick little boy will be all better then, thanks to that!${prompt}
  7909: Seeing as I have to stay and keep an eye on him, I was wonderrring if you would be so neighborly as to go to the Mithra apothecary and see if the medicament is ready or not...${prompt}

    The Mithra apothecary is nearrr the dhalmel farm. Please check and see how theirrr “secret cure-all medicament” is a-goin'.${prompt}
  7913: Hurry up and go to the apothecary, y'hearrr? This hyar sick chocobo is sweatin' his tailfeathers off while he's waitin' for that secret cure-all medicament!${prompt}
  7914: Why, that Mithra apothecary is very kind...even though she is a Mithra.${prompt}
  7915: I bet that's her motherly love showing itself. They say a woman changes once she has a child...${prompt}
  7916: You came from the Chocobo Stables, did you? So you're afterrr that secret cure-all of mine, then?${prompt}
  7917: 'The trrruth is, I lack a vital ingredient needed to make that medicament. It''s called ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  7918: 'Accorrrding to the staff of the dhalmel farm, there aren''t any ${item-plural: 1[2]} left in Sarutabaruta.${prompt}'

  7923: Now I can make my secret cure-all medicament. Thank you!${prompt}
  7924: Oh...and tell Kuoh Rhel back at the Chocobo Stables to hold on a little while longerrr.${prompt}
  7925: I'm starrrting to make the medicament now. So please tell Kuoh Rhel at the Chocobo Stables to hang in there forrr a little bit longer.${prompt}
  7926: "Now I see... \nThe apothecary was out of ingredients, so she had you go fetch them for her, huh?${prompt}"
  7927: Well, thank you for going through all that trrrouble. You've helped us out so verrry much. I'm just glad the little guy doesn't have to suffer much longerrr.${prompt}
  7928: Once my little chocobo friend here is back on his feet again, I intend to spoil him with his favorrrite treat!${prompt}
  7929: I do declare, that sickly chocobo is a bit different from them other chocobos.${prompt}
  7930: 'Why, his favorite meal is not ${item-plural: 2[2]} like normal chocobos, but the stew made by the chef at the Culinarians'' Guild. Isn''t that just the darndest-warndest?${prompt}'

    Howdy, pardnerrr!

  7936: Oh, fiddlesticks!${prompt}
  7937: You may recall I spoke with you about my sickly chocobo friend here before, pardnerrr?${prompt}
  7938: Well, that “secret cure-all medicament” from the apothecary finally came, but it's too darn bitter, so the silly bird won't swallow it!${prompt}
  7939: I've tried mixing it into his usual food, but he just won't touch it. I'm in a real fix!${prompt}
  7940: I finally got the “secret cure-all medicament” from the apothecary, but it's too darn bitter, so the silly bird won't swallow it!${prompt}
  7941: I've tried mixing it into his usual food, but he just won't touch it. I'm in a real fix!${prompt}

  7948: |-
    Thank you, pardnerrr!
    I bet if I mix some of that secret cure-all medicament into this stew, he'll gulp it down for surrre!${prompt}
  7949: Wow! Looks like it worked wonderrrs! Yee-haw! Just look at the little guy gobbling down his medicament!${prompt}
  7950: Here's a li'l token of my apprrreciation! Mighty obliged to you again, pardnerrr!${prompt}

  7952: Keep eating it up, boy, 'cause it'll make you well again, okay?${prompt}
  7953: I wonder why that chocobo turned all sickly in the first place? It don't look like no disease I've ever seen...${prompt}
  7954: P'haps he ate something that disagreed with him on one of his journeys? Say, did you know that there's some dang awful mushrooms in them San d'Orian lands?${prompt}
  7955: Why, once you've ate one of the consarned things, you just can't stop and eat more and more! It can git so bad, all you wanna eat's them mushrooms! Darn nasty-wasty work, thems!${prompt}

    This is the Boneworkers' Guild.
    As the name implies, this is wherrre we craft bone into all mannerrr of goods.${prompt}
  7957: Bone is lightweight but fragile in its naturrral state. Once you've learrrned the Mithra's boneworking methods, however, you'll be able to make weapons that are easy to handle and most effective.${prompt}
  7958: Allo-allo! If you're after boneworking materials, then make sure you buy them herey in Windurst! We're the cheapest in the whole wide worldy!${prompt}
  7959: Well, we're actually the same price as Jeuno...but if you consider how much it costs you to travel-wavel to Jeuno, we're not exactly lying then, are we?${prompt}
  7960: |-
    Oh, that Retto-Marutto...
    If he keeps carrying on while speaking to the customers, he'll get in trouble with the guildmaster again!${prompt}
  7961: Oops, then again, I'd betterrr show you what we've got in stock...${prompt}
  7962: Hidey-ho! This is the Boneworkers' Guild, if you haven't noticed, boneworking was originally a Mithra craft, so that's why there are so many Mithra here!${prompt}
  7963: When animals die, they leave theirrr bones behind. We forrrge their bones into arrowheads and use the arrows to fell other animals. Then when we eat those animals, theirrr bones remain to be used.${prompt}
  7964: It is all one great cycle wherrre nothing goes to waste.${prompt}
  7965: If you want to learn how to craft bone into something useful, then you should study with us here at the Boneworkers' Guild.${prompt}
  7966: It looks as if war is about to break out, so I foresee that we'll be short of hands.${prompt}
  7967: |-
    This is the Weavers' Guild.
    As you can see, skilled craftspeople are busy creataruing all kinds of fabrics, clothes and headwear.${prompt}
  7968: Windurst is famous for its magical cloth! Capes and hoods with all sorts of special properties are made out of such cloth here.${prompt}
  7969: Sew...I mean...“So,” want to get your paws on the top-quality materials as used in the Weaverrrs' Guild?${prompt}
  7970: Then step rrright up and take a look! Just be carrreful not to get too giddy with excitement, now!${prompt}
  7971: If you're interested in buying some works of art from our Weavers' Guild, then you've come to the right placey-wacey.${prompt}
  7972: |-
    We weave our own fabrics here.
    The materials used in our cloths can vary from grub's silk to plant fibers. Why, we even mix such materials together for the best of both worlds!${prompt}
  7973: "Um... \nMaybe it'll work if I do this and then do this... No. That won't do...! Humph...${prompt}"
  7974: You can't make quality fabrics unless you know the strengths and properties of your raw materials. The stockpiling of decades of wisdom is not limited to the realm of magic books, you know!${prompt}
  7975: |-
    I thought I'd learn myself a trade, so I joined the Weavers' Guild as an apprentice.
    They keep me busy day in and day out, but I guess that's how I'll improve.
    After all, they do say “you reap what you sew,” you know?${prompt}
  7976: |-
    This place is hanging by a thread!
    Naw... That was a fabrication! I was trying to pull the wool over your eyes.
    Hahaha... Just being a knitwit!♪${prompt}
  7977: This is the arrrchway to Windurst Walls, the hearrrtland of Windurst.${prompt}
  7978: In the centerrr of Windurst Walls is a giant star tree that grew out of and then encompassed Heavens Tower. That's where the Star Sibyl, who rules overrr our federation, lives.${prompt}
  7979: Head down this road to get to the harborrr area.${prompt}
  7980: Oh, and if you'rrre planning to board an airship, make sure you get there on time! The airrr travel agency doesn't wait for anyone!${prompt}
  7981: |-
    Arrrgh... I'm soo borrred!
    I wish something would happen to get my hot Mithran blood running again!${prompt}
  7982: 'How I envy adventurerrrs like you. What I''d give to be able to head out into East Sarutabaruta and blow up some ${color: 5}balloons${color: 1} forrr a bit of stress relief!${prompt}'
  7983: Mithra are purrretty good with their hands, you know? Why, we even give the Tarutaru a rrrun for their money! That's why there are so many guild buildings in Windurrrst Woods.${prompt}
  7984: By the way, up this path, you can see the Weaverrrs' Guild. Behind the Weavers' Guild is the Boneworkerrrs' Guild.${prompt}
  7985: If you can't find what you want at Nchaa's Good Goods shop up therrre, then try heading over to street stalls in the Bomingo Round.${prompt}
  7986: You might experience some serendipity therrre. There's one guy at the local restaurant who claims he always makes grrreat finds at those stalls.${prompt}
  7987: We Mithra may live freely, but we know rrright from wrrrong.${prompt}
  7988: That Cat Burglar, Nanaa Mihgo, may think she has everyone fooled with that cute act of hers, but a crrrook is a crrrook! Don't let yourself be taken in by herrr or herrr gang!${prompt}
  7989: Would you shut this little cub up for me? She is too pesky and noisy forrr her own good!${prompt}
  7990: The Sibyl Guards are not real Mithra because they werrre raised by Tarutaru! I don't carrre how strong they are. They've lost the Mithra spirrrit.${prompt}
  7991: Craft skills require you to practice overrr and overrr, wasting many items, until you learn how to synthesize and create things properrrly.${prompt}
  7992: But when you finally can create weapons and other cool stuff that aren't found at the shops, then it finally becomes worrrth all that efforrrt. At the very least, you can show off to your frrriends!${prompt}

  8012: You are free to look around, but we ask that you don't go teaching strange things to our newly created Cardians!${prompt}

  8014: |-
    Hm?
    You think our Cardians are odd? Well, I'd say you're the odd one around herey-werey!${prompt}
  8015: This is the Manustery--the ministry that's in charge of making and maintaining Cardians. Most people just refer to us as the “Cardian workshop.”${prompt}
  8016: The automaton guards you see working all over Windurst are born and raised by us here. Don'taru think it's kind of amazing, kid?${prompt}
  8017: I'm still newy around here, so they won't let me helpy out in creating Cardians yet.${prompt}

  8045: |-
    So hurry, hur～ry!
    You don't want someone else to beat you to it, and have their name go down in history instead of yours, do you?${prompt}
  8046: Cardians aren't people, you know-whow? They are like dolls made out of all sorts of materials. We place the magic on those dolls that breathes life into them.${prompt}
  8047: But each and every Cardian is an individual. The character of the person who casts the life-giving magic on them is reflected in their personalities, too!${prompt}
  8048: The Cardians that Kopuro-Popuro makes cause all sorts of trouble. We can't take our eyes off of them for too long...${prompt}
  8049: Minister Apururu is too soft on him. The future of our Manustery is bleak indeed!${prompt}
  8050: Mister Kopuro-Popuro mixes and matches the magicky he casts on Cardians in order to animatey them.${prompt}
  8051: The life-bringing magicky used on Cardians is extremely difficult to do. Wow, I hope if I keep practicing hard enoughy, I'll also be able to performy all sorts of variations of that magicky just like he does.${prompt}
  8052: Mighty obliged to you there, friend. Your name will go down in Windurstian history for sure now!${prompt}
  8053: So don't complain if your reward isn't as good as expected, kid.${prompt}
  8054: This is how we teach the Cardians we create to remember all kinds of things.${prompt}
  8055: I guess it's kind of like being their mother or father.${prompt}
  8056: Hey, you've come back here again?${prompt}
  8057: Oh well, seeing as you're here, you might as well make yourself useful. You see, I've just made another new type of Cardian. This time, I'm calling it...${prompt}
  8058: |-
    Ta～da～!!!
    “The All-New C-2000”!${prompt}
  8059: |-
    Huh...?
    Whaddayamean, “Yeah, yeah, I've heard it before?”${prompt}
  8060: Next you'll be telling me you know what items I want you to bring, rightaru? Anyway, I guess that means you'll be helping me out, then?${prompt}
  8061: |-
    Agree to help him out?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yeah.
    Naw.${prompt}
  8062: Gee...you don't have to be such a tease!${prompt}
  8063: |-
    Great!
    Head on out to Sarutabaruta and procure me those items, then!${prompt}
  8064: |-
    ONE'S★GREE-TING★IS...
    ONE'S★GREE-TING★IS...?${prompt}
  8065: |-
    What is Spare One's greeting?
    ${selection-lines}
    Gimme five!
    Hang ten, dood!
    Wassuuuuuup?${prompt}
  8066: |-
    ONE'S★GREE-TING★IS...
    GIMME★FIVE!${prompt}
  8067: |-
    ONE'S★GREE-TING★IS...
    HANG★TEN★DOOD!${prompt}
  8068: |-
    ONE'S★GREE-TING★IS...
    WASS★UUUUUUUUP?${prompt}
  8069: Don't go teachying that kiddy strange wordies! It's practically impossible to make Cardians forgety something once they memorizey it!${prompt}
  8070: That Spare Oney there is but a newborny Cardian! So he memorizes anythingy and everythingy without reservation.${prompt}
  8071: The other day Kopuro-Popuro went and taught one of our Kindercardianers the words “hats suck” and upset old Boizo-Naizo to no end.${prompt}
  8072: Newborn Cardians are just like ordinary people's children, so you have to teach them to use words properly-woperly!${prompt}
  8073: |-
    Hey, you therey!
    Remember that Cardiany you taught a silly greeting to the other day?${prompt}
  8074: That poor Cardiany just wouldn't forgety the words you taughty it.${prompt}
  8075: Seeing as it was you who taughty the poor thingy an inappropriate greeting, you should take responsibility for your actions and teachy him a correct way of greeting otheries!${prompt}
  8076: If somethingy's not done, he'll have to livey in embarrassment as a poorly-trained Cardian for the resty of his days. Wouldn't that be a pity-wity?${prompt}
  8077: |-
    Think it's pitiable?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, that's sad.
    Not really...${prompt}
  8078: |-
    You inhumane brutey!
    Have you no feelingies?${prompt}
  8079: As Cardians grow up and rise in ranky, their names changey. So, that Spare Cardian you spoke to backy then has a different namey that goes with the position he filledy.${prompt}
  8080: I think his namey is now Five of something-or-othery...?${prompt}
  8081: |-
    Well, I don't knowy...!?
    Their names changey so much, it's practically impossible to keep tracky of who's who!${prompt}
  8082: Anyway, try going aroundy and talking to the Cardians of each suit with the namey “Five,” and use the greeting you taught him as a signy to tell him apart from the otheries.${prompt}
  8083: The Cardian whose lifey you ruined by teaching him a silly greeting should now be named Five of something-or-othery...?${prompt}
  8084: Anyway, try going aroundy and talking to the Cardians of each suit with the namey “Five,” and use the greeting you taught him as a signy to tell him apart from the otheries.${prompt}
  8085: The Cardians of Windurst are dealt out numbers in the order that they are born. When their numerical predecessor breaks down, all the Cardians below him rise in rank to fill out the numbers of a full deck.${prompt}
  8086: So the more Cardians that become run-down or destroyed, the faster the numbers in the names of their successors change.${prompt}
  8087: Oh, you mean that Cardian...? So he's grown up to become number five already, huh?${prompt}
  8088: |-
    <Sigh>...
    When I hear that, it brings home to me just how short the lifespans of our Cardians are becoming...${prompt}
  8089: I believe that particular Cardian you speak of was made by Kopuro-Popuro.${prompt}
  8090: Kopuro-Popuro has a habit of forgetting important things while always remembering the most useless of information. Like father, like son, eh?${prompt}
  8091: |-
    So, did you findy him...?
    What do you meany, he's outsidey of town? Eh? He's that far away from towny?${prompt}
  8092: What's he doing in such a dangerous placey? We'd better hurry and send someone out to bring him backy! Here...takey this as a little thank-you for finding himy!${prompt}
  8093: If he stays outside of towny too long, there's a chance people might mistakey him for one of those feral Cardians and killy him!${prompt}
  8094: What's he doing in such a dangerous placey? We'd better hurry and send someone out to bring him backy!${prompt}
  8095: If he stays outside of towny too long, there's a chance people might mistakey him for one of those feral Cardians and killy him!${prompt}
  8096: What's he doing in such a dangerous placey? We'd better hurry and send someone out to bring him backy!${prompt}
  8097: It is true that the numbers the Cardians are called by change a lot lately, but we should not forget the individual students behind those names.${prompt}
  8098: This facility is different from schools where they teach people how to study-wudy. This is more like a home where we raise children in a loving way.${prompt}
  8099: Say...I wonder whether that Cardian properly forgot the “hats suck” line I taught him?${prompt}
  8100: I don't think we should force Cardians to forget things they don't want to forget.${prompt}
  8101: It wouldn't hurt for our Cardians to have a little more individuality now, would it?${prompt}
  8102: We're in deep water, everyone!${prompt}
  8103: We're in the red again this week.${prompt}
  8104: And after all of those cutbacks we've been implementing lately, too...${prompt}
  8105: I'd like to ask you all for ideas... How can we get some gil back into the Manustery's coffers?${prompt}
  8106: I know, Minister Apururu! It looks like it's time to implement “Legendary Plan B”!${prompt}
  8107: Legendary-wary?${prompt}
  8108: Plan B?${prompt}
  8109: Long, long ago, our old Manustery was facing a financial crisis much like we are today...${prompt}
  8110: This was in an age long before airships connected the cities of Vana'diel with the convenient network we have now.${prompt}
  8111: Back then, travelers on their way to Jeuno were menaced by fearsome nocturnal-wurnal monsters.${prompt}
  8112: To brighten up the future for those travelers, our predecessors, in their great wisdom, devised a charm for trekkers they called the “Gadabout's Gris-gris”!${prompt}
  8113: The effect of these charms was astounding, and the reduction in the number of dangerous incidents that befell Jeuno-bound travelers was significant.${prompt}
  8114: |-
    Hmm... Oh, really?
    Well, I don't know whether it's true or just an old wives' tale, but we could make a load of gil by selling such charms to the local goods stores, couldn'taru we?${prompt}
  8115: That was mighty useful information, especially coming from the likes of Kopuro-Popuro. So, how does one go about making these “Gadabout's Gris-gris” thingamabobs?${prompt}
  8116: Well, you need all kinds of items that nocturnal monsters drop when defeated.${prompt}
  8117: 'In order to make a charm, I think we just need: ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}'
  8118: |-
    I see... Great!
    Then we'll just make a heap of them to sell. We'll have money back in the Manustery's coffers in no time!${prompt}
  8119: You'll help us out as well, won'taru you? Please collect one of each of the items that the nocturnal monsters drop.${prompt}
  8120: 'Remember, we need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} to make one charm. Good luck, kiddo!${prompt}'
  8121: |-
    Hmm...
    That's the first I've heard of the Legendary Plan B.${prompt}
  8122: I didn't realize our ministry has been this poor for so long! I don't know whether I should take comfort from it, or fall into even further depression...${prompt}
  8123: So...I wonder how many of these “Gadabout's Gris-gris” thingamabobs we have to make to bring our budget back into the black.${prompt}
  8124: Well, finances aren't my concern, so I'll just concentrate on making the goods. I'll just keep making “Gadabout's Gris-gris” until we all drop from exhaustion.${prompt}
  8125: We've decided to go aheady with our Legendary Plan B--to make and sell special charmies that protect people who travel by nighty.${prompt}
  8126: The best thingy is that they don't require any special magicky--so long as we have the right materialies, they are easy to makey!${prompt}
  8127: 'Oh, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}... Looks likey we have everything!${prompt}'
  8128: |-
    Here's your cut...
    Good work, kid!${prompt}
  8129: We're in deep water, everyone!${prompt}
  8130: We have mountains of unsold stock! That means mountains of debt!${prompt}
  8131: Lately adventurers have been culling nocturnal monsters down to controllable levels, so traveling by night isn't as dangerous as it used to be. This means our charms aren't selling at all!${prompt}
  8132: I'm putting an end to Legendary Plan B. Now I've got to calculate how much more in the red we are after that harebrained scheme!${prompt}
  8133: Here...I'll give you one, too. Just get the silly thing out of my sighty-wighty!${prompt}
  8134: |-
    <Sigh>...
    I know, I know...you don't have to tell me. I should have realized this was a stupid idea earlier...${prompt}
  8135: |-
    I don't get it...
    What went wrong with Legendary Plan B?${prompt}
  8136: I know...I bet someone deliberately set out to interfere with my plan! Yeah, that's it. Someone must have employed adventurers to go out and hunt nocturnal monsters.${prompt}
  8137: It just goes to showy...if you have a fingery in more than one pie, you're going to get your fingers burnedy...${prompt}
  8138: That was a good lessony in the nature of businessy. There are pitfalls in diversification after all.${prompt}
  8139: |-
    Mountains of unsold stock!
    Mountains of debt!${prompt}
  8140: 'Minister Apururu!${wait-animation: 1}'
  8141: It's Queen of Hearts, Miss! She's come back all wounded and hurt!${prompt}
  8142: '!!!${prompt}'
  8143: You should stay there, kid. I think the minister is giving Queen of Hearts its last rites.${prompt}
  8144: |-
    Queen hAd a hap-py lifE...
    Under tHe Blue Skies...!${prompt}
  8145: Queen's Only Re-gret iS Queen oF Dia-monds dId not mAke iT back hEre tOo...!${prompt}
  8146: |-
    I understand, Queen of Hearts...
    Don't you worry about Queen of Diamonds. I'll look after her...${prompt}
  8147: Thank you for a long life of diligent service. Now you can rest in peace, my dear...${prompt}
  8148: I'm sorry for keeping you waiting, adventurer. A life had to return to the stars just now...${prompt}
  8149: She came back all the way here to me, despite her decrepit state...${prompt}
  8150: I'm just glad I was able to say a final farewell...${prompt}
  8151: |-
    Well, anyway, adventurer...
    You surely have traveled the world by now and seen many sad things yourself.${prompt}
  8152: 'I have a request for one such as you. Please tell me if you happen to find a Cardian named the Queen of Diamonds. I''ll pay you ${number: 1} gil for information about her whereabouts.${prompt}'
  8153: If she's on her way here too, then that can only mean she is seriously hurt as well. Please hurry and find her for me...${prompt}
  8154: 'I''ll pay you ${number: 1} gil for information on the whereabouts of a Cardian called the Queen of Diamonds.${prompt}'
  8155: If she's on her way here too, then that can only mean she is seriously hurt as well. Please hurry and find her for me...${prompt}
  8156: No mattery how many times you experience it, saying our last goodbyes to our Cardian kiddies is a sorrowful thingy.${prompt}
  8157: <sniff> It's all the more painfuly when it is a Cardiany you breathed life into and raised with your own handies. <sob> Waaah!${prompt}
  8158: The Cardian who died just then was one that Minister Apururu raised personally...${prompt}
  8159: That Cardian was able to make it back here with her remaining strength, but I fear Queen of Diamonds was not so lucky...${prompt}
  8160: Even if we only find one of her parts, at least we'll be able to give her a proper burial...${prompt}
  8161: |-
    What the...?
    She's offered to pay you ${number: 1} gil to find our missing Cardian? That's just the kind of stupid thing that puts us further and further into the red!${prompt}
  8162: If that Cardian's on its way back here, then it only means it's going to kick the bucket at any moment, rightaru?${prompt}
  8163: So why pay such a high price to find something as drop-dead useless as thataru!?${prompt}
  8164: It's like, why spend so much money on silly personal sentiments, when putting that gil towards creating a new Cardian is in everybody's interests?${prompt}
  8165: I'm sorry, but this time I'm going to have to put it to our Minister quite bluntly-wuntly!${prompt}
  8166: Even if you or anyone else finds old Queen of Diamonds for us, we won't be coughing up a single gil, I tell you! I'm totally against such tomfoolery!${prompt}
  8167: First, against nature, you go provide lifeforce to empty vessels. Then you send them out into the battlefields. If you're going to cry about it when they drop dead, then you'd might as well not make the damned things to begin with!${prompt}
  8168: Even if you or anyone else finds old Queen of Diamonds for us, we won't be coughing up a single gil, I tell you! I'm totally against such tomfoolery!${prompt}
  8169: I cannot read the marking, but this is a part of one of our children who left this ministry and died somewhere out there...${prompt}
  8170: Oh...?${prompt}
  8171: What's that I see on this starfruit?${prompt}
  8172: |-
    Look how it glitters so beautifully...
    And that shape...
    Why, it almost looks as if it's...${prompt}
  8173: a...${prompt}
  8174: |-
    Here.
    Please show this to Boizo-Naizo.${prompt}
  8175: Please show that starfruit to Boizo-Naizo.${prompt}
  8176: '......${prompt}'
  8177: Oh, that's worthless. Such garbage deserves to be thrown into the trashcan.${prompt}
  8178: Oh, I see you found a piece of her, huh? This nut is indeed part of what was once the great Queen of Diamonds.${prompt}
  8179: Its marking has worn away, but I know a diamond house when I see it. See, I'm the one who makes the Diamond Cardians, you know?${prompt}
  8180: But I don't intend to pay you a single gil! It's still worthless garbage, even if it was one of my own. I'm different from Minister Apururu, you see. I don't allow my feelings to get caught up in my work...${prompt}
  8181: |-
    ...Huh?
    What's this here...?${prompt}
  8182: Was this on the starfruit when you found it?${prompt}
  8183: |-
    This ice...!?
    Why, its shape looks...almost like...
    ...a tear...${prompt}
  8184: |-
    Ah...
    It's melting...${prompt}
  8185: |-
    ...
    Well, I guess the Minister did promise it to you, so...I'll pay you the reward for finding this starfruit.${prompt}
  8186: 'But ${number: 1} gil is asking too much. Sorry, but you''ll have to make do with ${number: 2} gil.${prompt}'
  8187: No, I've not become all emotional, mind you! It was just a doll into which we breathed temporary life, rightaru?${prompt}
  8188: First, against nature, you provide lifeforce to empty vessels. Then you go send them out into the battlefields. If you're going to cry about it when they drop dead, then you'd might as well not make the damned things to begin with!${prompt}
  8189: 'Did Boizo-Naizo really just dish out ${number: 2} gil just then?${prompt}'
  8190: I don't know where such an amount came from, as our Manustery certainly doesn't have that to spare... Ah!${prompt}
  8191: That's rightaru...he was just saying that he finally saved up enough gil to buy the latest hat creation from the hatter! You don'taru suppose he used that money to pay you, do you?${prompt}
  8192: Cardians are life forms born by borrowing the power of the stars. They are just like us--beings with a lifeforce that comes down from the heavens.${prompt}
  8193: |-
    So we should never forget...
    A Cardian's lifeforce is not something we created. We simply called that power down to the earth.${prompt}
  8194: That's why we should send off that life when it leaves the earth, telling it that we hope to meet again.${prompt}
  8195: |-
    Ice in the shapey of a tear...
    Ice that didn't melty until it touched the handies of Boizo-Naizo... There are many unexplainable mysteries in this worldy.${prompt}
  8196: |-
    Say...
    I wondery if Cardians can cry? There is no such devicey built into them to enabley them to, though...${prompt}
  8197: |-
    Haw!? Yeah, that be rrright!
    I look afterrr these here dhalmel all by m'self, y'know! Why, you ain't got an issue with that, do ya?${prompt}
  8198: |-
    Oh, and while y'all are herrre...
    Don't ya go taumentin' the poorrr things, now! Not if y'know what's good for ya!${prompt}
  8199: 'Lately them crrrawler crrritters out thar in Sarutabaruta have been eatin'' up all the ${item-plural: 2[2]} that these dhalmel love so much.${prompt}'
  8200: 'It''s put me in a rrreeeal fiddle, ''coz now I have to work rrreeeal hard to git me some of them thar ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  8201: I do declare... You seem to be the adventurrrer type now, huh!? Would you mind doin' me a favor the next time yer out thar a-huntin' in Sarutabaruta, and concentrate on depleting the numberrrs of crawlers in them parrrts?${prompt}
  8202: 'If ya cull enough of them crawlers to git your hands on three ${item-plural: 1[2]} or ${item-plural: 3[2]}, then I''ll give you a little somethin'' as a rrreward! Whaddaya say?${prompt}'
  8203: |-
    Help cull them thar crawlers?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yup!
    Naw!${prompt}
  8204: |-
    I see...
    So, y'don't give a damn 'bout what happens to my dhalmel, then do ya? You yellow-strrreaked crrrawler-kisser, you!${prompt}
  8205: Crawlers can be found in both East and West Sarutabaruta. So exterrrminate as many of them thar pesty crrritters as you can in both'a them parts.${prompt}
  8206: 'Them crawlers are out of control, and I''m at my wit''s end! Cull enuff of them critters to git your hands on three ${item-plural: 1[2]} or ${item-plural: 3[2]}, and I''ll pay you a rrreward!${prompt}'

  8208: |-
    Why, thankee you, pardnerrr!
    Seems like y'did indeed kill off a mighty big numberrr of them thar crawlers. Here's ya rrreward! Much obliged to ya.${prompt}
  8209: 'If everrr ya have the time, would ya be so good as to cull some morrre of them thar crawlers for little ol'' me? Cull enuff of them critters to git your hands on three ${item-plural: 1[2]} or ${item-plural: 3[2]}, and I''ll pay you a handsome rrreward!${prompt}'
  8210: You saw them towerrrs out thar in Sarutabaruta, huh? Why, they be called the Horutoto Ruins. Once they broke down, the animals of Sarutabaruta starrrted runnin' amuck, y'know?${prompt}
  8211: I ain't got much of a clue what them towers was forrr, but they sure was magical. I wonderrr if they'll e'er be able to fix them up again?${prompt}
  8212: In Mother Nature, there is nothing that is without purrrpose...nothing is wasted. Both you and I are here for some rrreason.${prompt}
  8213: One should never waste naturrre's gifts, and never take a life, no matter how small, without properrr cause. That is the hunting code we rangers are sworn to uphold.${prompt}
  8214: Please do not botherrr us now. We are in the midst of offerrring our prayers for a great hunt.${prompt}
  8215: We rangers must show gratitude for naturrre's blessings as we carry out the hunt. For we too are part of Mother Nature's grrreater scheme...${prompt}
  8216: Have you everrr thought about how the food you eat each day arrives on your plate?${prompt}
  8217: Yes. When we die, we too will be eaten by someone or something. In the end, we all returrrn to the earth to serve as nutrients for otherrr living things.${prompt}
  8218: You are entering into the prrresence of Chieftainness Perih Vashai, the one who unifies the Mithra of Windurst.${prompt}
  8219: Verily, she is the Mithran heroine who wields the crrrimson arrow and the azure bow. Be carrreful, lest you are overwhelmed by her peaceful vigor.${prompt}
  8220: Blessed is the one with the crimson tides flooding through herrr breast and the azure glow beaming from herrr eyes.${prompt}
  8221: Forrr only one such as that may inherit the chieftainness's bow and arrow.${prompt}
  8222: I brought my daughterrr here to meet the tribal chieftainness, and have herrr highness see just how the child is grrrowing.${prompt}
  8223: The chieftainness inculcated my daughter on the Mithra spirit--the teachings of a people in harrrmony with naturrre. This is just as my motherrr had done forrr me.${prompt}
  8224: Wanna know why the chieftainness keeps herrr eyes closed all the time?${prompt}
  8225: It's so she can hearrr the voice of naturrre betterrr!${prompt}
  8226: |-
    Have you hearrrd, adventurer?
    Our world is once again in an uproarrr.${prompt}
  8227: We are on the path to great wars and the spilling of much blood. If those times do indeed come, I shall be forrrced to hand the bow of the chieftainness on to a Mithra who has found a new road to walk, one who has new drrreams for her people.${prompt}
  8228: We have received worrrd from Rakoh Buuma, captain of the eastern gatehouse.${prompt}
  8229: We are afraid it is ratherrr ill news. Nothing good happens on days when the wind blows warrrm.${prompt}
  8230: What we fearrr is about to happen is by no means certain. However, if our worst fears come to pass, then we will need a strong chieftainness who can rrraise the lands and lead our arrrmies.${prompt}
  8231: We cannot ask this of our elderrrly chieftainness. Will we need to select a new leaderrr even while our current chieftainness still lives...?${prompt}
  8232: Have you hearrrd, adventurer? There appears to have been a grrreat battle far off in the Northlands.${prompt}
  8233: I assume the worrrld will quiet down for a while now. However, the hearts of the Mithra will continue to clamorrr, for we Mithra know that nothing has rrreally ended at all.${prompt}
  8234: Why? Why is it that my hearrrtbeat will not settle down?${prompt}
  8235: Lo! The chieftainness appearrrs to be sensing something. What is going to happen next?${prompt}
  8236: No one is willing to say it out loud, but we all feel that something is about to occurrr.${prompt}
  8237: It was exactly the same twenty years ago. There was a grrreat sense of loss back then, as if some grrrand presence had suddenly disappeared. But what was it that was lost?${prompt}
  8238: In Mother Nature, there is nothing that is without purrrpose...nothing is wasted. Both you and I are here for some rrreason.${prompt}
  8239: One should never waste naturrre's gifts, and never take a life, no matter how small, without properrr cause. That is the hunting code we rangers are sworn to uphold.${prompt}
  8240: Have you, my child, trod on many a land, drunk from many a rrrainfall, fought many a fine battle, and lived to see many a dawn?${prompt}
  8241: Then truly I say unto you, unless you are apprrroved by the earth and the sky, how is it that you can say you are accepted by Mother Nature?${prompt}
  8242: If you so desire to submit yourself to the laws of naturrre, my child, then go, meet with the fanged king of the beasts, and bring back one of his grrreat teeth.${prompt}
  8243: Listen to the voice of nature and wait for nature to run herrr course. If nature accepts us, then even we who lack fangs will be perrrmitted to hunt as her rangers.${prompt}
  8244: My child, if you desire to submit yourself to the laws of naturrre, then go, meet with the fanged king of the beasts, and bring back one of his grrreat teeth.${prompt}
  8245: Listen to the voice of nature and wait for nature to run herrr course. If nature accepts us, then even we who lack fangs will be perrrmitted to hunt as her rangers.${prompt}
  8246: The fanged king of the beasts is one of the grrreat tigers. It is a fearsome monster with swift feet and awesome power. Its teeth are very light yet extremely strong, perrrfect for making the best arrowheads.${prompt}
  8247: From long ago they have dwelled on the Sauromugue Champaign, and we have learrrned much from them.${prompt}
  8248: What is it you want to learrrn from us, the people of nature?${prompt}
  8249: While you say you want to leave some legacy for the futurrre, you plunderrr whatever you can here and now.${prompt}
  8250: If you stopped for a moment and thought, you would rrrealize that at this rate you will have nothing left to give yourrr descendants.${prompt}
  8251: Those who say they want to leave some legacy for the future, while plunderrring whatever they can here and now, live contrary to nature.${prompt}
  8252: If they stopped for a moment and thought, they would rrrealize that at this rate they will have nothing left to give theirrr descendants.${prompt}
  8253: Why, my child, did you cause yet anotherrr of nature's wonderrrs to die meaninglessly? It is useless to even try and explain this fang's meaning to one such as you.${prompt}
  8254: For the hunterrr, the fangs are not just a tool vital for existence, but also a witness to its death. If the fanged one loses its fangs, it can no longerrr live. Yet when the fanged one dies, only its fangs rrremain.${prompt}
  8255: To hunt like the fanged one, you must live by the fang and die leaving only the fang behind.${prompt}
  8256: Onto you, our new ranger, I bestow the witness of the life and death of the grrreat fanged one...${prompt}
  8257: You can now become a ranger!${prompt}
  8258: The one unto whom Mother Nature has bestowed her fangs must neverrr fight without reason.${prompt}
  8259: Glorrry to the fangs of the fanged one. Listen to the voice of nature and follow her courrrse. The sky and earrrth shall tell you the time to fight and the time to die.${prompt}
  8260: Why do you suppose people lost their fangs? Perrrhaps it was because people stopped listening to nature's voice.${prompt}
  8261: That weapon you hold in your hands is but a temporrrary manifestation of a fang. Your true fangs exist within your hearrrt!${prompt}
  8262: There are no meaningless lives in this worrrld, yet there are a great numberrr of meaningless deaths.${prompt}
  8263: |-
    Never forrrget, fanged one...
    Never forrrget the sinfulness and folly of causing an unnecessary death.${prompt}
  8264: |-
    Hey! What do you want?
    Don't tell me...${prompt}
  8265: You heard that I have a monster correlation chart and came to beg me to show it to you, rrright?${prompt}
  8266: |-
    Look at the tattered diagram?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  8267: Oh, so you're just trying to flirt with me, huh? Well, sorry there, but I'm not interrrested in men or women. The only thing that makes my heart leap are the tracks and droppings of my next hunting game, thank you.${prompt}
  8268: |-
    I knew it!
    Alrrright then. I don't mind showing it to you. Besides, I'm a topnotch hunter, so I don't need it anyway.${prompt}
  8269: I was given this parchment a few years ago by a scrrruffy old Elvaan man. I helped him out when I found him lost in the woods, and this was his way of paying me back.${prompt}
  8270: To tell you the truth, I wasn't that interested in it, so I didn't pay much attention to his explanation and have forrrgotten most of what he said.${prompt}
  8271: It was something about how the different types of monsters eat each other in order to surrrvive, so I guess he was trying to tell me to referrr to this pattern when I go hunting.${prompt}
  8272: But whenever I spot a monster, I become totally obsessed by the thought of the hunt and forrrget all about his advice and this chart.${prompt}
  8273: Maybe it's enough to just keep this knowledge locked away in the back of your mind somewhere, in case you ever need it. But if you want to know more, then you'll just have to go and track down that old guy.${prompt}
  8274: You're welcome to have another gander at this chart whenever you want to. It's a pain to explain it to everyone who asks, but maybe it is some kind of fate... Actually, I've found that I enjoy helping people out.${prompt}
  8275: Through this archway lies Windurst's residential area. There is a Mog House room preparrred for your use in there.${prompt}
  8276: |-
    Say...
    You haven't had Mog Houses explained to you beforrre? Well then, allow me to fill you in!${prompt}
  8277: |-
    Listen to Mog House explanation?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  8278: A Mog House is your own perrrsonal apartment room provided for your convenience.${prompt}
  8279: Within your Mog House, you can storrre items, change jobs, and heal your HP and MP.${prompt}
  8280: |-
    You're a citizen of Windurst, right?
    Then there's no hassle. You should already have a Mog House preparrred for you up the stairs here.${prompt}
  8281: It's your own room, so you can use it however you see fit. Why don't you go up there now and take a little nap to refrrresh yourself?${prompt}
  8282: Through this archway lies Windurst's residential area. There is a Mog House room preparrred for your use in there.${prompt}
  8283: |-
    Say what...?
    You want to hearrr my explanation of Mog Houses again, do you?${prompt}
  8284: |-
    Oh well...
    Yourrr loss.${prompt}
  8285: Through this archway lies Windurst's residential area. There is a Mog House room preparrred for your use in there.${prompt}
  8286: |-
    Let me see...
    You currently have a Rent-a-Room leased out in ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Kazham/Rabao/Norg/Al Zahbi], rrright?${prompt}
  8287: 'Do you want me to returrrn the Rent-a-Room in ${choice: 0}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Kazham/Rabao/Norg/Al Zahbi], and have your belongings brought back to your Mog House here in Windurst?${prompt}'
  8288: |-
    Move out of Rent-a-Room?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  8289: 'Ho-hum...ho-hum... There, it''s all settled. The keys to your Rent-a-Room in ${choice: 0}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Kazham/Rabao/Norg/Al Zahbi] have been returrrned. Have a pleasant rest.${prompt}'
  8290: Beyond this arrrchway is Windurst's residential area, where there are Mog Houses and Rent-a-Rooms available for people's use.${prompt}
  8291: Say what...? You already have a Rent-a-Room! In that case, you can go directly into your room. You don't have to come and get perrrmission from me every time, you know?${prompt}
  8292: Beyond this arrrchway is Windurst's residential area, where there are Mog Houses and Rent-a-Rooms available for people's use.${prompt}
  8293: Let me see... You're not a citizen of Windurst, rrright? In that case, do you want me to prepare a Rent-a-Room for you here?${prompt}
  8294: When you lease a Rent-a-Room here, you can use that room as you would use your own personal Mog House back in your home country. Prrretty convenient, huh?${prompt}
  8295: |-
    Lease a Rent-a-Room?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  8296: Ho-hum...ho-hum... There, it's all settled. You now have your own Rent-a-Room preparrred for your use in Windurst's residential area behind me. Have a pleasant stay.${prompt}
  8297: What's up with you? Why are you standing there in a daze?${prompt}
  8298: Hmm... You call yourself an adventurrrer? I guess if one stretches her imagination enough, you could almost look like one.${prompt}
  8299: Let me take a stab in the darrrk and guess that this is your first time in Windurst.${prompt}
  8300: |-
    First time in Windurst?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  8301: |-
    Well then, welcome...
    Yes, welcome to peaceful old Windurrrst. Scaredy-cats who have been dumbed down by the peace are enthusiastically received here.${prompt}
  8302: |-
    Good try...
    But if you're going to deceive people, you should at least learn how to lie properrrly.${prompt}
  8303: |-
    Where are you heading?
    What brings you to town?${prompt}
  8304: |-
    What do you want to do right now?
    ${selection-lines}
    Head outside and battle.
    Go shopping.
    Gather information.
    Where am I? Who am I?${prompt}
  8305: Grrr... You'rrre more hot-blooded than you look. I could almost come to like you.${prompt}
  8306: But judging from your delicate appearrrance, I'd say you'd be lucky to beat a rarab, let alone a mandragorrra, out there in Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  8307: Oh, in case you didn't know, Sarutabaruta is the name of the grasslands that surround Windurst.${prompt}
  8308: If you go back up that slope behind you and pass through the gatehouse, you will come to East Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  8309: Sarutabaruta is full of weak monsters, so even a newbie like you can try to hunt there.${prompt}
  8310: |-
    But be warrrned.
    The furrrther you go away from town the strongerrr the monsters become, so keep an eye on your map.${prompt}
  8311: Ask your fellow adventurers for details on the best way to fight or flee. I can't be botherrred telling you myself.${prompt}
  8312: Well, I've helped you enough forrr today. I'm sure you get the idea.${prompt}
  8313: Nanaa Mihgo's lesson on Windurst is overrr. I've discounted your tuition fee to a mere 1000 gil. Come on then, cough it up.${prompt}
  8314: |-
    Pay the tuition fee?
    ${selection-lines}
    No way!
    Well, er, okay...${prompt}
  8315: What!? You won't pay me even a simple compliment, despite my kindly assistance!? Don't you know basic adventurrrer's etiquette?${prompt}
  8316: Show me how much you've got in your purrrse.${prompt}
  8317: You catch on quick, kid. I'm beginning to think I could like you.${prompt}
  8318: Hold it right there!${prompt}
  8319: |-
    Nanaa Mihgo!!!
    You're up to your old tricks of duping travelers out of their hard-earned gil, aren't you?${prompt}
  8320: We, the “Star Onion Brigade,” won't let you get away with it!${prompt}
  8321: |-
    Grrr, not those S.O.B.'s again!
    I would've gotten away with it, if it weren't for you meddling kids!${prompt}
  8322: Due to this disturrrbance, I'll have to end your lesson forrr today!${prompt}
  8323: We'll continue anotherrr day, and that's when I'll collect my fee.${prompt}
  8324: |-
    Hey, she's getting away!
    After her!${prompt}
  8325: He～y, don't run so fasty-wasty!${prompt}
  8326: <Sigh>......${prompt}
  8327: Dat mithwa is a weally bad mithwa we all call da Cat Burglar.${prompt}
  8328: If you need weal help, head towards da fountain. Jack of Spades is on guard around dere. He will teach you all you need to know. Check da “Map” to find da way dere.${prompt}
  8329: |-
    Oh, and give Jack dis.
    You can give it to him by using da main menu's “Trade” option.${prompt}
  8330: Ah, we forgot to intwoduce ourselves. We are da Star Onion Bwigade! We are da pwotectors of a bwighter tomorrow! It'll pay you to wemember us!${prompt}
  8331: |-
    What the...? Shopping?
    Asking me's a waste of time.${prompt}
  8332: I mean a waste of my time, not yourrrs! If you must ask, then all I can recommend is to head to Port Windurst.${prompt}
  8333: To get there, head down the road on the otherrr side of this fountain round.${prompt}
  8334: Once in the porrrt, head down to the wharves, where there are three boat-shaped shops. They house a magic shop, an armor shop, and a weapon shop.${prompt}
  8335: If you're looking for shops in the Windurst Woods area, there's a general goods store far over on the otherrr side of those tents there. You'll find the Boneworkers' Guild and Weavers' Guild shops back behind therrre too!${prompt}
  8336: And up behind the dhalmel farm, therrre's a Mithra apothecary.${prompt}
  8337: You should know this already, but you can make money by selling the items that monsters drop after you defeat them. You can use the gil earrrned to buy whatever you want.${prompt}
  8338: The best way to gather inforrrmation is to speak to all the townsfolk.${prompt}
  8339: Today I'll throw in some special tidbits for free...but just this once. What kind of information in particularrr are you interested in?${prompt}
  8340: |-
    Ask for information on...?
    ${selection-lines}
    Helping people.
    Monster patrol.
    Easy money.
    Looking for work.${prompt}
  8341: Why not try the Manustery's Cardian worrrkshop up there? You won't only be helping people, but Cardians as well.${prompt}
  8342: Oh, Cardians are the magical automatons that function as the guarrrds of Windurst.${prompt}
  8343: If you go in that workshop there, you'll see morrre of them than you probably want to.${prompt}
  8344: Perrrsonally, I'd prefer if all the Cardians were rounded up and destroyed.${prompt}
  8345: Hah! If therrre was such sweet talk of fast money, I'd have done it already.${prompt}
  8346: |-
    But wait a second.
    Let me see... What could be suitable for a newbie like you...?${prompt}
  8347: You know the Boneworrrkers' Guild to the south of here? If you diligently practice that trade skill, you might make some money out of synthesizing and selling items.${prompt}
  8348: You'rrre not going to strike it rich right away, but it's a relatively easy way to make money. Hey, it's a start, right?${prompt}
  8349: Norrrmally, I'd say, “Go out and slaughter those Yagudo beastmen”!${prompt}
  8350: But the Tarutaru of Windurrrst like to keep the peace and are trying to be friends with the Yagudo.${prompt}
  8351: So at this point, all I can recommend to you is the dhalmel farrrm.${prompt}
  8352: If you head north from here, you'll see the long necks of the dhalmel sticking up over the farrrm's walkway. Inquire with the farrrmer. She's grateful for any help she can get.${prompt}
  8353: Looking for worrrk, huh? Then head to one of the gatehouses.${prompt}
  8354: There's one right behind you. The stone building there is the Eastern Gatehouse. It's swarrrming with those preening Mithra guards.${prompt}
  8355: You can receive missions from the gatehouses if you're into volunteerrring for your country. Perrrsonally, I don't care much for it myself, so ask for details at the gatehouse.${prompt}
  8356: Missions are tasks from and on behalf of the Federation of Windurst, and differrr from the requests for help from general townsfolk.${prompt}
  8357: For instance, if you do so-and-so a mission, you are rewarrrded with a set number of rank points.${prompt}
  8358: Collect enough rank points and your rank or position in this country will rise. But as far as I'm concerned, the rewards aren't worrrth the effort.${prompt}
  8359: Hm? You don't know left from right? You poorrr thing.${prompt}
  8360: This is Windurst Woods, the easternmost of the fourrr districts of Windurst.${prompt}
  8361: Seeing as we're nearrr the Bomingo Round here, I'll use it as the starting point of my explanation.${prompt}
  8362: Firrrst, if you head south from the round, there are several shops run by the local craftswomen.${prompt}
  8363: There's the Weavers' Guild, which is the specialty of the Tarutaru, and there's the Boneworkers' Guild. which is more the Mithra's forte. These are the pride and joy of Windurst.${prompt}
  8364: If you head north from the round, you'll find roads that lead to the dhalmel farm and Chocobo Stables. Just follow the sweet smell of naturrre.${prompt}
  8365: Take the road norrrth, and you'll find an apothecary mixed among the Mithra Groves with the Mithra houses. Take the road south, and you'll find an auction house.${prompt}
  8366: Compared to the other districts, there's hardly any Tarutaru buildings in Windurst Woods at all. However, the Manustery, one of the five ministries, is right therrre.${prompt}
  8367: That building up high there is the Manustery's Cardian workshop. It's where those Cardian guards are manufacturrred.${prompt}
  8368: Finally, heading west from the round will take you to Windurst's residential area.${prompt}
  8369: If you're a citizen of Windurst, you can use one of the Mog Houses inside of therrre.${prompt}
  8370: Ask the guards at the entrance there forrr the details.${prompt}
  8371: |-
    Why, hello there, adventurer.
    I have a puzzling little problem you might be able to help me with...${prompt}
  8372: 'A while ago, I came into the possession of something called ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, which has given me the spooks.${prompt}'
  8373: I've heard that its previous owners have all had the most bizarre things happen to them.${prompt}
  8374: I've tried to get rid of the damned thing, but somehow it keeps making its way back to me. So...I was wondering if you can do something about this ribbon before I go quite crazy.${prompt}
  8375: |-
    Help Roberta with her ribbon?
    ${selection-lines}
    Accept.
    Decline.${prompt}
  8376: Don't tell me you're too scared! Why, you looked like the type who could help an old lady.${prompt}
  8377: I'm almost afraid to get you caught up in this business as well, but thank you for agreeing to help me out. Handle it with care, now...${prompt}
  8378: Why, hello again, adventurer. I still have that puzzling little problem you were supposed to be helping me out with...${prompt}
  8379: 'Remember that ${item-singular: 1[2]} I gave you? Well, by any chance, did you happen to lose it?${prompt}'
  8380: |-
    Lost the ribbon?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  8381: |-
    I knew it! I knew it!
    You won't believe this, but that ${item-singular: 1[2]} I gave you somehow made its way back to me again!${prompt}
  8382: Please. I beg you. Do something about this ribbon before it drives me crazy!${prompt}
  8383: "Really? \nHmm... No matter then...${prompt}"
  8384: |-
    Hey ${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Ma'am]...
    Are you going to take me home...?${prompt}
  8385: That ribbon is not for sale, and I certainly wouldn't buy it back from anyone. Yet, somehow it manages to come back here to me. What's going on...?${prompt}
  8386: That ribbon is not for sale, and I certainly wouldn't buy it back from anyone. Yet, somehow it manages to come back here to me. What's going on...?${prompt}
  8387: You don't have to tell me anything about the background of that ribbon. I don't want to know.${prompt}
  8388: In this weird world of ours, some things are better left unknown.${prompt}
  8389: So...you've found me, huh? Yeah, I know, I know. Don't tell me--our editor, old Naiko-Paneiko, is all in a huff over wanting us to cough up our news scoops, rightaru?${prompt}
  8390: Hmm... What should I do? You see, I have a great scoop, but haven't been able to confirm whether it is indeed true or notaru.${prompt}
  8391: So I could let you just take it to him, but a good reporter should always double-check her sources, rightaru?${prompt}
  8392: Say, perhaps you could check my story out, and go see if the facts match up before you submitaru it to him? Maybe you could also get a few other adventurers to help you out and serve as witnesses...?${prompt}
  8393: To finish your job by confirming my news scoop, head into the depths of the eastern magic tower and find out whether the Cat Burglar's hideaway really does existaru there.${prompt}
  8394: I don'taru suggest that you actually go inside her hideaway, as the Cat Burglar is bound to have dangerous traps and guards there. Just find the entrance to the place at the back of the Horutoto Ruins...then get the hell outta there!${prompt}
  8395: I knew it! My sources were correctaru! Race on back to my editor with the scoop before someone else beats us to it!${prompt}
  8396: This year's Pulitzer-Bulitzer Prize for journalism is in my pocket for sure! I'll make sure I thank you in my acceptance speech!${prompt}
  8397: |-
    The Cat Burglar-wurglar...?
    Oh, you mean Nanaa Mihgo?
    Of course I know her!${prompt}
  8398: They say the treasures she steals from people are never-ever found again. That's why the Mithra guardy-wardies can never arrest her...there's just no proof!${prompt}
  8399: |-
    As I thoughtaru!
    I won this year's Pulitzer-Bulitzer Prize for journalism with my scoop on the Cat Burglar!${prompt}
  8400: And it's all thanks to you for helping confirm that it was true. I really want to thank you more, but will this do...?${prompt}
  8401: I can'taru wait to see our next exclusive issue.${prompt}
  8402: My exposé will be the top story for sure. But I can'taru rest on my laurels. A good reporter has to keep following the truth, as no story ever really ends.${prompt}
  8403: Can't you see I'm busy now? Give a girl a little brrreathing room, huh?${prompt}
  8404: You did put the you-know-what into a metal box and sink it in the sea as we were told to, didn't you?${prompt}
  8405: You've got a cat's chance in hell of getting me to steal something like that again! Next time, you do the stealing, and I do the sinking, okay?${prompt}
  8406: |-
    Oo～h... Aa～h... Ou～ch...!
    I don't think our last burrrglary was such a good idea. The wounds where I was bitten by the you-know-what still ache, not to mention my back from carrying that heavy box I put it in.${prompt}
  8407: What do you mean, my scoop exposé has been stolen!?${prompt}
  8408: That dirty, rotten, low-down Cat Burglar! She's made a preemptive strike so as not to be caught outaru. This is a cat-astrophe!${prompt}
  8409: Looks like this week's edition of the Tarutaru Times's “Magic Paradise Weekly” is going to be canceled as well.${prompt}
  8410: If I said it once, I've said it a thousand times... We should give up on using those silly magic dolls to deliver our stories. and go back to the tried and true method of newspapers and magazines! Our stories always end up never getting told.${prompt}
  8411: |-
    What...?
    You've brought a Cardian that you want me to have a looky-wooky at?${prompt}
  8412: |-
    I see...
    Such a misfortunate episode has caused the poor thing to cease functioning.${prompt}
  8413: The Mana Orb--the heart of this Cardian--is still glowing. This is not a mere case of magic energy depletion. This child's heart has been broken-woken.${prompt}
  8414: Cardians are automaton dolls created with the help of magic, but their ability to perceive emotions is the same as us people.${prompt}
  8415: Feelings are something transmitted between people as they gradually grow older. Cardians also develop by picking up many such feelings but, but...sometimes these feelings can even break them.${prompt}
  8416: This Cardian you brought me was made during the war years, so it has probably felt its fair share of sorrow over its lifetime.${prompt}
  8417: |-
    <Sigh>...
    I wonder if I can heal the poor thingy-wingy?${prompt}
  8418: This is not one of the Cardians that I helped create. But...these poor children are still my responsibility...${prompt}
  8419: I'll... I'll try to re-enchant the magic back into it.${prompt}
  8420: But I'll need help to carry it out. Would you be so good as to assist me?${prompt}
  8421: |-
    Help fix the Cardian?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes. Anything to help!
    Sorry, I can't.${prompt}
  8422: |-
    Thank you for your cooperation.
    First, I'll need to remove my father's old magic. He was the previous Minister of the Manustery who created this Cardian.${prompt}
  8423: In order to do that, I'll need to pair it off with its opposing Cardian Card--the ten of cups. I only need a single ten of cups card, so could you be so good as to obtain one for me?${prompt}
  8424: Some of the old type of Cardians--who are now malfunctioning and breaking down--run wild in the southwestern parts of the Horutoto Ruins. That would be the best place to search. But please be very careful-wareful!${prompt}
  8425: That's too bady-wady...<sniff>${prompt}
  8426: 'The Ten of Cups is the opposing card to our poor little Cardian friendy-wiendy. If you bring me ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, I can remove the old magic from him and commence my repairs.${prompt}'
  8427: Some of the old-style Cardians that have long malfunctioned run wild in the southwestern parts of the Horutoto Ruins of West Sarutabaruta. Try searching there. But please be very careful-wareful!${prompt}
  8428: The magic that we use to breathe life into the automaton dollies can be very dangerousy if used incorrectly.${prompt}
  8429: It hasn't been as thoroughly researched or perfected as black or white magicy. Often its very use puts the caster herselfy in dangery.${prompt}
  8430: Cardian Cards have the ability to dispel the magic that has been placed on Cardians...it's kind of like an emergency stop or self-destruct button.${prompt}
  8431: Minister Apururu's father, the previous minister of our Manustery, could even remove magic without the use of Cards...but without him to show us, it's impossible for us to do it.${prompt}
  8432: There are many taboos when one breathes life into these automaton dolls, you know, kid?${prompt}
  8433: One very important rule is to never cast a second batch of magic on a doll that already has magic placed on it. If you're not careful, either you or the doll could die! Shivers!${prompt}
  8434: |-
    Oh, goody-woody!
    You found it!${prompt}
  8435: Now you can leave the rest to me. You can tell this child's friends back in Jeuno that it will be a little while longer before he's as good as new.${prompt}
  8436: |-
    But...
    I need to wipe his Mana Orb clean in order to begin... I must clean away the memories that broke his heart...${prompt}

    I...

  8439: |-
    Ooh, scary-warey!
    Don'ty you go disturbingy Minister Apururu now!${prompt}
  8440: The magic needed to breathe lifey into a Cardian are all very delicate operationies. She has to keepy her concentration, she does!${prompt}
  8441: The minister is so determined-wermined. I don'taru want her to go through with this, but it looks like nothing would stop her now.${prompt}
  8442: She tends to get carried away when it comes to matters about her father. We have to look out for her as much as we can!${prompt}
  8443: There are many taboos when one breathes life into these automaton dolls, you know, kid?${prompt}
  8444: One very important rule is to never cast a second batch of magic on a doll that already has magic placed on it. If you're not careful, either you or the doll could die! Shivers!${prompt}
  8445: Wot's that you sez? Give you back the book I borrrrowed from the library?${prompt}
  8446: Why, I always returrrn any books I borrow right on time, thank you! You sure you ain't got the wrong girrrl? Why would they think I've still got a book out?${prompt}
  8447: |-
    Yo～wl! Wot's that...?

    Woowee...!
    We overhearrrd you! Seems our boss has a darrring side to her after all!♪${prompt}
  8451: |-
    Woow-woo! You go, girl!
    Looks like our boss's sprrring has come at last! She doesn't have to deny it so much. Being a closet rrromantic is nothing to be ashamed of...${prompt}
  8452: |-
    Hae Jakhya!?
    Now you mention it, that is exactly like my name, ain't it?${prompt}
  8453: Yowl! But 'ow the 'ell could someone mix up a girrrly princess kitten like 'er with a rough and tough lioness like me! That's just not on!${prompt}
  8454: But, anyways, I'm glad that little matta is overrr! Quite relieved!${prompt}
  8455: So it was just anotherrr Mithra who has a similarrr name to our boss, Hae Jakkya, who borrowed the saucy romance novel... Well, that was a letdown!${prompt}
  8456: What a borrring outcome.${prompt}
  8457: 'The overdue book was called ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, was it? Hmm...${prompt}'
  8458: |-
    Oh...?
    Not that I'd have any rrreal interest in such a thing!${prompt}
  8459: Tehehe... I keep going out into East Sarutabaruta, hunt a whole lot of Mandragora, collect their four-leaf buds, then come back and sell them off here to make a killing-willing! I'm so richy-wichy now!♪${prompt}
  8460: 'Once I''ve saved up enough gil, I''m heading off to the shops on the docks of the port area. Any respectable black mage should at least equip herself with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, don''taru think?${prompt}'
  8461: |-
    The Cat Burglar-wurglar...?
    Oh, you mean Nanaa Mihgo!
    Of course I know her!${prompt}
  8462: She gets angry-wangry all of a sudden, so she can be kind of scary at times, but she knows a lot of interesting story-wories.${prompt}
  8463: Elvaan are all so high and haughty. It almost seems like they look down on us Tarutaru at times.${prompt}
  8464: |-
    Huh...?
    How dare you say that's because we are so short that everyone can't help but look down on us! Beat it before I bite your kneecaps!${prompt}
  8465: Magical energy is strong all around the vicinities of Windurst, so magical plants thrive here!${prompt}
  8466: The apothecary down the way combines her Mithran skills with the local flora to create all sorts of new medicinal products.${prompt}
  8467: Hmm...there's gotaru be some interesting stories floating around somewhere. Hey, you there, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/missy]...have you heard any juicy tidbits of information lately?${prompt}
  8468: I was expecting there to be a fuss among the Mithra over who assumes the chieftainness's throne, but nah... I guess good stories don'taru come that easy.${prompt}
  8469: We Mithra are often called the “people of the woods” because we originally lived in forrrests.${prompt}
  8470: Well, due to varrrious circumstances, we came to live in Windurst. This is a nice place, although I don't think we'll ever come to underrrstand the Tarutaru ways...but they aren't bad people at hearrrt.${prompt}
  8471: It is trrrue that the Mithra of Windurst obey the Star Sibyl...${prompt}
  8472: '...But that''s only because our chieftainness, Perih Vashai, is doing so herrrself.${prompt}'
  8473: Whenever you look around Windurst Woods you see Mithra, rrright? But just until a few decades ago, this whole arrrea was full of Tarutaru.${prompt}
  8474: That was until the warrr years when the Mithran chieftainness, Perih Vashai, came across the seas from the Mithran homeland with her arrrmy of fighters.${prompt}
  8475: Have you seen those automaton guarrrds called Cardians? They are made at the Manustery, herrre in Windurst Woods.${prompt}
  8476: The Manustery is famous for being the poorrrest of Windurst's five ministries of magic.${prompt}
  8477: Those automaton guards they call Cardians are said to grrrow smarter and smarter by the day as they learrrn more and more.${prompt}
  8478: It's only a matter of time until they all start developing their own perrrsonalities and then begin to fight among themselves. Won't that be fun?${prompt}

    How's it goin', mate?
    Enjoyin' a spot of adventurrrin', I see...${prompt}
  8480: Life's long, and you can put off till tommora what you don't wanta do today. So don't you be wearin' yourself out with all that adventurrrin', you hear?${prompt}
  8481: It's that very attitude that's stoppin' you from ever findin' the old pirate king's treasure, y'know-wow!?${prompt}
  8482: C'mon, we've gotta getta move on, Gottah! Hurry up and buy that armor you've been wantin' at the port-wort so we can go out and level up some more-wore!${prompt}
  8483: The firrrst rrrule of the Starrr Onion Brrrigade...!${prompt}
  8484: Show kindness to any stupid-looking adventurrrerrrs you meet!${prompt}
  8485: It's firrrst come, firrrst serrrved when it comes to the items put on auction. You'rrre competing in bidding against people frrrom all overrr the worrrld, so don't hesitate if you'rrre not surrre. Just do it!${prompt}

    I'm starrrving!
    I'm so hungrrry I could eat a...
    Hey...can you eat chocobos?
    I bet they taste like chicken!${prompt}
  8487: Perih Vashai is a Mithran heroine who rrrendered great service during the war twenty years ago.${prompt}
  8488: She lost a great many things back then, but never did she lose her pride or break her pledge. It just goes to show that physical strength is not the sole rrrequisite to be a hero.${prompt}
  8489: |-
    Our chieftainness is verrry old...
    It seems that she wants to pass the chieftainness's bow onto the Sibyl Guard Semih Lafihna.${prompt}
  8490: But I doubt if Semih Lafihna would accept that honorable responsibility. Quite a prrredicament we're in, eh?${prompt}
  8491: I don't think we've achieved any rrreal peace by making a pact with those Yagudo beastmen!${prompt}
  8492: But try explaining that to the Tarutaru, and they'll just be all stubborrrn and insist that it's the Star Sibyl's will!${prompt}
  8493: It's purrr-etty darn hard to catch a dhalmel, you know? Only we Mithra have the necessary abilities to do it propurrrly!${prompt}
  8494: To carry out that ability, you need something in purrrticular. To give you a hint, it's something that only Mithra have... Purrr...${prompt}
  8495: The centrrral hub of Windurst is the Windurst Walls distrrrict, with Heavens Tower encompassed by that overgrrrown star tree. You'll get there if you head north strrraight along this path.${prompt}
  8496: But it's too quiet there, with too many brrridges for my liking. I don't find it the least bit interrresting.${prompt}
  8497: You know about that mad hatter in the Tarutaru district of Windurst Waters, rrright?${prompt}
  8498: Well, those Tarutaru have nothing on us Mithra in Windurst Woods! Why, we have our own mad apothecary herrre!${prompt}
  8499: Hey... How come all the otherrr Mithrrra speak so badly of the Captain of the Sibyl Guarrrds from Heavens Towerrr? She is so strrrong and so cool-looking! Hey... Is she going to be ourrr next trrribal leaderrr?${prompt}
  8500: Windurst Woods is famous for its dhalmel farm up the rrroad there. You've just got to check it out!${prompt}
  8501: The cheese made from dhalmel's milk is an acquirrred taste, but once you come to appreciate it, you just can't stop eating the stuff!${prompt}
  8502: |-
    Where did I drop it?
    Damn, that's going to be impossible to find, too! What a catastrophe...!${prompt}
  8503: I heard that this was a land with strange animated dolls used as guards, but this surpassed all expectations.${prompt}
  8504: They say they make these magic dolls in a place called the Manustery. If I were to visit there, I wonder if they would permit me to go a round with one of those ungodly contraptions...${prompt}
  8505: |-
    Ha-ha...
    Now I get it!${prompt}
  8506: It's against the rules to ride a chocobo into the town. So that's why those strange automaton Cardian guard things chased me around and around like that!${prompt}
  8507: |-
    Phew-wee...
    I came all the way over here in search of hints for a new kind of business, but I can't believe my eyes!${prompt}
  8508: What in Vana'diel are those long-necked animals they have here? Are these also creations conjured up with Tarutaru magic?${prompt}

    Wee... We're now waltzing in Windurst Woods.

  8517: If you are after my daughterrr, then I suggest you head overrr to Windurst Waters. She's studying at the School of Magic there.${prompt}
  8518: From humble Mithran cold medicines to the legendary Windurstian ambrrrosia of immortality, we have it all...${prompt}

    Psst! Hey, you...

  8522: You're interested in some cheap shopping, rrright? I'm real sorry. I'm not doing business rrright now.${prompt}
  8523: Ladies and gentlemen, kittens and cubs! Do we have the sale that you've been waiting forrr!${prompt}
  8524: Sorry, but our shop is closed rrright now. Why don't you go to Gustaberg and help the situation out therrre?${prompt}

  8529: Yes. This is the consulate of San d'Oria. How may I be of service?${prompt}
  8530: I see... You have no business with me. Sorry, but I have work I must return to, so please allow me to continue with it. Good day.${prompt}
  8531: If I may, allow me to tell you a little about San d'Oria...${prompt}
  8532: San d'Oria is a land of the sword and of great faith. It is famous for its gallant Royal Knights and loyal Temple Knights, its grand regal chateau, and its glorious cathedral.${prompt}
  8533: The hymns sung in the cathedral are particularly divine. Even the stoniest of hearts cannot help but be moved by them.${prompt}
  8534: It is rather impossible to say that the Windurstian government is the most logical system. However, the Tarutaru believe in their Star Sibyl and maintain strong bonds with each other.${prompt}
  8535: And is it not the faith and the bonds of its citizens that make a country strong? Only when the hearts of the individuals are unified can a government really work.${prompt}
  8536: |-
    This is the consulate of San d'Oria.
    Our role is to serve and protect the citizens of San d'Oria residing in Windurst.${prompt}
  8537: But of course, we shan't forsake non-San d'Orian citizens who require our assistance. For we San d'Orians are indeed a just people.${prompt}
  8538: 'The light shines where there is righteousness, so do not be afraid, citizen of ${choice: 1}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst]. The soldiers of San d''Oria only unsheathe their swords in the name of justice.${prompt}'
  8539: The light shines only where there is righteousness. Fellow citizen of San d'Oria, never lose the pride you have in your country.${prompt}
  8540: |-
    Welcome to the consulate of San d'Oria.
    If you wish to speak to Consul Mourices, enter his office through the door on your right.${prompt}
  8541: So you've come all the way from San d'Oria, eh? Your dedication to serving the motherland is most admirable.${prompt}
  8542: Unfortunately, I am in one of my moods today. After I read the mission request from Windurst, I became most disgusted.${prompt}
  8543: Forine, please explain to the ${choice-player-gender}[brave man/nice lady] here what the mission entails.${prompt}
  8544: |-
    Yes, Consul.
    Allow me to explain...${prompt}
  8545: The mission from the Windurstian government entails the oblation of magic armor to Giddeus, the frontline to the abode of the Yagudo beastmen.${prompt}
  8546: A magic shield will be handed to you at Heavens Tower in Windurst Walls. Your orders are to deliver it to the Yagudo treasure chamber, deep in the underground of Giddeus.${prompt}
  8547: Have you had the misfortune of meeting the Yagudo yet? They have made a nasty practice out of ganging up to attack the travelers who pass through Sarutabaruta...${prompt}
  8548: These are the same beastmen who sided with “the Kindred” twenty years ago, and killed many of our comrades in the war.${prompt}
  8549: However, the Windurstians have grown too complacent and show their love of pacifism--even if it is nothing more than a one-sided façade--by forming amicable relations with the Yagudo beastmen.${prompt}
  8550: And now they dare ask us proud San d'Orians to carry a tribute to a pack of beastmen. It would almost be laughable if it wasn't such a slap in the face.${prompt}
  8551: However, this mission has to be accomplished as part of our pledge to Windurst. We Elvaan are not ones to break our promises, are we?${prompt}
  8552: And yet, at the same time, as San d'Orians, we cannot allow this injustice to go unchecked.${prompt}
  8553: The situation is most exasperating. However, I must command you to go and give the Yagudo their magic shield. But at the same time, I entreat you to deprive the other Yagudo you meet along the way of two of their shields, making up for the imbalance.${prompt}
  8554: Now, off with you!${prompt}
  8555: However exasperating the situation, I must command you to go give the Yagudo their magic shield. At the same time, I entreat you to deprive the Yagudo you meet along the way twice the number of the shields to make up for the imbalance.${prompt}
  8556: No Elvaan would ever do something as dishonorable as breaking a promise to another.${prompt}
  8557: Your orders are to proceed to Heavens Tower in Windurst Walls, where a magic shield will be handed to you.${prompt}
  8558: In order to accomplish this mission as assigned by Windurst, you are to deliver the shield to the Yagudo treasure chamber, deep underground in Giddeus. However, that is not all...${prompt}
  8559: While we cannot break our promise to the Windurstians, to ensure justice is served, we would secretly like you to take two shields off of the Yagudo who you meet en route.${prompt}
  8560: Act according to our convictions while fulfilling our promise with the Tarutaru. This is indeed a fitting course for us, the people of glorious San d'Oria.${prompt}
  8561: |-
    Fool!
    Did you not hear our orders correctly? Or are you just out to start a war?${prompt}
  8562: Can you not remember the most important part of the mission? You had to deliver a magic shield to the Yagudo treasure chamber. And you call yourself a San d'Orian!?${prompt}
  8563: Fool!${prompt}
  8564: You only handed over Windurst's magic shield to the Yagudo and skipped back, leaving the balance of power skewed. Such action would be considered treason back in San d'Oria!!!${prompt}
  8565: Humph. Seems as if you were able to maintain the path of righteousness.${prompt}
  8566: You are now to head to the Consulate of San d'Oria in Bastok.${prompt}
  8567: Do you know the way to Bastok from here? You can travel by sea from Mhaura back to Selbina. From there, you have to cross the highlands to the south.${prompt}
  8568: |-
    Glory to the Kingdom of San d'Oria.
    Farewell and safe passage.${prompt}
  8569: Head to the Consulate of San d'Oria in Bastok.${prompt}
  8570: The best way to journey to Bastok from here is to ride a ship from Mhaura back to Selbina. From there, you have to cross the highlands to the south.${prompt}
  8571: The Republic of Bastok is occupied by two races, the Hume and the Galka, who are the exact antithesis of each other.${prompt}
  8572: Occasionally they break out into fights, so it is imperative that you maintain neutrality as you assess the situation and then avail yourself to the righteous ones.${prompt}
  8573: Now that you have completed that little mission of amity, you are just an ordinary San d'Orian citizen again. So that frees you to go to Giddeus and really give those beastmen what they deserve.${prompt}
  8574: However, we shan't take responsibility if you get seriously hurt in the process.${prompt}
  8575: Your efforts are well noted. Take care on your journey to Bastok.${prompt}
  8576: So you've come all the way from San d'Oria, eh? Your dedication to serving the motherland is most admirable.${prompt}
  8577: This mission on the behalf of the Windurstian government displays our country's level of friendship towards Windurst.${prompt}
  8578: Forine, please explain to the ${choice-player-gender}[brave man/nice lady] here what the mission entails.${prompt}
  8579: |-
    Yes, Consul.
    Allow me to explain Windurst's request...${prompt}
  8580: A giant monster has appeared in the depths of Giddeus, the borderland to the theocracy of the Yagudo beastmen. The Windurstian government wants it exterminated.${prompt}
  8581: You are to receive a key from Heavens Tower in the Windurst Walls district and head to the innermost part of Giddeus, where the creature awaits.${prompt}
  8582: Ha-ha! What a jolly tale that is. A ferocious monster appearing in the heart of Giddeus, scaring the Yagudo so much they ask Tarutaru to help them?${prompt}
  8583: It's most fortunate for those beastmen that the Windurst government had sought amicable relations with them in order to maintain the peace of their country.${prompt}
  8584: What? Don't tell me you hadn't heard of Windurst's little peace pact with the Yagudo?${prompt}
  8585: Of course, we San d'Orians have no need to show to those vulgar beastmen any courtesy whatsoever, but this is an agreement between our two countries, so we have no choice but to go through with it.${prompt}
  8586: So go ahead and exterminate the ferocious monster plaguing the depths of Giddeus, but don't think you have to hold back from also giving those whining beastmen what they deserve.${prompt}
  8587: |-
    Anyway, enough chatter.
    Godspeed on your assignment.${prompt}
  8588: Go and exterminate the ferocious monster plaguing the depths of Giddeus, but don't hold back from also giving those whining beastmen what they deserve.${prompt}
  8589: To access the innermost part of Giddeus, you must receive the key from Heavens Tower in the Windurst Walls district.${prompt}
  8590: Report back here once you have defeated the ferocious monster that is menacing the Yagudo in the depths of Giddeus.${prompt}
  8591: I would not try to deny the Tarutaru of this land from pursuing peace. It is just that I desire lasting peace, not the temporary façade that Windurst has now.${prompt}
  8592: The apparent tranquility of this place can be considered an illusion born from idealism. Until we wake Windurst from its dream it will continue to be beyond help.${prompt}
  8593: Becoming a soldier is a completely different way of life than being a mere fighter.${prompt}
  8594: You are caught between intricate orders and chivalry, and sometimes you have to go against your personal convictions...${prompt}
  8595: What is this you speak? The Shadow Lord is being resurrected!?${prompt}
  8596: |-
    This cannot be!
    We'll have to report this to the royal family!${prompt}
  8597: I shall write an epistle. I will need you to deliver it posthaste to Monarlais Halver back in the motherland.${prompt}
  8598: You must protect this letter with your life. Now hurry and deliver it to San d'Oria!${prompt}
  8599: What are you dawdling for, ${choice-player-gender}[boy/girl]? Did I not order you to hurry back to San d'Oria and pass my letter on to Halver, the Monarlais?${prompt}
  8600: Consul Mourices's face has blanched. Did you say something to upset him? Did you not complete your mission correctly?${prompt}
  8601: The ferocious monster was really a trap set by the beastmen...? What a horrid turn of events this has proved to be.${prompt}
  8602: |-
    Moreover, there is talk of a nether beast appearing?
    Could it be...? No! Do not tell me that we are marching forthright into another Great War?${prompt}
  8603: You mentioned that when the nether beast appeared, a Mithra guard came to your aid?${prompt}
  8604: The only Mithra with that degree of strength would be one of the Sibyl Guards from Heavens Tower.${prompt}

    Welcome to the auction house.
    Do you have any questions about our establishment?${prompt}
  8701: |-
    What do you want to know?
    ${selection-lines}
    What is the auction house?
    How are auctions run?
    Are there any fees?
    Are there any limits?
    How do you check up on merchandise?
    How do you remove an item?
    My “Sales Status” list is full!
    Nothing right now.${prompt}
  8702: Auction houses can be found in all of Vana'diel's major cities. Here adventurers gather to bid on battle spoils, unwanted items, old armor...almost anything.${prompt}
  8703: Currently, the auction houses in Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno all work independently. Therefore, prices differ from city to city.${prompt}
  8704: Adventurers may use any auction house regardless of nationality.${prompt}
  8705: The first adventurer to bid at or above the asking price will automatically purchase the product.${prompt}
  8706: Once put up for auction, merchandise will remain there for a maximum of thirty weeks Vana'diel time (nine-and-a-half days Earth time).${prompt}
  8707: If merchandise does not sell within this time limit, it will be returned to the seller's current residence.${prompt}
  8708: Transaction fees are proportional to the amount for which an item is put up on auction. The method of calculating this fee is different for single items and stackable items.${prompt}
  8709: A transaction fee is collected when any merchandise is put up for auction. This fee is nonrefundable.${prompt}
  8710: The International Auction House Committee, or IAHC, has declared that a maximum of seven items may be put up for auction at one time.${prompt}
  8711: However, the IAHC has recently removed the limit to how many items one may purchase.${prompt}
  8712: A small amount of time is required before new merchandise appears on our bid list.${prompt}
  8713: Once an item appears on your “Sales Status” list, it may not immediately appear on the bid list. If you do not see your item on the bid list, try looking again at a later time.${prompt}
  8714: If you would like to withdraw an item from an auction, you must travel to the auction house, and select “Stop Sale” from the “Sales Status” menu.${prompt}
  8715: To remove an item from your “Sales Status” list, you must visit an auction counter to acknowledge the sale or return of your merchandise.${prompt}
  8716: Otherwise, previously sold or returned items will fill up your list and prevent you from selling any more merchandise.${prompt}
  8717: At any auction counter, open the “Sales Status” menu and acknowledge the transaction to clear it from the list.${prompt}
  8718: Press the confirm button to remove any transaction colored yellow (sold) or red (returned).${prompt}
  8719: Is there anything else you would like to know?${prompt}
  8720: In the past, many have amassed great wealth through the auction house. I hope you find fortune, too!${prompt}

  8754: Here's your present--a shiny new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 60 items, kupo!${prompt}
  8755: |-
    Looking at that shabby old bed makes me feel homesick, kupo.
    Will my benevolent master give ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?${prompt}
  8756: |-
    Master, Master!
    I have a favor to ask, kupo!${prompt}
  8757: |-
    Sleeping on that ${item-singular: 3[2]} has made me homesick, kupo.
    Will my benevolent master give ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?${prompt}
  8758: "Give your moogle a vacation？\n${selection-lines}\nSure, kupo! \nNo, your time is mine!${prompt}"
  8759: |-
    Thank you, kupo!
    I have one more favor to ask... I want to take my family on a picnic, kupo!${prompt}
  8760: 'Papa Moogle is mad for fishing, so I want to give him ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, kupo!${prompt}'
  8761: 'Mama Moogle would bake a scrumptious mooglepie to take with us, but she''d need ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, kupo!${prompt}'
  8762: |-
    But...I haven't the foggiest idea of how to get either of these things, kupo...
    Whatever am I to do, kupo?${prompt}
  8763: 'Papa Mog is mad for fishing, so I want to give him ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, kupo!${prompt}'
  8764: 'Mama Moogle would bake a scrumptious mooglepie to take with us, but she''d need ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, kupo!${prompt}'
  8765: |-
    But...I haven't the foggiest idea of how to get either of these things, kupo...
    Whatever am I to do, kupo?${prompt}
  8766: |-
    Master!
    I'm overwhelmed by your kindness, kupo!!!${prompt}
  8767: |-
    I'll bring you a nice present from the moogles' hometown, kupo!
    I'll be back in a few days, kupo!${prompt}
  8768: |-
    Master!
    I'm back from my vacation, kupo!${prompt}
  8769: Here's your present--the behemoth of Mog Safes, kupo! Now you can store as many as 70 items, kupo!${prompt}
  8770: The capacity of your Mog Safe has increased!${prompt}
  8771: |-
    Master, Master!
    I have a favor to ask, kupo!${prompt}
  8772: 'After resting on the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, I noticed a letter had arrived from some old moogle friends, kupo! Will my magnanimous master give me some time off to go visit my old buddies?${prompt}'
  8773: |-
    Give your moogle some time off?
    ${selection-lines}
    Have fun, kupo!
    No, I am your only friend now!${prompt}
  8774: |-
    Oh, thank you, master!
    My moogle friends live across the seas, so I have another favor to ask you, kupo!${prompt}
  8775: 'The sun beats down mercilessly in the land beyond the west sea, so I need to take ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]} for my friends there, kupo!${prompt}'
  8776: 'And my other buddies need ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} for the torrential rains that scour the lands across the east sea, kupo!${prompt}'
  8777: 'I can''t help out my friends if I don''t have ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, kupo...${prompt}'

  8779: |-
    Master!
    I'm back from visiting my old moogle friends, kupo!${prompt}
  8780: We all got together and made you a new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 80 items, kupo!${prompt}
  8781: |-
    I was looking for you.
    It seems like you've been prrracticing to become a master thief.${prompt}
  8782: Usually I don't mingle with my competition, but the Tenshodo has put out a call for able-bodied thieves.${prompt}
  8783: The Tenshodo came to us, so don't even think of turning down their offer.${prompt}
  8784: |-
    Well, I'll see you in Jeuno!
    As those little wizards say, ta-taru!${prompt}
  8785: I'll see you at the Tenshodo headquarters in Jeuno.${prompt}
  8786: The Tenshodo is one of the biggest dealers of merchandise in all of Vana'diel. An adventurer like you has surely heard of it.${prompt}
  8787: Ahh, Jeuno... How long has it been since I last got my paws into the pockets of those bigwigs?${prompt}
  8788: You say you've already met up with the rrremains of Atarefaunet's band? Did they tell you anything?${prompt}
  8789: The guy I talked to was acting like he was so much better than us. He sure rrrubbed my fur the wrrrong way.${prompt}
  8790: You don't hearrr the name Atarefaunet around these parts that often. I heard that he was pretty famous in the west, though.${prompt}
  8791: At the time, Atarefaunet's band was loaded with the best of the best. They say that some of the memberrrs were even professional killers, so you had better watch your back.${prompt}
  8792: <Sigh> The top cat can surrre be difficult at times...${prompt}
  8793: The weapon you got... What's it like?${prompt}
  8794: Getting such a fine weapon for such a cakewalk job... It's almost like stealing!${prompt}
  8795: |-
    Ah, I've been looking for you.
    You know how we got those papers from the Tenshodo and delivered them individually?${prompt}
  8796: Did you check the signature you got from the Atarefaunet member before giving the papers to Vauderame?${prompt}
  8797: 'You know, the last signature on the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}? It was a single letter. Did you see it?${prompt}'
  8798: |-
    Did you see the signature?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  8799: |-
    Are you rrreally a thief?
    Un-be-liev-able!!${prompt}
  8800: |-
    Let me tell you, then.
    The signature you got was a “V.”${prompt}
  8801: "How do I know, you ask? \nI can tell what's written on a piece of paper just by touching it.${prompt}"
  8802: |-
    Ah! That's my little thief!
    ...So, what was the letter?${prompt}
  8803: |-
    What was the signature?
    ${selection-lines}
    T
    A
    V
    I...forget.${prompt}
  8804: |-
    Rrright.
    The signature you got was a “V.”${prompt}
  8805: But the prrroblem is, the initial you got doesn't match the initial of the member's name, rrright?${prompt}
  8806: The signature that I got didn't match either.${prompt}
  8807: This didn't happen to only you and me. I also asked Esca of San d'Oria and Nbu Latteh of Bastok, and it was the same with them.${prompt}
  8808: Doesn't all this seem just a little bit fishy? Doesn't it get your whiskers twitching?${prompt}
  8809: After that task, I did some digging on Atarefaunet's band. It seems that the treasure from the last big heist they pulled off has yet to be found.${prompt}
  8810: The way I see it, those signatures were some sort of code. To contact the rrremaining members of Atarefaunet's band after all this time just doesn't make sense otherwise.${prompt}
  8811: Vauderame of the Tenshodo is searching for that treasure. So he threatens Atarefaunet's cutthroats, and collects the code letters...${prompt}
  8812: I'm gonna collect the signatures from the other six members. Will you help me?${prompt}
  8813: |-
    Help out?
    ${selection-lines}
    Where do I sign?
    I'll keep my paws out of this one...${prompt}
  8814: Scaredy-cat! You'll never become a world-famous thief at this rate...${prompt}
  8815: Are you up for it?${prompt}
  8816: |-
    Okay, take these.
    I made copies of the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} you rrreceived before. Use them in the same way to get signatures from those brrrigands.${prompt}
  8817: |-
    Huh? What should you say?
    I'm sure you'll think of something...${prompt}
  8818: The last obstacle is finding the members' hideouts... At the moment, we know the location of two of the bandits, so why don't you go pay them a visit?${prompt}
  8819: We tailed them to their hideouts. Herrre, I wrote the locations down for you.${prompt}
  8820: If the top cat says something is fishy, you better believe it!${prompt}
  8821: First things first! Get ahold of those signatures. Oh, and by the way, don't even think of drrropping this little errand halfway through...${prompt}
  8822: 'The location of the hideouts are wrrritten on the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, right?${prompt}'
  8823: Find the hideouts, and get those signatures. Go on, shoo!${prompt}
  8824: From what I saw, to meet with the member in the Goblin store in Jeuno, you have to try your hand at a game of chance.${prompt}
  8825: Esca was furrrious at being forced to play over and over just because of her bad luck. Are you feeling lucky?${prompt}
  8826: |-
    Just a minute!
    I completely forgot. To climb the towerrr in Sauromugue Champaign, you need to have ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}
  8827: But even if you have one, you won't be getting up that tower if you're a fat cat!${prompt}
  8828: Did you get those signatures? I have the last two rrright here.${prompt}
  8829: |-
    Okay, eight letters... Let's put them together...
    V, Z, A, N, A, T, A, I...${prompt}　
  8830: Hmm... If I put this here... Umm...${prompt}
  8831: |-
    Huh? You still here?
    Here, take your loot and scoot. I'll let you know when I figure this out. Come and see me later.${prompt}
  8832: |-
    Huh? You still here?
    Here, take your loot and scoot. I'll let you know when I figure this out. Come and see me later.${prompt}
  8833: |-
    We had our troubles, too.
    The member I went after told me, “Thieves need to be fleet on their feet.” I had to chase that villain around for hourrrs.${prompt}
  8834: |-
    Ow, I hurt...
    What use is beauty in thieving?
    My m-muscles are so sore!${prompt}
  8835: I finally figured out the code. All those letters we got from the Atarefaunet band...I know what they mean.${prompt}
  8836: When I rrrearranged the order of the letters, I came out with “Tavnazia.”${prompt}
  8837: |-
    Tavnazia...
    In other words, the Tavnazian Marquisate. A nation to the west that was obliterated by the beastmen in the Great War.${prompt}
  8838: Tavnazia pledged allegiance to San d'Oria and was ruled by Marquis Altedour. But after some investigation, I discovered some slightly more interesting facts.${prompt}
  8839: Just before the nation was swarmed under by the beastmen, the knights of Tavnazia carried away the rrroyal treasure. However, the knights themselves were attacked by brigands and the treasure was stolen.${prompt}
  8840: If you listen to the old thieves, they'll tell you it was the work of the Atarefaunet band. But since the leader of the band died, the truth is anybody's guess.${prompt}
  8841: |-
    Isn't this exciting?
    The rrremaining members of the Atarefaunet band must hold the key to the location of the Tavnazian royal treasure!${prompt}
  8842: Vauderame of the Tenshodo must be arranging a deal with them to get his greedy hands on the goods.${prompt}
  8843: Now that I know his plans, I'll have to work my way into his circle and get my paws in the pie, too.${prompt}
  8844: Don't rrrush into anything just yet. There's something wrong. Vauderame hasn't made a move yet.${prompt}
  8845: If he had made some sort of deal with the brigands, you would think they would get together somewhere first, then head off to get the treasure.${prompt}
  8846: Vauderame is a man of many secrets.${prompt}
  8847: Nobody really knows his background, and he loses us every time we try to tail him. There's something dangerous about that man.${prompt}
  8848: |-
    ...Hmm.
    A very mysterious character, indeed. Speaking of mysteries, there's one thing that I don't quite understand.${prompt}
  8849: Why did the brigands send the word “Tavnazia” to Vauderame?${prompt}
  8850: Surely he would have already known about the Tavnazian royal treasure before planning to meet with them.${prompt}
  8851: '...That''s it!${prompt}'
  8852: |-
    ${name-player},
    I want you to go and ask these two thieves a question.${prompt}
  8853: The person who wrote the papers from the Tenshodo, the name at the top...what was wrrritten there?${prompt}
  8854: Quickly now! There's no time!${prompt}
  8855: We'll deal with the rest, so hurry! Be on your way!${prompt}
  8856: A nation with allegiance to San d'Oria, ruled by Marquis Altedour... It's supposed to lie farrr to the west of here...${prompt}
  8857: Anyway, let's put the geography lesson aside and go pull the rrrug out from under the Tenshodo! Things have started to get interesting...${prompt}
  8858: Vauderame is a very mysterrrious character. He's been in the Tenshodo for ten years, quietly building up his current standing.${prompt}
  8859: I get the sense that he's made a deliberrrate effort to rrreach a position that allows him to move freely while keeping a low profile.${prompt}
  8860: |-
    Did you get the information I asked for?
    Okay, let's put it all together and see what we have.${prompt}
  8861: You've probably already noticed, but the name of the person who wrrrote the papers is different on each one. However, the contents are all exactly the same. A little odd, don't you think?${prompt}
  8862: This must have some other meaning. If we lay out the letters that we both discovered, we have... D, L, E, L, O, R, E.${prompt}
  8863: '...What was the letter you had for the papers you delivered originally?${prompt}'
  8864: |-
    What was the signature?
    ${selection-lines}
    M
    Q
    Blank
    I forget${prompt}
  8865: Exactly. Your papers had a blank area where the signature should have been. So, rrrearranging the seven letters, we get...${prompt}
  8866: If you keep playing the fool, I may have to bite you. Your papers had a blank area where the signature should have been. So, rrrearranging the seven letters, we get...${prompt}
  8867: “Ordelle”!${prompt}
  8868: We must hurry to Ordelle's Caves!${prompt}
  8869: Vauderame used us to tell the bandits to gather at Ordelle's Caves.${prompt}
  8870: We must hurry to Ordelle's Caves!${prompt}
  8871: Vauderame used us to tell the bandits to gather at Ordelle's Caves.${prompt}
  8872: |-
    What's all the fuss about?
    You've brrroken the code!? Terrrific!${prompt}
  8873: Atarefaunet's band is rumored to contain prrrofessional killers, so keep on your toes and keep out of sight. They're a dangerrrous bunch.${prompt}
  8874: It's great that we found the treasure... But I get the feeling there's something important I'm forgetting... What could it be...? Grrr, that's rrreally gonna annoy me...${prompt}
  8875: Thanks for looking after the top cat. If something happened to her, we'd just go back to being a couple of strrrays.${prompt}
  8876: When I checked at the Tenshodo, Vauderame was nowhere to be found. It's like he just popped out of existence...${prompt}
  8877: So you have come, my fellow ranger. I thank the winds for your safe return.${prompt}
  8878: "I have a task for you. \nIt is said that adventurers follow the winds, traveling far and wide across Vana'diel.${prompt}"
  8879: I wish for you to meet with Sibyl Guard Semih Lafihna with all haste. Give her this. She should rrreturn here with you.${prompt}
  8880: Currently, Semih Lafihna is conducting an investigation in a place called Ranguemont Pass, located on the western continent.${prompt}
  8881: |-
    There is little time.
    ...The blessing of the winds go with you.${prompt}
  8882: Find Semih Lafihna and give her the earring. She should rrreturn here with you.${prompt}
  8883: Currently, Semih Lafihna is conducting an investigation in a place called Ranguemont Pass, located on the western continent. May the winds protect and guide you, adventurer.${prompt}
  8884: A Mithran Tracker from the homeland has arrived.${prompt}
  8885: |-
    It's been decades since...
    The sin will not be forgiven. Even if what happened was destiny...${prompt}
  8886: For Mithra, there are three laws that are inviolate.${prompt}
  8887: The Mithran Tracker is the one who brings judgment for those sins. The family who perpetrated the sin is extinguished from the land, from the sky, from time itself.${prompt}
  8888: I see you were able to find Semih Lafihna...${prompt}
  8889: |-
    ...Just a moment...
    That prrresence...${prompt}
  8890: Chieftainness Perih Vashai, I apologize for this interruption.${prompt}
  8891: '...You are the Mithran Tracker, I prrresume?${prompt}'
  8892: If your visit concerns the sinner's daughter, we are prrresently focusing all our efforts on finding the one who can confirm her passing.${prompt}
  8893: Attempt to rrreturn the past to dust if you will, but it will avail you naught. Dust is swept up by the wind, its scent carried on. The scent of my quarry.${prompt}
  8894: |-
    I will tell you once morrre.
    I have no rrreason to hide the past. The bearer of the bow does not oppose the trrruth.${prompt}
  8895: Be that as it may, the loss of the Bow of Light does not sit well with me.${prompt}
  8896: |-
    I will speak bluntly.
    Perih Vashai, I believe you strrruck some kind of deal with the sinner.${prompt}
  8897: Your daughter's age was close to that of the sinner's. Is it possible you sympathized with their plight?${prompt}
  8898: '......${prompt}'
  8899: As I'm sure you are well aware, I won't be leaving this land until I have hunted down the sinner. I will enlighten the people of the Outlands on the evils of hiding sin.${prompt}
  8900: Chieftainness Perih Vashai!${prompt}
  8901: |-
    The Mithra I just saw...
    She was the Mithran Tracker from the homeland, wasn't she?${prompt}
  8902: |-
    Yes, but do not seek to hinder her.
    She is here to see justice done, and serves nature as we do.${prompt}
  8903: |-
    I want you to give me a clear answer.
    I come as a keeper of the peace of Windurst. Is the daughter of the sinner really dead?${prompt}
  8904: |-
    Do you doubt it...?
    I see, you were questioned by the Tracker.${prompt}
  8905: Yes, she followed me to Jugner Forest. It seems the sinner carries a scent that we cannot detect.${prompt}
  8906: 'But I was not the daughter the Tracker was seeking. Did you send the earring out of concern for me? If so, your fears appear to be unfounded.${prompt} '
  8907: '......${prompt}'
  8908: I will take this opportunity to tell you, even if you are found to be guilty, I have no intention of becoming the next Chieftainness of Windurst.${prompt}
  8909: However, I also have little desirrre to aid that Mithran Tracker in her hunt. I have no interest in the mysterrries of the past. The future is all that concerns me now.${prompt}
  8910: |-
    ${name-player}.
    You see us in troubled times. On occasion, even the Mithra fight amongst themselves.${prompt}
  8911: I feel that your talents will become necessary before this struggle comes to an end. Will you promise to lend us your strrrength in our time of need?${prompt}
  8912: Take this as a symbol of your pledge. May the path cleared by the wind always lie before you.${prompt}
  8913: |-
    ${name-player}.
    You see us in troubled times. On occasion, even the Mithra fight amongst themselves.${prompt}
  8914: I feel that your talents will become necessary before this struggle comes to an end. Will you promise to lend us your strrrength in our time of need?${prompt}
  8915: The Mithran Tracker has come from the homeland of our people.${prompt}
  8916: There was another time, twenty years ago, when a Mithran Tracker arrived from across the seas. However, that was not the same Mithra that was here a moment ago.${prompt}
  8917: For Mithra, there are three laws that are inviolate.${prompt}
  8918: No matter how far we roam from the homeland, we cannot escape these laws. For those who break the laws of nature, only oblivion awaits.${prompt}
  8919: 'Good luck, ${choice: 0}[citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation''s Signet.${wait-animation: 0}${prompt}'
  8920: I cannot help you. You should go find a guard from your own country.${prompt}
  8921: |-
    I cannot accept crystals from someone whose rank is still 1.
    I advise you to either keep them until your reach rank 2, or to use them in craftwork.${prompt}

  8923: 'Since we are allied with Bastok...${wait-animation: 0}${prompt}'
  8924: 'Since we are allied with Windurst...${wait-animation: 0}${prompt}'
  8925: |-
    I am sorry.
    I am too busy with other matters to be speaking with you.${wait-animation: 0}${prompt}
  8926: Ah, you have brought us supplies. These will help us indeed. I thank you.${prompt}
  8927: |-
    Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly.
    I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.${prompt}
  8928: You've earned conquest points!${prompt}
  8929: |-
    You've received your nation's Signet.
    You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!${prompt}
  8930: |-
    I am ${name-npc}, a Temple Knight.
    I am one of the guards charged with overseeing San d'Oria's conquest campaign.${prompt}
  8931: |-
    I am ${name-npc}, an Iron Musketeer.
    I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Bastok's conquest campaign.${prompt}

    I am ${name-npc}, a War Warlock.
    I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Windurst's conquest campaign.${prompt}

    What is your business?
    ${selection-lines}
    Would you cast Signet on me?
    I want to spend my conquest points.
    ${choice: 0}[I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.]
    I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F.
    I want to go on a supplies quest.
    I have some questions...
    Nothing, sorry to bother you.${prompt}
  8934: |-
    What do you wish to know about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Nothing.
    Conquests.
    Conquest results.
    Donating crystals.
    Conquest points.
    The effects of controlling regions.
    Regions controlled by other nations.
    Regions under beastman control.${prompt}
  8935: All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt}
  8936: Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt}
  8937: Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt}
  8938: So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt}
  8939: |-
    Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.
    They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt}
  8940: Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt}
  8941: Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt}
  8942: |-
    So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.
    We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt}
  8943: |-
    You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.
    Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt}
  8944: |-
    Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.
    The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt}
  8945: |-
    You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  8946: |-
    We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  8947: |-
    You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.
    Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt}

  8951: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt}
  8952: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt}
  8953: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt}

  8957: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt}
  8958: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt}

    Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.

  8961: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt}
  8962: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt}
  8963: There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt}

  9261: Have the winds sent you to me once more...?${prompt}
  9262: I have just had word that one who knows of the fate of the sinner's daughter can be found in the Blacksmiths' Guild of Mhaura.${prompt}
  9263: Upon hearing this, the Mithran Tracker immediately set off on her way. I wish for you to also travel to Mhaura and meet with this perrrson.${prompt}
  9264: |-
    You have your task.
    The blessing of the winds upon you.${prompt}
  9265: I have learned that one who knows of the fate of the sinner's daughter can be found in the Blacksmiths' Guild of Mhaura.${prompt}
  9266: Upon hearing this, the Mithran Tracker immediately set off on her way. I wish for you to also travel to Mhaura and meet with this perrrson.${prompt}
  9267: Twenty years prrrevious, there was a sinner who escaped from her prrrison and fled to this continent.${prompt}
  9268: There are few Mithra in Windurst who know of her tale. It is a low point in our historrry, and not a thing that is often spoke of...${prompt}
  9269: There is little point in asking those of us who rrremember. We do not talk about it willingly.${prompt}
  9270: We are of the trrribe to the south. The events that trrranspired among us at that time are taboo. That is all I can tell you.${prompt}
  9271: |-
    You have rrreturned.
    ...And the Mithran Tracker with you.${prompt}
  9272: After learning the location of the daughter's final rrresting place, we trrraveled to a place known as the Eldieme Necropolis.${prompt}
  9273: 'There, we found ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Piecing togetherrr everything I have heard, I believe it must belong to the sinner''s daughter.${prompt}'
  9274: |-
    However, one problem rrremains.
    Where is the other half of the stone?
    Where is the grrrave of the mother?${prompt}
  9275: We were unable to discover the mother's body.${prompt}
  9276: Since she was held captive in the prison of Castle Oztroja, her rrremains should lie there still.${prompt}
  9277: It is said that the King of Oztroja forces prrrisoners to fight his Yagudo in a hall on the highest level of the castle. The bodies of the fallen are then supposedly thrrrown into a large pond.${prompt}
  9278: If you search the pond thorrroughly, you may find what you are looking for...${prompt}
  9279: 'Well, I will leave this task to you. Rrreturn here as soon as you find the ${item-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  9280: |-
    I must apologize, adventurer.
    I would like to send a parrrty of warriors to aid you, but we do not have permission from Heavens Tower to enter Castle Oztroja.${prompt}
  9281: The blessing of the earth upon you.${prompt}
  9282: In the time of the Great War, the warriors held in Oztroja were forced to fight with Yagudo in a hall on the castle's highest floor.${prompt}
  9283: The fallen warriors were then thrrrown into a large pond on the upper levels.${prompt}
  9284: 'I believe the ${item-singular: 2[2]} that fits with the ${item-singular: 1[2]} of Syu Befrathi can be found there... However, the talents of a ranger will be needed to discover it.${prompt}'
  9285: |-
    You found it...
    Yes, it's a perrrfect match with Syu Befrathi's ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
  9286: |-
    I'm impressed.
    Tales of mighty adventurers are often little more than exaggerated rumor.${prompt}
  9287: However, while this adventurer was perrrforming ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] task, I was busy talking with an important witness.${prompt}
  9288: This witness claims that the use of a shining bow was rrresponsible for your loss of sight.${prompt}
  9289: The witness also mentioned that the prisoners of Oztroja were saved by a bow that loosed arrows of light so dazzling, the Yagudo were struck blind. This could only describe the Bow of Light.${prompt}
  9290: It is time for the truth to be known. You are concealing the Bow of Light, aren't you? Have you been seduced by its powerrr, Perih Vashai?${prompt}
  9291: Even for one who is blind, surely you can see this has gone on long enough!${prompt}
  9292: '......${prompt}'
  9293: |-
    Very well.
    It is said that you are not one to run and hide.${prompt}
  9294: I am in no hurry. Let us leave it at this for now.${prompt}
  9295: And this, adventurer, I give to you. May you always be on the side of justice.${prompt}
  9296: |-
    ...The Bow of Light.
    Thirty years have passed since its creation. And all it has brought us is death and misfortune.${prompt}
  9297: This all started when we came to this continent. The elders called this place the Forbidden Land, and were opposed to the crossing. It all started here...${prompt}
  9298: We Mithra receive the blessing of the earth in creating the chieftainness's bow.${prompt}
  9299: Chieftainness Perih Vashai received the blessing of this land when she made the Azure Bow.${prompt}
  9300: The Bow of Light belongs to the Fire Tribe of the south. The arrows fired from that bow are said to be so powerrrful and so destrrructive, no enemy can stand before them.${prompt}
  9301: But no matter how powerrrful a weapon is, our chieftainness would not take up that bow. Its use would contrrradict the code of the ranger.${prompt}
  9302: |-
    ...?
    The one who follows you here...${prompt}
  9303: |-
    Perih Vashai.
    There is something I wish to ask you. Please give me an answer.${prompt}
  9304: '...And what might that be, Semih Lafihna? You wish to ask me about the lost Bow of Light?${prompt}'
  9305: No, not that. It's about my past...${prompt}
  9306: I rrrealized something with all this talk of the Bow of Light. The Sibyl Guards, every one of us, were prisoners in Oztroja twenty years ago.${prompt}
  9307: I listened to everyone's stories, and they all have memories of being saved by that bow. But for some reason, I have no recollection of it...${prompt}
  9308: I was one of those prisoners as well, wasn't I? I was taken in by Heavens Tower to keep the secrets of the Bow of Light hidden from the world.${prompt}
  9309: Or was there some other reason that only affected me? I don't know how you managed to erase the scent of sin from me, but I must be the sinner's...${prompt}
  9310: Semih Lafihna, I swear on the Azure Bow. You are not the sinner's daughter.${prompt}
  9311: |-
    Then why?
    The Mithran Tracker assured me there was no record of my parents. And there's one thing I dimly rrrecall...${prompt}
  9312: 'At the time of the Great War, I rrremember my ${item-singular: 1[2]} was switched with another. My past...why...?${prompt}'
  9313: Why doesn't anybody know about my past?${prompt}
  9314: I meant to tell you after all this was over, but I see I have no choice.${prompt}
  9315: Go to Mhaura and meet with Koh Lenbalalako.${prompt}
  9316: 'If you take the ${item-singular: 1[2]} I entrrrusted to this adventurer, she will talk with you.${prompt}'
  9317: Once Semih Lafihna meets with Koh Lenbalalako of Mhaura, she will understand.${prompt}
  9318: I would like you to follow her to Mhaura. She will need your strrrength to help bring an end to this tale.${prompt}
  9319: The chieftainness wishes Semih Lafihna to see the trrruth with her own eyes.${prompt}
  9320: Everything becomes clear when you choose to see of your own free will. “Will” represents the eye of the spirit. As a ranger, the vision of your spirit must not become clouded...${prompt}
  9321: The Mithran Tracker is unwavering in her search for the Bow of Light.${prompt}
  9322: But, no matter how she tries to sway us, we will not betrrray our chieftainness. We have sworn to obey the chieftainness in all things.${prompt}
  9323: So, you will follow Semih and trrravel to the Northland?${prompt}
  9324: The Northlands are a place of death that we Mithra avoid above all others. It is a land that rrrobs us of the blessing and grace of nature. May the winds watch over you.${prompt}
  9325: I now have the Bow of Light in my possession. The magicite that gave this bow its cursed power has been rrreturned to the land where it belongs.${prompt}
  9326: I wish to express my heartfelt grrratitude to you, Semih Lafihna, for rrretrieving it from the wilds of the Northlands.${prompt}
  9327: It was not I who found the bow. That honor belongs to the adventurer ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9328: I see. I have much to thank you for.${prompt}
  9329: Ah, but words of thanks have little value to an adventurer, do they? Instead, I will give you these.${prompt}
  9330: |-
    It is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.
    Please take them as a symbol of my rrrespect for your skill as a ranger.${prompt}
  9331: And so, Chieftainness Perih Vashai, I leave this land behind me to begin my next hunt.${prompt}
  9332: '...And just like that, she leaves...${prompt}'
  9333: '...Hmmm, the Tracker''s real task here was most likely the destruction of the Bow of Light.${prompt}'
  9334: And not catching the sinner?${prompt}
  9335: I don't know for certain, but the homeland was definitely more concerned with the Bow of Light than the sinner's daughter.${prompt}
  9336: In that case, the magicite's power must truly be dreadful.${prompt}
  9337: |-
    ......
    Magicite rrresembles crystals. Or rather, the power contained in magicite is similar to, or perhaps greater than, that contained in crystals.${prompt}
  9338: But both are unnatural creations. The powerrr of magicite is an ominous, cursed energy. It is a manifestation of evil that we cannot tolerrrate.${prompt}
  9339: The Chieftainness of the Fire Tribe, Nhev Befrathi, knew this. And after seeing the bow for ourselves, the Mithran Tracker and I knew it too.${prompt}
  9340: That crystal calls to those of Mithran blood. It awakens feelings of envy, of jealousy. It darkens the nature of the heart.${prompt}
  9341: Nhev Befrathi and her daughter, however, had the strength to rrresist its influence. Even though they used the bow, the light in their hearts rrremained.${prompt}
  9342: |-
    ...I understand now.
    Perih Vashai, you lost the light when you drew back the string of that cursed weapon.${prompt}
  9343: Yes. I saw the power of that bow and closed my eyes to it.${prompt}
  9344: You desire nothing in a world where you see nothing. There is nothing to be afraid of.${prompt}
  9345: |-
    ......
    I rrrespect you, Perih Vashai. I don't know if I could have done the same in your place.${prompt}
  9346: But for that, I twisted the path you were to walk. To save Syu Befrathi, I erased the existence of my own daughter...${prompt}
  9347: '......${prompt}'
  9348: |-
    ...Perih Vashai.
    I have no feelings of hate towards you. It is my duty to listen to the voice of naturrre.${prompt}
  9349: |-
    I will come to see you again.
    Until then, may the wind guide your footsteps.
  9350: Occasionally, you too should try seeing the world through closed eyes.${prompt}
  9351: What is there, in your inner world? ...Who do you see?${prompt}
  9352: All of the children taken in by Heavens Tower lost their mothers. Under normal circumstances, they would be sent to our homeland to be cared for by other Mithra.${prompt}
  9353: You rrrealize why they were not sent to the homeland, don't you? The chieftainness wished to watch over the growth of her child, Semih Lafihna...Even if it meant being despised...${prompt}
  9354: We know what the chieftainness felt when she gave up her child for the sake of rrreturning the Bow of Light to its rrrightful place.${prompt}
  9355: She had to abandon her rrrole as a mother in order to fulfil her duties as a chieftainness, and as a ranger. I wonder if Semih Lafihna understands this?${prompt}
  9356: |-
    Ho there, adventurer.
    Have you come to take on the search for the ${item-plural: 1[2]}?${prompt}
  9357: There's actually no longer a need for it... But we should honor the brave warriors who brought about this time of peace.${prompt}
  9358: Well, if you find any, bring them here the same as usual.${prompt}
  9359: |-
    Ah, you've arrived.
    With your help, Semih Lafihna has become a little more rrreceptive to the words of the chieftainness.${prompt}
  9360: Now we have some peace around here. Especially since the Mithran Tracker has returned home convinced of the fate of the sinner's daughter.${prompt}
  9361: Hmmm? You also went to Eldieme Necropolis to confirm her death?${prompt}
  9362: |-
    Heh-heh-heh.
    That wasn't the rrremains of the daughter. It was the final rrresting place of her mother, Nhev Befrathi.${prompt}
  9363: We had another adventurer like you find a set of ownerless-earrings. We placed them in the necropolis long before you got there.${prompt}
  9364: Chieftainness Perih Vashai had predicted that another Mithran Tracker would show up eventually.${prompt}
  9365: 'But if you do happen to find any ${item-plural: 1[2]} in the Meriphataud Mountains, bring them here. I''ll buy them from you.${prompt}'
  9366: They belonged to the Mithran warriors responsible for bringing about this time of peace. They should be properly honored.${prompt}
  9367: 'If you ever find any ${item-plural: 1[2]} in the Meriphataud Mountains, bring them back here. I will buy them from you to honor the fallen.${prompt}'
  9368: We found many earrings but had a terrible time trying to find the missing halves...I thought furrr was going to fly.${prompt}
  9369: I wonder if the Mithran Tracker really believes that the daughter is dead... We can't let our guarrrd down yet.${prompt}
  9370: |-
    You found some?
    Here, take this with my thanks.${prompt}
  9371: |-
    Hello, adventurer.
    If you find any ${item-plural: 1[2]}, bring them here to me.${prompt}
  9372: Let us honor the Mithran warriors who fell in the Meriphataud Mountains.${prompt}
  9373: Captain Rakoh Buuma was sooo angrrry, y'know? She was saying something like, “Lately the guards of Windurst Woods have rrreally been slacking off! Slacking off completely!”...I think.${prompt}
  9374: |-
    Now that the airship route to the southern continent has been reopened, there might be some trrrouble amongst the Mithra of Windurst...I think.
    ...Gotta stay alert, y'know?${prompt}
  9375: Captain Rakoh Buuma has been fuming that the guards of Windurst Woods have “rrreally been slacking off, slacking off completely”!${prompt}
  9376: I wonderrr if she found out about me fishing during patrol duty? I'm not gonna fish anymorrre! I'm gonna do my job properly!${prompt}
  9377: W-we were r-reprimanded by Captain Rakoh Buuma. She was growling that we guards of Windurst Woods have rrreally been slacking off... “Slacking off completely,” she said!${prompt}
  9378: |-
    I, erm, I think she was angry b-because I, I don'taru get along with Mithra very well...
    M-maybe I sh-should try to invite Sola Jaab along on a fishing trip s-sometime.${prompt}
  9379: |-
    Ajido-Marujido...
    Minister of the Orastery and head of the Mage Academy. This mission has been issued by him.${prompt}
  9380: It says here that you should head to the Orastery right away. There's nothing written about the nature of the mission, but...it's a direct order from the ministerrr. You should hurry along.${prompt}
  9381: '...This is a mission ordered by Ajido-Marujido, head of the Mage Academy. He wants you to head to the Orastery rrright away.${prompt}'
  9382: The mission parameters are strictly confidential... I wonder what he'll ask of you?${prompt}
  9383: |-
    Where did she hear about it, I wonder...?
    Semih Lafihna, she like, totally wanted to know everything about this mission from Ajido-Marujido.${prompt}
  9384: |-
    She seemed kinda on edge, y'know?
    Even Captain Buuma, who like, totally hates Semih, was like, “Oh, okay, this is what the mission is about,”...or something like that.${prompt}
  9385: |-
    Things are so easygoing herrre lately.
    It's nice to have some peace in Windurst for a change.${prompt}
  9386: Up until now there have been so many heart-stopping incidents. Farrr too many. We should try and preserve this peace for a while.${prompt}
  9387: S-speaking of Minister Ajido-Marujido, I, I heard Minister Tosuka-Porika of the Optistery c-calling him a thiefy-wief.${prompt}
  9388: |-
    I, I mean, they've never been the besty-westy of friends, but I w-wonder what else could have h-happened?
    It gives me b-butterflies in my tummy-wummy.${prompt}
  9389: |-
    ......
    I mustaru help my brother...!
    I havetaru be strong...!${prompt}
  9390: You have been summoned to Heavens Tower by order of the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  9391: Could this be rrrelated to the arrest of Minister Ajido-Marujido by the Sibyl Guards? You will probably be interrogated on the details of your previous mission. Make haste to Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  9392: You have been summoned to Heavens Tower by order of the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  9393: '...Ah yes, if you happen to meet with Semih Lafihna, tell her this: No matter what the Star Sibyl says, we Mithra will follow the path of our beliefs.${prompt}'
  9394: The D-Dark D-Dungeon is the w-worst punishment that a criminal can g-getaru.${prompt}
  9395: There's n-no leaving the Dark Dungeon until you d-die. H-h-h-how h-h-h-horrible!${prompt}
  9396: |-
    What an uproarrr!
    There's been anotherrr incident!${prompt}
  9397: '...But being a Tarutaru problem, it''s probably nothing to get worked up about. He''ll just get a slap on the wrist and a week in jail or something similarrr, I would think.${prompt}'
  9398: I always thought Heavens Tower just did, y'know, prophecies and stuff. But the Star Sibyl rrreally, like, lays down the law when she has to.${prompt}
  9399: What did the Orastery minister get up to, anyway? I mean, what's under that crumbly old tower, like, y'know?${prompt}
  9400: Now that the Sibyl Guards are checking all the missions, it really gets my hackles up.${prompt}
  9401: Well, leaving all that aside, your next mission comes from the Optistery. They are rrrequesting assistance with tidying up the book vault.${prompt}
  9402: The Optistery must have been happy with your past performance to ask for you by name.${prompt}
  9403: Go to the Optistery and talk to the minister for the details of your mission.${prompt}
  9404: |-
    ...Oh, it's a little late, but...
    Congratulations on rrreaching rrrank seven.${prompt}
  9405: I, I, I don't like to talk aboutaru people this way, b-b-but please take c-c-care around the Sibyl Guards.${prompt}
  9406: |-
    I, I, I think they're k-k-k-eeping a close eye on y-y-you.
    W-w-watch your back on the streets at n-n-night...${prompt}
  9407: I despise cleaning, but I love those frog books.${prompt}
  9408: If I were a rank seven adventurerrr being offered this mission... Rrr, what a dilemma!${prompt}
  9409: You know the Minister of the Manustery...Miss Apururu? She doesn't like, y'know, smile as much as she used to.${prompt}
  9410: Even when she does smile, it's like, not rrreally a smile, y'know? I'm a girrrl, too. I know these things... I think.${prompt}
  9411: This is a mission issued by the Rrrhinostery.${prompt}
  9412: The Rrrhinostery wishes your help in a certain matter. Speak with the rrresearcher Leepe-Hoppe for the full details. He can be found on the second floor of the Rrrhinostery.${prompt}
  9413: I have a feeling something bad has happened. I hope you're able to straighten things out for them.${prompt}
  9414: This mission entails helping out the Rrrhinostery. Speak with the rrresearcher Leepe-Hoppe for the full details. He can be found on the second floor of the Rrrhinostery.${prompt}
  9415: The Sibyl Guards had nothing to say about this mission. Does this mean the Rrrhinostery is considered above suspicion? Or does it mean that something more sinister already has their full attention?${prompt}
  9416: I, I, I've heard that Minister R-R-Rukususu of the R-R-Rhinostery is investigating a-a-ancient ruins in the Northlands.${prompt}
  9417: S-S-She is looking into things like, erm...the reason why the Northlands have towers similar to the ones found in S-S-Sarutabaruta. Wh-wh-why would that be, I wonder?${prompt}
  9418: We Mithra came to Windurst from a village far to the south.${prompt}
  9419: '...I don''t really rememberrr much about it, though. Just that it was always hot.${prompt}'
  9420: |-
    Have you ever been to the southern continent?
    There are lots of, like, rrreally rrrare plants and stuff... I think.${prompt}
  9421: |-
    We use those plants to make, y'know, medicine and weapons and stuff like that.
    We Mithra are, like, children of nature, y'know?${prompt}
  9422: Before I explain your mission, I wish to congratulate you.${prompt}
  9423: |-
    Well done on rrreaching rrrank eight.
    There aren't many people who can make it this far.${prompt}
  9424: |-
    Rrright, down to brass tacks.
    Your next mission is from the Aurastery. You can get the details from the teachers at the School of Magic.${prompt}
  9425: The School of Magic is another name for the Aurastery. The teachers there will explain your mission objectives.${prompt}
  9426: Rrrecently, there have been rrrumors of feral Cardians gathering at the magic towers of the Horutoto Ruins. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?${prompt}
  9427: D-d-did you know that they h-h-have lots of m-m-magical dolls at the Aurastery?${prompt}
  9428: O-o-originally there were only a f-f-few types, but Professor Koru-Moru has re-re-remodeled them for various tasks.${prompt}
  9429: |-
    Let me see...
    ...You have ${choice: 1}[50/60/70/80/90/100] points!${prompt}
  9430: |-
    What do I mean, ${choice: 1}[50/60/70/80/90/100] points?
    Ah, now that would be telling!${prompt}
  9431: F...f...froggies!${prompt}
  9432: Meow!${prompt}
  9433: The Principal of the School of Magic is Professor Koru-Moru, y'know? But, like, a few years back, there was a different guy doing the job, y'know?${prompt}
  9434: What's really weird is that you don't hear anything about that guy. Tarutaru are, like, totally into their rumors, so I thought it was kinda strange.${prompt}
  9435: This mission has not been officially approved. However, all of the gatehouse guards have agreed to ask you to perform this task.${prompt}
  9436: Go to the Manustery and assist Minister Apururu. Those are your orders.${prompt}
  9437: I don't think I need to tell you this, but don't tell anyone about this mission. Be especially careful of that Semih Lafihna. She has a habit of picking up on rrrumors from the most unlikely places.${prompt}
  9438: Don't make me rrrepeat myself. Head to the Manustery and talk with Minister Apururu. This is your mission.${prompt}
  9439: Keep your orders to yourself, and be especially careful that Semih Lafihna doesn't get wind of what you're doing.${prompt}
  9440: Th-th-this is not a b-b-betrayal of the S-S-Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  9441: W-w-we just want to h-h-help Minister Apururu. The Orastery needs your h-h-help too.${prompt}
  9442: Things are getting exciting now! All the guards arrre in on this secret together!${prompt}
  9443: I can hardly contain myself! But I won't let on to anyone. I'll just flick my tail and keep it in.${prompt}
  9444: Miiri-Wohri is, like, totally freaked about this mission.${prompt}
  9445: But even if we, like, y'know, get found out and stuff, they'll just throw us all into the dungeon for a couple of days. It'll be like a sleepover!${prompt}
  9446: |-
    You have my thanks.
    I'm sure you've heard from the guards how terribly-werribly important this mission is to me.${prompt}
  9447: As you know, my brother, Minister Ajido-Marujido, has now spent a considerable amountaru of time in the Dark Dungeon.${prompt}
  9448: "My brother is a very resilient person. \nHowever, the Dark Dungeon is a chamber that drains magical power. To spend this much time in there...${prompt}"
  9449: |-
    I beg of you!
    Please help me save him! I know this goes against all the rules, but I have to help my brother!${prompt}
  9450: |-
    Help out?
    ${selection-lines}
    Leave it to me!
    It's too risky.${prompt}
  9451: |-
    ......
    That's true... But I know you can do it.${prompt}
  9452: |-
    ...Thank you.
    ${name-player}...${prompt}
  9453: I've been researching a way to save my brother.${prompt}
  9454: The chambers that lie beneath the central tower are sealed with the power of the stars and the moon. This means that the doors to those chambers can only be opened with an item imbued with that same power.${prompt}
  9455: The rings carry-warried by the ministers are such items. Every time a minister is appointed, a ring is made and presented to the new minister by Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  9456: 'After learning this, I took the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} and set off for the Dark Dungeon...${prompt}'
  9457: |-
    Give it up, Apururu.
    That seal is beyond you.${prompt}
  9458: Professor Shantotto...${prompt}
  9459: |-
    I heard you were sneaking around, asking people about the Dark Dungeon.
    Why don't you just stand at the top of Heavens Tower and yell, “I'm going to break my brother out of jail. Arrest me, someone!”${prompt}
  9460: |-
    How imprudent.
    And you were always such a bright student.${prompt}
  9461: I won'taru just stand by and let my brother waste away in there! But I can't...the door won't...${prompt}
  9462: |-
    I understand how you feel. I don't want to lose him either.
    Especially after all the trouble I've gone through to raise a tough-as-nails, wicked-wand-wielding, savage-spell-slinging wizard to take over as Orastery minister...${prompt}
  9463: Listen up and I'll explain about the door deep below the tower.${prompt}
  9464: This door, as you've discovered, can be opened by the power of the stars and the moon. Everything in the Horutoto Ruins is governed by this power.${prompt}
  9465: However, the magic sealing these doors was weakened when several of the towers were severely damaged during the Great War.${prompt}
  9466: And so up until now, these doors could have been opened with a single minister's ring--no need for a charm created by Heavens Tower, like before.${prompt}
  9467: '...!${prompt}'
  9468: |-
    Haven't you figured it out? What does that head of yours contain?
    You would have realized it by now if you were using that melon you call a brain.${prompt}
  9469: |-
    If you'll recall, Ajido-Marujido restored the power of the ruins, my dear dumpling.
    Now, you are no longer able to open the doors by using just a single ring.${prompt}
  9470: Ohoho, such stupidity!${prompt}
  9471: '......${prompt}'
  9472: |-
    ...Ah, forgive my amusement. I didn't come just to laugh at you.
    I have a brilliant idea to help your brother through.${prompt}
  9473: |-
    Really, Professor Shantotto?
    Please tell me what I have to do.${prompt}
  9474: |-
    Ohoho!
    You must gather the rings of the five ministers. Yes, yes. It is a chore.
    But, using their combined power, you should be able to dispel the seal on the door.${prompt}
  9475: |-
    Bring the five rings to my house in Windurst Walls.
    We can only get started when you have them all.
    Ohoho!${prompt}
  9476: Thank you so much, Professor. I will never forget this.${prompt}
  9477: |-
    You'd better not. Ah, and there's one more thing you'd better not forget.
    Don't think of going after the rings yourself. It would be something you'd regret.${prompt}
  9478: |-
    Leave it to an adventurer who's capable.
    Do you know ${name-player}? ${choice-player-gender}[He's/She's] very useful and usable.${prompt}
  9479: |-
    It almost boggles the mind how eager ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] is to stick ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] nose into some dangerous squeeze.
    There's no reason not to take advantage of ${name-player}'s natural tendencies.${prompt}
  9480: |-
    This is why I need your help.
    Here... This is my ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
  9481: I know it's a lot to ask, but...please save my brother. I beg of you.${prompt}
  9482: With the rings of the five ministers, I should be able to open the Dark Dungeon. Please gather all five rings and take them to Professor Shantotto.${prompt}
  9483: Please, save Ajido-Marujido. My poor, dear brother...${prompt}
  9484: We have a lot to thank Minister Ajido-Marujido for. He might have mumble-grumbled about it, but he was always there to bail the Manustery out of money troubles.${prompt}
  9485: We justaru follow whatever Minister Apururu decides. No mattaru what happens, we're behind her until the fat Galka sings.${prompt}
  9486: Minister Ajido-Marujido succeeded in reactivating the towers, didn'taru he?${prompt}
  9487: |-
    Isn't that a good thing?
    Why'd they have to go and throw him into the Dark Dungeon?${prompt}
  9488: |-
    “Rules were made to be broken.”
    That way of thinking got Minister Ajido-Marujido thrown in the slammer-wammer.${prompt}
  9489: |-
    And now his younger sister, Minister Apururu, has taken up the motto:
    “Jails were made to be broken.”${prompt}
  9490: |-
    Of course! I had totarully forgotten.
    When my brother was arrested, his ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} was confiscated by Heavens Tower...${prompt}
  9491: There's no way Semih Lafihna will just hand it over for no good reason. Maybe if you try talking with Kupipi...${prompt}
  9492: |-
    What's that!?
    The Cardians have chosen a king!?
    What on Vana'diel are they thinking!?${prompt}
  9493: I understand when Cardians no longer follow the orders of their masters. This happens when the concept of “master” ceases to have meaning to them.${prompt}
  9494: But after this has happened, they shouldn't be taking on a new master. For that to happen...${prompt}
  9495: |-
    ......
    No. It's not possible!${prompt}
  9496: |-
    ......
    But putting that aside for the moment, please take the rings to Professor Shantotto in Windurst Walls.${prompt}
  9497: I mustaru apologize, I was a little-bitty distracted by what you told me...${prompt}
  9498: '...Please take the rings to Professor Shantotto in Windurst Walls.${prompt}'
  9499: I mustaru apologize, I was a little-bitty distracted by what you told me...${prompt}
  9500: You've completed the preparations for opening the Dark Dungeon!? Wonderful! You have my mostaru heartfelt thanks!${prompt}
  9501: |-
    Now, to the Dark Dungeon we go!
    ...Oh, that won't do. Professor Shantotto said I shouldn't be seen traveling with you.${prompt}
  9502: We'll rendezvous by the door. Please be careful, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9503: |-
    Now, to the Dark Dungeon we go!
    ...Oh, that won't do. Professor Shantotto said I shouldn't be seen traveling with you.${prompt}
  9504: We'll rendezvous by the door. Please be careful, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9505: |-
    ${name-player}.
    ...My brother has yet to open his eyes...${prompt}
  9506: |-
    Professor Shantotto came to check on his condition, but there was nothing she could do...
    If he doesn't regain consciousness...${prompt}
  9507: |-
    ......
    But I must stay strong. Thank you, adventurer.${prompt}
  9508: I will never forget what you have done to help my dear brother.${prompt}
  9509: 'Oh, and about the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}... Professor Shantotto still...${prompt}'
  9510: Well, perhaps you should go and ask the professor.${prompt}
  9511: |-
    ${name-player}.
    ...My brother has yet to open his eyes...${prompt}
  9512: |-
    Professor Shantotto came to check on his condition, but there was nothing she could do...
    If he doesn't regain consciousness...${prompt}
  9513: |-
    Things don'taru look good.
    If Ajido-Marujido doesn't wake up, Minister Apururu may have murder-wurder to answer for...not just a jailbreak!${prompt}
  9514: |-
    Wait a minute.
    Wasn't there an adventurer who went to the dungeon with the minister? What if we shift all the blame onto ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]...?${prompt}
  9515: |-
    You're worried, rightaru?
    I'm worried about Minister Ajido-Marujido, too.${prompt}
  9516: I'm so worried, the Cardians I've made have learned how to sigh from me. What a dilemma. <sigh>${prompt}
  9517: |-
    I can'taru believe there was a jailbreaky!
    Minister Apururu is so cooly!${prompt}
  9518: But I get the feelingy there was someone along to help her... It went just a little too well for one of Minister Apururu's schemeys.${prompt}
  9519: There's a Windurst Waters merrrchant making a big fuss over a Mana Orb, you say?${prompt}
  9520: |-
    Ahaha, serves him rrright!
    That old coot, Honoi-Gomoi, always trrrying to get what he wants by any means possible.${prompt}
  9521: He seems terribly anxious to get his hands on that orb. Why don't you be a sporrrt and give it back? I promise I won't say anything.${prompt}
  9522: |-
    You want to talk to me about Mana Orbs?
    I'm sorry, but I'm up to my earlobes in work at the moment. Could you come back another time?${prompt}
  9523: |-
    This is...
    This is a terribly-werribly old Cardian card...${prompt}
  9524: But there's something strange about it. There's no mark, just this odd-bodd picture. I can't sense any magic from it, either.${prompt}
  9525: How unusual. Ordinarily, Cardian cards are imbued with powerful magic.${prompt}
  9526: The Cardian cards were a creation of my father, the previous Minister of the Manustery. The holder of the card could use it to remove the magic animating the card's respective Cardian.${prompt}
  9527: Do you understand the whammy-ramifications of this? The older Cardians could use the cards in their possession to deactivate other Cardians.${prompt}
  9528: '...My father had essentially made it possible for Cardians to kill each other, just like people can. Isn''t that horrible-worrible...?${prompt}'
  9529: |-
    Ah, forgive me!
    I seem to have drifted on to a darker topic.
    Enough of that, back to this card!${prompt}
  9530: This card holds no power over its respective Cardian. Which means it's more than likely just a reject.${prompt}
  9531: |-
    Either that...or could it be...
    This card has no respective Cardian?
    That would mean that this is a unique card...${prompt}
  9532: |-
    ${name-player}, please let me buy this card off you!
    I'm sure there's more to this than meets the eye!${prompt}
  9533: |-
    Have you heard?
    Ajido-Marujido has rrregained consciousness.${prompt}
  9534: Word of these goings-on has yet to rrreach Heavens Tower, so keep up the charade on your way to the Manustery.${prompt}
  9535: Ajido-Marujido had been in a coma since collapsing in the Dark Dungeon, rrright?${prompt}
  9536: He would probably be dead by now if no one had gone to save him. What an awful place.${prompt}
  9537: Th-the Orastery Minister has finally r-regained c-consciousness.${prompt}
  9538: D-do you realize now what a t-terrible-werrible place the Dark Dungeon is? Even a p-powerful mage like Ajido-Marujido wasn't immune to its e-effects.${prompt}
  9539: These Tarutaru sure can be a vicious little bunch.${prompt}
  9540: We Mithra would neverrr leave someone anguishing in torment like that. Those who transgress against Mithran law are cut down cleanly and face-to-face by the Mithran Trackerrr.${prompt}
  9541: Heavens Tower is gonna, like, totally notice that the Dark Dungeon is empty at any time now.${prompt}
  9542: We Mithra are born with, you know, a sixth sense and stuff. You can bet that Semih Lafihna's tail is totally twitching right now.${prompt}
  9543: Ah, ${name-player}--my dear brother has finally woken from his coma!${prompt}
  9544: He's right here. Please come with me!${prompt}
  9545: ${name-player}, we have some serious-werious problems!${prompt}
  9546: Thanks to you, I was able to see all that was written in the Book of the Gods. We must act before Windurst is wiped off the face of Vana'diel...${prompt}
  9547: After I found you missing from the Dark Dungeon, I knew I'd find you here, Ajido-Marujido!${prompt}
  9548: Semih Lafihna!?${prompt}
  9549: Great galloping gigas, I just can't get away from you...${prompt}
  9550: I'm not here to arrest you this time. You must come with me to Heavens Tower immediately!${prompt}
  9551: The bearer of darkness has returned!${prompt}
  9552: |-
    The bearer of darkness!?
    What of the Star Sibyl?${prompt}
  9553: We don't know. We haven't been able to open the door to her chambers. But with your magic, we should be able to get in...${prompt}
  9554: I don't think I've ever seen Semih Lafihna in such a tizzy-wizzy.${prompt}
  9555: The Star Sibyl... Ajido-Marujido... I hope they'll be okay...${prompt}
  9556: Goddess! Are you certain? Ajido-Marujido has received a pardon from the Star Sibyl!?${prompt}
  9557: And permission to enter Karaha-Baruha's Animastery... No matter how many times I hear it, I just can'taru believe it...!${prompt}
  9558: 'Apururu. I know you have-ethy a lot on your mind with Ajido-Marujido and all, but I wonder if I might have a moment-ethy?${wait-animation: 2}'
  9559: Doctor Yoran-Oran!${prompt}
  9560: Ahem. I was given this letter by an adventurer. Apparently it was dropped-ethy by a mandragora inside the Boyahda Tree...${prompt}
  9561: '...?${prompt}'
  9562: Wait, this handwriting...!?${prompt}
  9563: I see you recognize-ethy the author. He's being held-ethy prisoner somewhere in the Boyahda Tree, and needs help to escape.${prompt}
  9564: |-
    But I figured-ethy, considering who...
    I figured-ethy I should leave this mattaru up to you and your brother.${prompt}
  9565: So much has passed-ethy between you siblings and the author of that letter. I'll justaru pretend-ethy that I never saw it.${prompt}
  9566: Well, I've taken up enough-ethy of your time. Keep your chin up, little Apururu.${prompt}
  9567: What should I do...? I can't think straightaru. All this time I thought he had died.${prompt}
  9568: Goddess above! My father, alive! I don't know what to do. What should I do, adventurer?${prompt}
  9569: |-
    What to do?
    ${selection-lines}
    We must save him!
    Leave him to rot!${prompt}
  9570: Usually, that would be my firstaru thought, but...${prompt}
  9571: I almostaru wish I could, but...${prompt}
  9572: Could I ask you to help me? I want you to go to the Boyahda Tree and find my father...Zonpa-Zippa.${prompt}
  9573: And when you do find him, if...if he really is alive, I have some questions I want you to ask him. Why did the Cardians rise up against him? Who is this Cardian they have chosen for a king?${prompt}
  9574: |-
    Help Apururu?
    ${selection-lines}
    Leave it to me!
    Leave him to rot!${prompt}
  9575: I'm begging you. I have no desire to see my father again. I don'taru want to end up hating him even more than I do now.${prompt}
  9576: ${name-player}, thank you for being so understanding!${prompt}
  9577: Ah, one more thing. Please don't tell any of this to my brother. I wouldn't want news of our father to interfere with his importantaru research.${prompt}
  9578: If my father really is alive in the Boyahda Tree, I have some questions I want you to ask him. Why did the Cardians rise up against him? Who is this Cardian they have chosen for a king?${prompt}
  9579: I really should be asking my dear brother's advice on this mattaru, but I wouldn't want news of our father to interfere with his research...${prompt}
  9580: |-
    ...
    I still can'taru believe my father was alive...${prompt}
  9581: Hmm? You have a letter from him? An explanation for the actions of the Cardians?${prompt}
  9582: This is incredible...! Joker was created by the famous Karaha-Baruha...!?${prompt}
  9583: 'What was that bit about Karaha-Baruha?${wait-animation: 1}'
  9584: '...Ajido-Marujido!${prompt}'
  9585: What's wrong with you? You went all pasty-wasty white as soon as you saw me. What mischief have you been up to?${prompt}
  9586: I...${prompt}
  9587: I don't know what to say. To hear this...and on top of knowing the old coot was still breathing...${prompt}
  9588: The King of the Cardians is the creation of a dead genius? What on Vana'diel is going on!?${prompt}
  9589: There's something I don't understand. Who brought the Cardian back to life in the first place? How was this possible?${prompt}
  9590: You need a massive amountaru of magic to restore life to a Cardian. Not to mention the use of forbidden rituals...${prompt}
  9591: '...${prompt}'
  9592: Even more importantaru is the fact that the ritual would have brought Karaha-Baruha back from the dead.${prompt}
  9593: And if he really is alive and kicking again, why hasn't he been to see the Star Sibyl?${prompt}
  9594: Is there something preventaruing him from putting in an appearance? Or is he planning something, off in the shadows...?${prompt}
  9595: |-
    ...
    A summoning...${prompt}
  9596: That's it! Karaha-Baruha was focused on perfecting a “complete summoning.”${prompt}
  9597: Karaha-Baruha wasn't trying to enlist the aid of the Great Beast, Fenrir. He wanted to completely enslave its will.${prompt}
  9598: If he had succeeded in his efforts... Karaha-Baruha wouldn't be the only one brought back to life...${prompt}
  9599: ${name-player}! The Full Moon Fountain! We mustaru stop the Star Sibyl!${prompt}
  9600: ${name-player}, please go after my brother!${prompt}
  9601: The Full Moon Fountain...! I've got an awfully bad feeling about this!${prompt}
  9602: |-
    ...
    I g-got an advance on my s-salary...${prompt}
  9603: 'This m-month I have to try to g-get by on ${item-plural: 1[2]}...${prompt}'
  9604: |-
    ......
    Grrr...${prompt}
  9605: Captain Buuma said something that really upset me...! I'm in such a state, my furrr is starting to fall out...!${prompt}
  9606: I just saw Ajido-Marujido leaving the Manustery in, like, full view...${prompt}
  9607: Should he be, y'know, walking around outside and stuff? Shouldn't he be using, like, some sorta invisibility spell thingy?${prompt}
  9608: What happened at the Full Moon Fountain? I wanted to ask my brother, but he hasn't visitarued the Manustery at all lately.${prompt}
  9609: Maybe I should go to the Animastery to talk with him. Something about all this is really giving me the heeber-jeebers...${prompt}
  9610: I heard that Minsiter Ajido-Marujido was pardoned for his crimes. Well, isn'taru that a surprise?${prompt}
  9611: This is, y'know, one of those high-level, governmentaru things. There's gotta be some back room, political-type dealy-weals going on here.${prompt}
  9612: Do you know what's going on, ${name-player}? Ajido-Marujido has been pardoned for his crimes, and the guards have escaped any disciplinary action, despite our insubordination...${prompt}
  9613: Has something happened within Heavens Tower? They've sent us another mission for you.${prompt}
  9614: According to the mission statement, the Yagudo have proposed a rrrevision to the peace treaty...${prompt}
  9615: |-
    ...
    I'm well aware I shouldn't be poking my nose where it doesn't belong, but my Mithran instincts are making my tail twitch.${prompt}
  9616: Heavens Tower has rrrequested your presence. The Yagudo have sent a proposal to the Star Sibyl asking for a rrrevision of the peace treaty.${prompt}
  9617: The Star Sibyl is more likely to keep the peace, rrrather than object to any of the Yagudo's rrridiculous demands...${prompt}
  9618: |-
    ...
    Naturally, I have been informed of Semih Lafihna's report to Chieftainness Perih Vashai.${prompt}
  9619: Let us worry about the Yagudo--You just keep your mind on the task you have been given. Are we clear?${prompt}
  9620: M-Minister Ajido-Marujido has been a-absolved of his crimes! N-now Windurst can f-finally return to a state of peace!${prompt}
  9621: |-
    ...Wh-what?
    Wh-why are you l-looking at me with p-pity like thataru...?${prompt}
  9622: P-please don't t-tell me something else is wr-wrong!${prompt}
  9623: Captain Buuma was saying that our work might dry up completely after this next mission. If that happens, I'm gonna go hungry.${prompt}
  9624: That's why I've started fishing again. I bought the most amazing fishing rod! It was so nice of Miiri-Wohri to lend me the money!${prompt}
  9625: Even though you, like, totally trrrashed the beastmen's boss guy, the Yagudo still act like they're tougher than us.${prompt}
  9626: Something fishy's going on. It's like, the Yagudo are prrreying on our weaknesses...or something like that. You're, y'know, all important and stuff, so you should know what's going on, rrright?${prompt}
  9627: ${name-player}, you have the task of gathering the three verses left by the ancient ones, don'taru you?${prompt}
  9628: Ajido-Marujido mentioned Ro'Maeve, the Chamber of Oracles, and The Temple of Uggalepih...I'm pretty sure.${prompt}
  9629: All this talk of ancient peoples and places I've never-ever even heard of... My brother seems to have gained some amazing knowledge.${prompt}
  9630: I'm certain that we'll be able to save the Star Sibyl now that he's back with us. We mustaru play our parts, too.${prompt}
  9631: Minister Apururu has been up late every night, researchingy the old Cardians made by Zonpa-Zippa.${prompt}
  9632: It's really very simple if you wanted to disabley the old Cardians. All you would have to do is searchy out Minister Zonpa-Zippa and takey him out of the picture...${prompt}
  9633: |-
    Wa-wa-wait!
    That justaru slippedy out! I don'taru want to go to the Dark Dungeon!${prompt}
  9634: You would definitely be able to slow the Cardians down with a big ol' blast of magey-wagey power.${prompt}
  9635: But the problem is where do you get that kinda power, and who do you get to handle it? To be perfectaruly honest I don't think Miss Apururu is up to it.${prompt}
  9636: |-
    Hmmm...if you could draw on the Mana Orbs of all the Cardians in town then maybe...
    I better not suggestaru that to the minister, she would just keel over from worry.${prompt}
  9637: Minsiter Apururu is doing her bestaru to hide something from us...${prompt}
  9638: But she's so bad at lying-wying it makes it hard for us to pretend that we don't notice.${prompt}
  9639: '...I have heard from Semih Lafihna that a time of rrreckoning has come to this land.${prompt}'

  9642: '...Leave the Yagudo to us. We will not fall against the tides of evil. You, too, must make your stand.${prompt}'
  9643: There is no need for panic. We alrrready have details on the enemy's army within our grrrasp.${prompt}
  9644: We have done more than simply glare at the Yagudo these past twenty years.${prompt}
  9645: Several of our units are already concealed near the Yagudo strrronghold.${prompt}
  9646: As soon as the enemy makes its move, we'll go straight for the thrrroat. I can almost see the panicked faces of those Yagudo wrrretches.${prompt}
  9647: The magic doll...builtaru by Professor Koru-Moru...${prompt}
  9648: 'Wearing the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}...made by Doctor Shantotto...${prompt}'

    Oh, adventurer!
    You've brought all three verses!?${prompt}
  9651: It's time then! I mustaru go to Doctor Yoran-Oran's manor and pick up the finished work.${prompt}
  9652: My brother should be waiting in Heavens Tower. Please tell him that I'll be rightaru there!${prompt}
  9653: Adventurer! We mustaru hurry to the Full Moon Fountain!${prompt}
  9654: I have no idea what's going to happen, so we should be prepared for the doom-gloomiest worst. It may come down to a battle with the Bearer of Darkness!${prompt}
  9655: You have done your utmost for Windurst these many months. As the Captain of the Windurst Woods guards, I formally extend to you our gratitude and friendship.${prompt}
  9656: If I had my way, you would be permanently stationed in Windurst. However, I know that your adventurer's blood would never allow you to settle down for long.${prompt}

  9662: Oh, and by the way, I finally learned your name. You're ${name-player}, right?${prompt}
  9663: It could be just my imagination, but I feel like, y'know, all the Mithra in Windurst have finally become united in spirrrit.${prompt}
  9664: I also feel that we've become, like, buddies with all the little Tarutaru. And you, of course, ${name-player}. You're, like, my hero!${prompt}
  9665: I still can'taru believe it. Everything that happened at the Full Moon Fountain seems so surrealy-weal.${prompt}
  9666: It was so scary-wary, and so heartbreakingly sad. But both my brother and the Star Sibyl have come back to us safely.${prompt}
  9667: There was nothing I could've done by myselfily-welfily, but with everybody's help, we've broughtaru the light back to Windurst!${prompt}

    Thank you, everyone!
    I'm going to work even harder to make the world a better place for everybody to live in.${prompt}

  9670: With all the queasy-weasy experiments detailed in the previous minister's notes, though, I don'taru thinky Minister Apururu really wants to read through them...${prompt}
  9671: Maybe she's foundy some clues on how to stop those Cardians. Don't give up, Minister Apururu!${prompt}
  9672: Many Cardians died willingly for the sakey-wake of their king, the Cardian Joker.${prompt}
  9673: Former minister Zonpa-Zippa loved to build in those sorts of tragic loyalties... He probably put in a self-destructaru mechanism, too.${prompt}
  9674: The ring of the Manustery has finally-winally made its way back to the hand of Minister Apururu. Now I can make new and improved Cardian-wardians!${prompt}
  9675: Hmm, I think I'll inventaru one that has a spinning staff attack. That should make a nice breezey-weeze for those hot summer days...${prompt}
  9676: It has rrreturned. The great power that belongs to this land...${prompt}
  9677: I have come to realize that the world exists to help us find a way to bridge the gaps between the races.${prompt}
  9678: And we people are here to fill the emptiness that is borrrn in that world.${prompt}

    I prrray that the Windurst that lives in my heart will bloom in your heart as well.${prompt}
  9681: There was a place in Kazham where you could feel the power of the land.${prompt}
  9682: Twenty years ago that same grrreat energy overflowed from the plains of Sarutabaruta. All of our trrroubles began with the loss of that power.${prompt}
  9683: After the Great War, the Star Sibyl kept the truth of events from Chieftainness Perih Vashai.${prompt}
  9684: Considering the nature of Tarutaru, this is not altogether an unusual occurrence. But considering how we fought and died beside them for this land, I can't help but feel betrrrayed.${prompt}

  9687: All the loot my new boy'll bring in should stretch the Manustery's coffers to bursty-wursting! Not to mention the hefty raise that'll be added to my salary. <wink-wink>${prompt}

  9706: Take this untrrried bow. It is kindrrred to the slender sapling. As a young tree is bent by the fury of a storrrm, so will this bow's path be warped by your indecision.${prompt}
  9707: Now, my fledgling arrrcher. Go forth and overcome the winds of doubt that taunt your arrow's flight. Trrrain until the sapling bow has become a steady oak in your hands.${prompt}

  9712: |-
    Give in to your doubt?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I cannot go on.
    No, I will try harrrder.${prompt}
  9713: That is a pity indeed. You must set the bow free by your own hand. The withered branch rrreturns to the earth. This is the way of nature.${prompt}
  9714: When you feel the bow no longer rrresponds to your inner conflict, rrreturn it here to me.${prompt}
  9715: The bow still appears to rrretain the greenness of youth, and your doubt has yet to be rrresolved.${prompt}
  9716: There is no need for haste. The sapling grrrows slowly into the forest giant.${prompt}
  9717: This bow is no longer the sapling I gave you. It has become a mighty tree, grown straight and strong and true.${prompt}
  9718: You have grown as well, my fledgling arrrcher. It is time to test the new maturity of your archery.${prompt}

  9885: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  9886: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  9887: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  9888: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  9889: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  9890: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  9891: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  9892: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  9893: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  9894: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  9895: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  9896: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  9897: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  9898: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  9899: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  9900: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  9901: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  9902: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  9903: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  9904: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  9905: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  9906: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  9907: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'
  9908: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt}
  9909: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  9910: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  9911: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
  9912: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}

  9923: Strrrangely enough, her sins are related to the picture you speak of.${prompt}

  9925: A Mithran Trrracker traveled to Tavnazia to recover it, but was instead presented with a deal by the cardinal.${prompt}
  9926: A deal?${prompt}
  9927: The cardinal apparently knew everything about the legend rrrecited by the Mithra, and the duty that it entails.${prompt}
  9928: She also stated that the means to carry out that duty had been prepared in Tavnazia.${prompt}
  9929: |-
    The trrracker had no choice but to accept the deal.

    What is this legend, and what of the duty it reveals?

  9933: The sleeping gods...!?${prompt}
  9934: Surely you have heard the tale of the ancient rrrace that wounded Vana'diel by opening the Gates of Paradise?${prompt}
  9935: 'The Emptiness that poured from that wound tried to swallow everything in its path: the mountains, the seas, the skies, the forests, even life itself.${prompt}'
  9936: The living beings of Vana'diel decided to use the tears that Altana had shed to cleanse the world.${prompt}
  9937: However, a battle erupted between the king of people and the king of dragons over the fifth tear. A conflict that knew no end...${prompt}

    And this is the role that the cardinal attempted to fill?
    But how...?${prompt}
  9946: That has not yet been rrrevealed to me.${prompt}

  9948: Before she is punished for that crrrime...${prompt}
  9949: '...!${prompt}'
  9950: |-
    Do you need further explanation?
    The Mithran sin hunters never forgive a crime.
    The sin does not die with the sinner.${prompt}

    Be careful with your actions.
    It is not our place to judge your sins, but in time, your sins may come to judge you.${prompt}
  9952: What do you make of her words, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  9953: The theology of the Mithra veers quite dramatically from that of the San d'Orian Cathedral in several respects.${prompt}
  9954: The legend concerning the five tears of Altana is especially at odds with what the Elvaan believe...${prompt}

    Eh? You're here to get your ninja tools bundled?
    Curse Altana! And people ask me why I hate this stinkin' job!${prompt}

    Well, don't just stand there like an idiot! I can't do any bundlin' until you fork over a set of 99 tools and ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!

  10111: Have you ever heard of Blitz Buffalo, kupo? It's a fast and frenzied buffalo-chasing fiasco ferried in from a land to the far west of Quon!${prompt}
  10112: We moogles thought it sounded like fun! So we rounded up a bunch of buffalos and set them loose in several places, kupo!${prompt}
  10113: Also, we've tied an item to each buffalo! Anyone who catches one can keep the item as a reward! It's a great opportunity for adventurers, kupo!${prompt}
  10114: But the buffalos aren't going to take a bunch of frantic adventurers chasing them lightly! You may have to knock one out before it yields its precious item, kupo!${prompt}
  10115: If you manage to lay your hands on a buffalo, you better prepare to be flung around, kupo... Kupohoho～.${prompt}
  10116: |-
    Of course, it wouldn't be too good if you ended up being the one chased either, kupo!

  10117: It's time once again for the Starlight Celebration!${prompt}
  10118: We moogles have collected piles and piles of presents for the adventurers this time, kupo!${prompt}
  10119: We'd like to give them to each person individually, but everyone always seems to be off on some adventure or another, and we can't keep them all straight! Could you help us, kupo?${prompt}
  10120: Give this card to an adventurer and tell him or her to bring it to a moogle. We'll have a present waiting, kupo!${prompt}
  10121: There are four cards in all. Once you hand the first card out, I will ask the adventurer who brings it back to help with the next.${prompt}

    It's time for Valentione's Day celebrations, kupo!${prompt}
  10138: There is an amazing type of chocolate whose filling is influenced by your feelings! When chocolate halves from a boy and a girl are matched together, the resulting whole produces a wonderful taste if the couple is meant to be, kupo!${prompt}
  10139: Young men and women in this town have broken their chocolates in two, hoping to meet that “special someone”!${prompt}
  10140: We want adventurers to help each of them find their perfect match, kupo!${prompt}
  10141: 'Here''s what you should do, kupo: Take the two halves of a piece of chocolate from a Valentione Single.${prompt}'
  10142: There are four lonely guys and four forlorn girls who need your matchmaking expertise. Try talking to someone of the same gender as you, kupo!${prompt}
  10143: When they hand over their chocolate halves, the singles will give you hints about the type of person they're head-over-heels for, kupo.${prompt}
  10144: You should be able to find an adventurer of the opposite gender who is holding a chocolate half from the perfect paramour for your Valentione Single.${prompt}
  10145: Trade the right halves of the chocolates with your adventuring colleagues and try to match them with the left half you received from the Valentione Single.${prompt}
  10146: When matching the halves, the single who gave up the left half may also meet the preferences of the single who gave up the right half.${prompt}
  10147: If both the singles meet each other's preferences, you'll have a match made in heaven, kupo!${prompt}
  10148: Don't forget who you got your chocolate from! Try to do too many things at once and you'll end up confused, so we suggest you hand in the chocolate halves to a moogle one pair at a time, kupo～.${prompt}
  10149: We moogles can take your lonely pieces and make them into one whole, complete chocolate!${prompt}
  10150: Then all you have to do is return the finished chocolate to the person who gave you the original piece. One bite will tell them if they've found their perfect partner!${prompt}
  10151: After you've returned a whole chocolate to four Valentione Singles, return to a moogle and collect your reward, kupo!${prompt}
  10152: While you're playing matchmaker, you might meet someone who puts a sparkle in your eye, too. Kupohoho～!${prompt}

  10232: To play Azimuth Circle II, you'll need to team up with a partner and use a compass to search for a specific point.${prompt}
  10233: So your first step is to find that special somebody and form a party!${prompt}
  10234: Then talk to an event moogle, and we'll send you both out of town, kupo!${prompt}
  10235: We've set up several checkpoints outside.${prompt}

  10238: And it couldn't be easier to use! All the adventurers have to do is sit there and wait!${prompt}
  10239: Once the compass has stabilized, it will give you a hint to help you find your partner's checkpoint, kupo.${prompt}
  10240: But be careful not to relax too much! Just sitting there staring at the clouds won't help you at all, kupo. You have to concentrate the way you do when healing your wounds!${prompt}
  10241: And keep in mind that you will only learn about your partner's checkpoint.${prompt}
  10242: So help each other out and nothing should go wrong!${prompt}
  10243: Once you reach your checkpoint, you should find something buried there that will prove that you made it! You and your partner should trade your items with each other and then hand them to a moogle, kupo!${prompt}
  10244: That's all there is to it, kupo! You'll get a prize if you succeed, so I hope you do well!${prompt}

  10261: Kupo? That's not the partner you were with before! Changing partners in the middle of the game is against the rules, kupo.${prompt}
  10262: If you want to play with a different person, you should talk to one of us moogles and start the game over!${prompt}

    You should think hard about what to get them! You might say it's the thought that counts, but unfortunately, the children think otherwise!${prompt}

    So you let the thing get away... Well, I guess that's what I get for relying on an amateur. My bad, my bad.${prompt}

    Kupopopo～!
    This is terrible!
    Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!${prompt}

    But never fear!
    Our top moogle researchers have created weapons that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans--the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]} and the marvelous ${item-singular: 1[2]}, kupo!${prompt}
  10330: The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt}
  10331: But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!${prompt}
  10332: |-
    And that's not all!
    This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!${prompt}
  10333: You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!${prompt}
  10334: 'That''s why we want you to plant (${color: 5}trade${color: 1}) your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or ${item-singular: 1[2]} into the ground near a fallen fiend.

  10604: Chicks hatch from eggs, grow into young chocobos, and finally mature.${prompt}
  10605: They grow much faster than people do. Usually it takes about 1 month (Earth time) before you can ride your chocobo.${prompt}
  10606: The chocobo's traits are determined by the way in which you care for your animal. Without proper planning, you won't be able to raise the type of chocobo that you want.${prompt}

  10609: “Strength” is a term used to describe the chocobo's leg power. The more strength a chocobo has, the faster it will be able to run. Rental chocobos have been raised with an emphasis on this attribute.${prompt}
  10610: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  10611: “Endurance” is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.${prompt}
  10612: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  10613: “Discernment” is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.${prompt}
  10614: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  10615: “Receptivity” is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.${prompt}
  10616: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  10617: “Energy” is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.${prompt}
  10618: You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!${prompt}
  10619: “Affection” is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!${prompt}
  10620: You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.${prompt}
  10621: 'If you really want to raise your chocobo''s affection quickly, you can give it ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, but I can''t recommend doing so unless absolutely necessary.${prompt}'
  10622: “Satisfaction” is a term used to describe how full or hungry your chocobo is. If your chocobo is full, it will gain a lot of energy before the next day.${prompt}
  10623: However, when the chocobo is very hungry, its energy will hardly recover at all and its affection will rapidly decrease.${prompt}

  10625: A care schedule is a series of plans that you set up for your chocobo so that we can take care of it while you are away.${prompt}
  10626: How you want us to care for your chocobo each day is completely up to you.${prompt}
  10627: You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).${prompt}
  10628: When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.${prompt}
  10629: With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.${prompt}
  10630: The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.${prompt}
  10631: You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.${prompt}
  10632: The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.${prompt}
  10633: However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.${prompt}
  10634: We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.${prompt}
  10635: Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.${prompt}
  10636: Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.${prompt}
  10637: If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10638: Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.${prompt}
  10639: If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10640: Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.${prompt}
  10641: However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.${prompt}
  10642: If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10643: Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.${prompt}
  10644: But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.${prompt}
  10645: If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10646: You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  10647: The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.${prompt}
  10648: You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.${prompt}
  10649: The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.${prompt}
  10650: You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  10651: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  10652: You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.${prompt}
  10653: The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.${prompt}
  10654: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  10655: You can choose to have your chocobo act as an extra in a play to improve its receptivity.${prompt}

    Nothing.${prompt}
  10658: In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  10659: Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.${prompt}
  10660: On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.${prompt}
  10661: However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.${prompt}
  10662: You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  10663: Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.${prompt}
  10664: You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.${prompt}
  10665: I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)${prompt}
  10666: Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.${prompt}
  10667: This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.${prompt}
  10668: Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.${prompt}
  10669: You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.${prompt}
  10670: I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.${prompt}

    Pastes.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  10673: Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.${prompt}
  10674: However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.${prompt}
  10675: The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.${prompt}
  10676: At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!${prompt}
  10677: Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.${prompt}
  10678: There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!${prompt}
  10679: 'Just ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.${prompt}'

  10682: These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.${prompt}
  10683: Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.${prompt}
  10684: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, the effects are different.${prompt}'

  10688: Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  10689: Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!${prompt}
  10690: 'For example, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will dramatically increase your chocobo''s affection, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will restore its energy.${prompt}'

  10692: 'The most curious of all the worms is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...${prompt}'
  10693: Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  10694: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will restore your chocobo''s energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.${prompt}'
  10695: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.${prompt}'
  10696: A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.${prompt}
  10697: Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.${prompt}
  10698: You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.${prompt}

  10701: Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.${prompt}
  10702: For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.${prompt}
  10703: Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.${prompt}
  10704: But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.${prompt}
  10705: The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.${prompt}
  10706: Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.${prompt}
  10707: Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.${prompt}
  10708: Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.${prompt}
  10709: You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.${prompt}

  10718: 'When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10719: You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}

    Ah yes... I knew you'd want to hear about that.
    Well, first ride your chocobo out to the location indicated on your map.${prompt}
  11921: When you think you're close to where the treasure might be buried, take a test dig and see what happens.${prompt}
  11922: All chocobos have noses for finding burrried goods, and depending on how hot or cold you are (Get it? That's where we got the name for the game!) your steed will react differently.${prompt}
  11923: The closer you are, the more drrramatic that reaction will be, so listen carefully.${prompt}
  11924: When you think you've found the spot...${prompt}
  11925: '...dig and dig, and then dig some more!${prompt}'
  11926: I'll warn you right now, but some of the loot is pretty deep, so you may have to dig multiple times beforrre you uncover any chests.${prompt}
  11927: But, with a little bit of luck and a lot of bits of persistence, you'll be rolling in goodies in no time!${prompt}
  11928: That's rrright! Once you've unearthed the chest, all that's left is to open it. Whatever you find inside is yours to keep.${prompt}
  11929: Now, to increase your chances of finding treasure, you'll want to know how chocobo abilities can give you that extrrra edge.${prompt}
  11930: The ones that will help you most are “Treasure Finder,” “Burrow,” and “Bore.”${prompt}
  11931: Burrow and Bore will allow you to go deeper with each dig, helping you reach the chest beforrre your bird grows too tired.${prompt}
  11932: Treasure Finder does just that--helps you find the treasure easierrr by honing your chocobo's sense of smell.${prompt}
  11933: Alright, this part is the most important, so I'm going to need you to listen up.${prompt}
  11934: Digging for extended periods of time can rrreally drain a chocobo's strength.${prompt}
  11935: Push your bird too harrrd, and it may just reach that point where it refuses to dig anymore.${prompt}
  11936: When this happens, you might as well tighten the string on your gobbiebag because you won't be getting any morrre treasure that day.${prompt}
  11937: In other words, locating the chest in the fewest possible digs will be the key to your success.${prompt}
  11938: Remember that.${prompt}
  11939: Okay! Now I think you're finally rrready to head out there and start digging!${prompt}

  11994: Please note that only up to six chocobos can attend the camp at one time, so do not come as an alliance.${prompt}

    Return.${prompt}
  12155: |-
    Why not!?
    Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.${prompt}
  12156: We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A “win-win situation,” as we like to call it in the business.${prompt}
  12157: However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...${prompt}
  12158: The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.${prompt}
  12159: And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.${prompt}
  12160: Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!${prompt}
  12161: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  12162: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  12163: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  12164: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  12165: Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.${prompt}
  12166: Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.${prompt}
  12167: In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.${prompt}
  12168: Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.${prompt}
  12169: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12170: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  12171: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  12172: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  12173: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  12174: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  12175: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  12176: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  12177: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.${prompt}'
  12178: You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)${prompt}
  12179: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  12180: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  12181: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  12182: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  12183: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  12184: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
  12185: 'Ah, it says here that you are a member of the ${choice: 0}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.${prompt}'
  12186: Have you come today to change your affiliation?${prompt}
  12187: 'Remember, you will not be able to use any chocobucks earned in ${choice: 0}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst] here, and you will also lose any Solo Victory Points that you may have. Are you sure you want to go through with this?${prompt}'

  12449: 'Attendants at the chocobet centers are there to assist you with acquiring ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, as well as collecting your winnings.${prompt}'
  12450: There are a total of five centers readily available for your convenience, each of which are located near the transportation portals. There are two to the east and west of here, and one just to the north.${prompt}

  12452: The grandstand faces the racetrack itself, and allows spectators to sit and enjoy the races in comfort.${prompt}
  12453: To get there, just follow the red carpet all the way through the betting area. You can't miss it.${prompt}

    Race Progression.
    That's about it.${prompt}
  12464: A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.${prompt}
  12465: Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.${prompt}
  12466: In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.${prompt}
  12467: For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.${prompt}
  12468: The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.${prompt}
  12469: What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.${prompt}
  12470: Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  12471: Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.${prompt}
  12472: The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.${prompt}
  12473: The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.${prompt}
  12474: The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.${prompt}
  12475: In such an event, the “less endowed” of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.${prompt}
  12476: Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.${prompt}
  12477: Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the “race grade.”${prompt}
  12478: For example, a “C4 Chocobo Race” would indicate a typical grade 4 race.${prompt}
  12479: We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.${prompt}
  12480: No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.${prompt}
  12481: Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.${prompt}
  12482: As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.${prompt}
  12483: Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  12484: Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.${prompt}
  12485: Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.${prompt}
  12486: The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.${prompt}
  12487: As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.${prompt}
  12488: Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  12489: We have a total of four races that run in succession.${prompt}
  12490: Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.${prompt}
  12491: Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.${prompt}
  12492: Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!${prompt}

    Signing up for another race.
    I'm fine, thanks.${prompt}
  12494: There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.${prompt}
  12495: First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.${prompt}
  12496: Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a “race chocobo,” for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.${prompt}
  12497: Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...${prompt}
  12498: All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.${prompt}
  12499: A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.${prompt}
  12500: Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.${prompt}
  12501: There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.${prompt}
  12502: There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.${prompt}
  12503: 'Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.${prompt}'
  12504: 'In the event that you should lose or misplace your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.${prompt}'
  12505: The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!${prompt}
  12506: You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.${prompt}
  12507: 'To collect, simply hand in the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you received during race signup at any signup center.${prompt}'
  12508: The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.${prompt}
  12509: You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.${prompt}
  12510: After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).${prompt}
  12511: This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.${prompt}
  12512: We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.${prompt}
  12513: |-
    What would you like to ask?
    ${selection-lines}
    What is chocobetting?
    How do I bet?
    What are odds?
    When do I bet?
    How do I collect winnings?
    Nothing.${prompt}
  12514: Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.${prompt}
  12515: To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.${prompt}
  12516: Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.${prompt}
  12517: For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.${prompt}
  12518: And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.${prompt}
  12519: Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.${prompt}
  12520: The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!${prompt}
  12521: 'To place a chocobet, you must obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the chocobet center. ${prompt}'
  12522: 'For any single ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.${prompt}'
  12523: We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.${prompt}
  12524: Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.${prompt}
  12525: Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.${prompt}
  12526: It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.${prompt}
  12527: What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.${prompt}
  12528: 'Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.${prompt}'
  12529: The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.${prompt}
  12530: Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.${prompt}
  12531: Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.${prompt}
  12532: Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.${prompt}
  12533: 'Once the race is finished, you can exchange your ${item-singular: 0[2]} at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.${prompt}'
  12534: 'Without ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  12535: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.${prompt}'
  12536: Should one week pass, we will be unable to accept the ticket, so it is always best to cash out as soon as possible.${prompt}

  12599: With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.${prompt}
  12600: As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!${prompt}
  12601: “The Monster Races”!${prompt}
  12602: Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing! ${prompt}
  12603: |-
    Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele.
    What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?${prompt}
  12604: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  12605: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  12606: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  12607: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  12608: Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!${prompt}
  12609: |-
    The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal.
    It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.${prompt}
  12610: |-
    Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern.
    If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.${prompt}
  12611: |-
    Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area.
    Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.${prompt}
  12612: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12613: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  12614: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  12615: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  12616: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  12617: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  12618: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  12619: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  12620: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo''s performance.${prompt}'
  12621: |-
    You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers.
    Thank you for your understanding.${prompt}
  12622: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  12623: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  12624: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  12625: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  12626: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  12627: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
  12628: Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.${prompt}
  12629: |-
    We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence.
    The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.${prompt}
  12630: |-
    Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits.
    And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.${prompt}
  12631: |-
    As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind.
    It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack.
    Consider yourself warned.${prompt}
  12632: |-
    In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well.
    Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part.
    It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!${prompt}
  12633: |-
    Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed.
    These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.${prompt}

  12701: 'First we have ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}, who will be ridden by ${choice: 1}[the ace of the chase, Ignazio/three-time chocobo racing all★star, Eudocia/the bloody emperor, Roinolier/the empress of speed, Maurette/Lami-Baami Suave Esquire III/the red rose of racing, Sosopapa/CRA legend, Khowa Mathgalhi/rising CRA star, Bayansh].${prompt}'
  12702: ピヨピヨ！${prompt}
  12703: She says, “When the ace makes chase, there's not a bird in Vana'diel who can keep pace.”${prompt}
  12704: She says, “And you can bet the chocobo farm that this year it'll be 'four-time' all☆star!“${prompt}
  12705: She says, “This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean.”${prompt}
  12706: She says, “There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed.”${prompt}
  12707: She says, “This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say.”${prompt}
  12708: She says, “Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn.”${prompt}
  12709: She says, “This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race.”${prompt}
  12710: She says, ”This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'”${prompt}
  12711: 'Next we have ${choice: 0}[Pure Beauty/Ambitious Impact/Young Typhoon], being ridden by ${choice: 0}[the chocogirl next door, Hazina/dark chocostalker, Pikanza/self-proclaimed chocogeek, Qunbubu].${prompt}'
  12712: Sakura says, “Don't be fooled by the innocent smile--this girl will rip your chocobo's gizzard out and eat it for a late breakfast or early lunch!”${prompt}
  12713: Sakura says, “This Galka's unrelenting love for all things chocobo makes him a dangerous opponent on the track.”${prompt}
  12714: Sakura says, “Thousands of hours of chocoresearch have sharpened the mind of this jolly jockey into a pointy stick, ready to poke and prod anyone who dares stand in her way.”${prompt}
  12715: 'Our next chocobo is ${choice: 0}[Shining Lady/Moon Night/Jet Fire], ridden by ${choice: 0}[Chanaille, a.k.a. Dances With Chocobos/the chocowhisperer, Sah Zhaowam/Sakura''s number one fan, Chamu-Pashamu].${prompt}'
  12716: Sakura says, “Ain't no one knows a chocobo's heart like this here lil' lady.”${prompt}
  12717: Sakura says, ”She has a good grasp of our vocabulary, but her pronunciation, especially her gutturals and fricatives, need a little work.”${prompt}
  12718: ピヨ～♪${prompt}
  12719: Sakura says she knows who she'll be rooting for this race...${prompt}
  12720: 'The next contestant is ${choice: 0}[Invincible Ace/Gold Queen/Million Spirit], jockeyed by ${choice: 0}[chocobo reincarnate, Vieuballideme/hyper breeder, Graciela/20-year racing veteran, Mayza-Hapurza].${prompt}'
  12721: She says that simply smelling like a chocobo doesn't make one a chocobo.${prompt}
  12722: She says that breeding chocobos is like stocking a warehouse with 10,000 opo-opos and 10,000 typewriters--you are bound to stumble across a masterpiece sooner or later.${prompt}
  12723: She says that this Tarutaru has been practicing the choquestrian arts since he was only two years old.${prompt}
  12724: And that's our lineup. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a feeling that today's match up will go down in the annals of racing history.${prompt}
  12725: And here's today's lineup. What excitement lies in store for all our faithful chocofans listening on the CRA linkshell channel?${prompt}
  12726: The contestants have arrived at the starting line, and the race will begin shortly.${prompt}
  12727: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to another round of awe-inspiring head-to-head chocobo racing! I am Goccilo, your master of ceremonies.
  12728: And joining us today are the commentating duo which require no introduction, the equally adroit and adorable Sakura...
  12729: '...and her obedient interpreter, everyone''s favorite lover of animals, Markovich!'
  12730: Good day, fol--
  12731: ピヨ！
  12732: 'Sakura would like to take this opportunity to speak out against fowl abuse across Vana''diel. '
  12733: And on that note, here come our eight avian racers now!

    #${number: 4}: ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}

    #${number: 7}: ${unknown: 0x01058482838080}
  12735: And there's your lineup, folks! It looks like we're going to have a real doozy on our hands here today!
  12736: Well, let's get right down to it! The race is about to begin!
  12737: I must admit, I was a tad vexed about who our bird might be facing today, but I realize now that my petty presentiments were quite unfounded.${prompt}
  12738: Yeah! What he said! You're lucky we're even letting you share the same track as Best!${prompt}
  12739: |-
    Yeah...
    Good luck, ${name-player}...${prompt}
  12740: Today's match is a head-to-head battle, with the winner taking all! Let's start off by introducing our two competitors.${prompt}
  12741: 'And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, ${choice: 0}[Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].${prompt}'
  12742: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'”${prompt}
  12743: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.”${prompt}
  12744: Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.${prompt}
  12745: They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.${prompt}
  12746: Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], Wahboud!${prompt}
  12747: Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!${prompt}
  12748: As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.${prompt}
  12749: ${name-player}. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.${prompt}
  12750: Good luck, ${name-player}. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!${prompt}
  12751: Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!${prompt}
  12752: 'And next we have ${choice: 0}[Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by ${choice: 0}[VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].${prompt}'
  12753: ピヨッ！${prompt}
  12754: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.”${prompt}
  12755: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.”${prompt}
  12756: Sakura says, “Big things often come in small packages.”${prompt}
  12757: Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--${prompt}
  12758: a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!${prompt}
  12759: This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.${prompt}
  12760: Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!${prompt}
  12761: It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted “piece de resistance”?${prompt}
  12762: We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.${prompt}
  12763: Well, there you have it.${prompt}
  12764: Now let's take a look at today's participants...${prompt}
  12765: |-
    Ladies and gentlemen!
    President of the Bastokan Republic, Hrichter Karst, proudly presents...${prompt}
  12766: '...the most prestigious chocobo race in all of southern Quon--the Gustaberg Derby!${prompt}'
  12767: Joining me today is Metalworks mastermind, Cid.${prompt}
  12768: Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?${prompt}
  12769: Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  12770: Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--${prompt}
  12771: The Rakapopo Cup!${prompt}
  12772: Today's guest is Heavens Tower's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Ku～pipi～!${prompt}
  12773: So～,♪ I've lea～rned that yo～u have entered♪ your ve～ry own pe～rsona～l♪ cho～cobo in the cu～p.♪ Wha～t do yo～u think her♪ cha～nces are of ta～king♪ ho～me the gra～nd pri～ze?♪${prompt}
  12774: Are yo～u making fun of me, si～r!? We～ll, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my～ gutty-wutty when my Starlight sai～ls across the finish line yea～rs before the nearest competitaru!♪${prompt}
  12775: Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.${prompt}
  12776: My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!${prompt}
  12777: '${choice: 0}[Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing all★star/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Ne～ver heard of ${choice: 0}[him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!${prompt}'
  12778: We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one “Kamp Kweh.” We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.${prompt}
  12779: Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...${prompt}
  12780: Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take mo～re than an embiggened brainy-wa～iny to beat Starlight!♪${prompt}
  12781: What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.${prompt}
  12782: Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...${prompt}
  12783: Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fa～n! I won't let Starlight lo～se to some impo～ster!${prompt}
  12784: Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called “reincarnate's” redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!${prompt}
  12785: Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?${prompt}
  12786: Hah! Well, I～ have been riding cho～cobos for twenty-one years!${prompt}
  12787: 'And next is ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by ${choice: 1}[San d''Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d''Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!${prompt}'
  12788: Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.${prompt}
  12789: Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...${prompt}
  12790: Both Starlight a～nd the professor hate to take orders... Maybe tha～t's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!♪${prompt}
  12791: The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.${prompt}
  12792: When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.${prompt}
  12793: When the profe～ssor's not stumbling over his spee～ch impediment-ethy, he's re～searching the intricacies of chocobo beha～vioral patterns.${prompt}
  12794: And they're off!
  12795: Markovich, what did you think of the start?
  12796: Well, I fel--
  12797: ピヨピヨッ！
  12798: Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.
  12799: Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  12800: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  12801: And as they pass the halfway mark...
  12802: '#${number: 1} ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} holds on to the lead!'
  12803: '${number: 0} different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!'
  12804: 'While from behind the pack, #${number: 1} ${unknown: 0x01058482838080} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  12805: 'While from behind, #${number: 2} ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  12806: 'All ${number: 0} chocobos battle for the lead!'
  12807: Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!
  12808: And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!
  12809: ピヨピヨ！
  12810: Sakura says, “The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.”
  12811: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  12812: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  12813: 'Incredible! ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}''s speed is approaching dangerous limits!'
  12814: 'It looks like ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!'
  12815: '${unknown: 0x01058482808080} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  12816: '${unknown: 0x01058482808080}''s speed has begun to drop off!'
  12817: 'It looks like ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} has begun to tire!'
  12818: The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  12819: The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  12820: The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!
  12821: The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!
  12822: 'The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}!?'
  12823: 'Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}!?'
  12824: 'And yet ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} seems completely unaffected by the attack!'
  12825: And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  12826: And now they're approaching the final corner!
  12827: '#${number: 1} ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  12828: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  12829: '#${number: 1} ${unknown: 0x01058482838080} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  12830: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead!'
  12831: The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  12832: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching #${number: 1} ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} today!'
  12833: 'And ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} takes the crown!'
  12834: 'What''s this? #${number: 1} ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} is making its move on the lead!'
  12835: 'And it''s ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} by a beak!!!'
  12836: Let's take a look at the results...${prompt}
  12837: '${number: 2}: ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} (#${number: 1})${prompt}'
  12838: There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!${prompt}
  12839: Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.${prompt}
  12840: Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.${prompt}
  12841: Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.${prompt}
  12842: |-
    What an amazing race!
    The other chocobos were no match for ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?${prompt}
  12843: 'What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird''s performance?${prompt}'
  12844: '${choice: 0}[Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!${prompt}'
  12845: The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.${prompt}
  12846: Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!${prompt}
  12847: Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...${prompt}
  12848: Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exa～ctly as I expected!♪${prompt}
  12849: The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no wa～y Starlight could lose! Her horoscope sai～d so!${prompt}
  12850: |-
    And there you have it.
    This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!${prompt}
  12851: And now, let's see the results from the last race.
  12852: '${number: 2}: ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} (#${number: 1})'
  12853: And that's all she wrote, folks!
  12854: 'The winnings for a ${number: 0}-${number: 1} bet come to ${number: 2} gil per quill!'
  12855: Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?
  12856: She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!
  12857: She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.
  12858: Until next time, race fans...
  12859: Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.${prompt}
  12860: 'Taking the crown for today''s race was none other than ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}!${prompt}'
  12861: 'To the winning steed''s owner we present the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Rocochookie,” I mean, “Chocorookie”!${prompt}'
  12862: 'And to the ambitious and sporting ${name-player}, we present this undeniably useful ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  12863: Good show, ${name-player}. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.${prompt}
  12864: |-
    Excellent race, ${name-player}!
    You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.${prompt}
  12865: Okay, ma～ybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I sti～ll think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!${prompt}
  12866: Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.${prompt}
  12867: But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.${prompt}

  12883: I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.${prompt}

    Is that so...?
    Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...${prompt}

  12888: |-
    But of course! I had forgotten all about it!
    Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you!
    Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!${prompt}
  12889: |-
    But that's not where it ends!
    There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?${prompt}
  12890: |-
    A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself.
    Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?${prompt}
  12891: It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.${prompt}
  12892: |-
    Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state!
    But...${prompt}
  12893: But...?${prompt}
  12894: I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.${prompt}
  12895: |-
    I see...
    Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?${prompt}
  12896: |-
    You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo.
    Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?${prompt}
  12897: |-
    But enough talking, I say.
    It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!${prompt}
  12898: |-
    Oh, yes, right...
    Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay!
    It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!${prompt}
  12899: 'In the chocobo corner, we have ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.${prompt}'
  12900: |-
    Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo?
    I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.${prompt}
  12901: '${unknown: 0x01058482808080}''s formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don''t let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, “a wolf in sheep''s clothing”!${prompt}'
  12902: I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!${prompt}
  12903: I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?${prompt}
  12904: Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that “monsters” like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.${prompt}
  12905: Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!${prompt}
  12906: With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!${prompt}
  12907: |-
    Whoopee!
    Bring them on, I say!${prompt}
  12908: |-
    Erm...yes...
    Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.${prompt}
  12909: Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.${prompt}
  12910: |-
    Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki!
    Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.${prompt}
  12911: |-
    Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo.
    I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.${prompt}
  12912: And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!${prompt}
  12913: |-
    My, oh my...!
    I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--${prompt}
  12914: |-
    A-ahem!
    I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.${prompt}
  12915: |-
    All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies!
    Well done, my pretty! Well done!${prompt}
  12916: |-
    It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders...
    <Sniffle>${prompt}
  12917: |-
    Next in the lineup is Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    ...!? What on Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  12918: |-
    Hrmmm...
    Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.${prompt}
  12919: Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...${prompt}
  12920: |-
    What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man!
    There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!${prompt}
  12921: Um, yes... Please forgive me...${prompt}
  12922: |-
    And won't you look at the lineup!
    This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks?
    I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?${prompt}
  12923: And with me today is our regular guest commentator...${prompt}
  12924: |-
    Huh?
    Why isn't Markovich here?${prompt}
  12925: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.${prompt}
  12926: |-
    <Gulp>
    You...you're that mage from Windurst...${prompt}
  12927: '...Professor Shantotto!${prompt}'
  12928: |-
    If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich,
    as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.${prompt}
  12929: |-
    Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence,
    four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.${prompt}
  12930: |-
    So if you care to hear out my little proposal,
    these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.${prompt}
  12931: |-
    With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice...
    Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?${prompt}
  12932: |-
    With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused?
    Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.${prompt}
  12933: First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.${prompt}
  12934: |-
    Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold.
    I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.${prompt}
  12935: Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.${prompt}
  12936: |-
    Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word “failure.”
    Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.${prompt}
  12937: Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.${prompt}
  12938: |-
    Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable.
    If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.${prompt}
  12939: Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!${prompt}
  12940: |-
    For Ace of Trophies, “championship contender” is an unfitting description.
    Even “consecutive champion” would not be too high an expectation.${prompt}
  12941: |-
    Um...Professor Shantotto...
    Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?${prompt}
  12942: |-
    Ohohohohoho!
    Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so.
    But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!${prompt}
  12943: |-
    Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage.
    Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.${prompt}
  12944: |-
    Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview.
    So let the race begin, without further ado!${prompt}
  12945: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    Of this inevitable result, I was always assured--
    that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!${prompt}
  12946: |-
    The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor.
    But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.${prompt}
  12947: |-
    H-hey!
    What do you think you're trying to pull here!?${prompt}
  12948: |-
    My, my, what a pleasant surprise!
    I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.${prompt}
  12949: |-
    How dare you “ohoho” your way into my hard-earned commentary seat!
    This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!${prompt}
  12950: |-
    Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification.
    I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.${prompt}
  12951: |-
    And you, Goccilo!
    What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!${prompt}
  12952: |-
    Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing!
    Until next time...!${prompt}
  12953: ${name-player}, I knew you'd make it all the way here.${prompt}
  12954: |-
    What's with the baffled expression?
    It's me, Sakura.${prompt}
  12955: |-
    You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird.
    I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.${prompt}
  12956: I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.${prompt}
  12957: I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...${prompt}
  12958: And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.${prompt}
  12959: I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.${prompt}
  12960: Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.${prompt}
  12961: I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  12962: I hope that'll be your chocobo, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  12963: |-
    And next, we have Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    But something seems to be different...
    Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.${prompt}
  12964: She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!${prompt}
  12965: The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.${prompt}
  12966: |-
    I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround!
    A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.${prompt}
  12967: And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.${prompt}
  12968: It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.${prompt}
  12969: |-
    And that completes the lineup, folks.
    With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!${prompt}
  12970: 'You find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  12971: Welcome to the Dream Race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12972: I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.${prompt}
  12973: I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.${prompt}
  12974: I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.${prompt}
  12975: |-
    But no more...
    If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.${prompt}
  12976: This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.${prompt}
  12977: I won't hold back in today's race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12978: Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.${prompt}
  12979: Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  12980: I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?${prompt}
  12981: Next, we have Sakura...${prompt}
  12982: |-
    Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?
    This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!${prompt}
  12983: |-
    Well I'll be...
    In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!${prompt}
  12984: '...${prompt}'
  12985: |-
    Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks.
    For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?${prompt}
  12986: '${name-player}, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Chocochampion”!${prompt}'
  12987: |-
    Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far!
    Congratulations!${prompt}
  12988: |-
    Great race, ${name-player}.
    It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.${prompt}
  12989: |-
    But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come..
    With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...${prompt}
  12990: |-
    Princess...
    Princess Sakura!${prompt}
  12991: |-
    Princess...?
    What are you talking about? Who are you?${prompt}
  12992: |-
    Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion.
    I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.${prompt}
  12993: Searching for...me?${prompt}
  12994: |-
    Yes, Your Highness.
    You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.${prompt}
  12995: |-
    Are you serious!?
    Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?${prompt}
  12996: |-
    That is correct.
    Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.${prompt}
  12997: D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?${prompt}
  12998: |-
    ...!
    I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...${prompt}
  12999: Wh...what happened?${prompt}
  13000: |-
    You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world.
    You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...${prompt}
  13001: She...she gave up her life to save me?${prompt}
  13002: |-
    Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again.
    But, I never once gave up hope...${prompt}
  13003: My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.${prompt}
  13004: So that's what happened...${prompt}
  13005: Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos! ${prompt}
  13006: '...${prompt}'
  13007: I'm sorry, but I can't go.${prompt}
  13008: |-
    Your Highness!
    But...why!?${prompt}
  13009: Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like ${name-player}'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.${prompt}
  13010: What's more...${prompt}
  13011: I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...${prompt}
  13012: I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.${prompt}
  13013: What...?${prompt}
  13014: The only place I belong is here, beside you.${prompt}
  13015: |-
    And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer?
    I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?${prompt}
  13016: I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!${prompt}
  13017: |-
    Heehee!
    Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!${prompt}
  13018: |-
    ${name-player}, I'm looking forward to our rematch!
    Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?${prompt}
  13019: You're still here, eh, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13020: Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?${prompt}
  13021: |-
    What?
    How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?${prompt}
  13022: |-
    Hohoho...
    It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.${prompt}
  13023: I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...${prompt}
  13024: |-
    Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos?
    No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.${prompt}
  13025: Sakura is the queen, you say?${prompt}
  13026: |-
    <Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises.
    But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.${prompt}
  13027: |-
    You know what they say: Home is where the heart is.
    To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.${prompt}
  13028: |-
    And you, our new Chocochampion!
    Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.${prompt}
  13029: |-
    Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today.
    These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.${prompt}
  13030: And they're off!
  13031: |-
    Hrmmm!
    ${choice: 0}[Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!
  13032: Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?
  13033: |-
    All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance.
    But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.
  13034: Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  13035: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  13036: '${unknown: 0x01058482808080} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  13037: The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  13038: The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!
  13039: And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  13040: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  13041: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead!'
  13042: The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  13043: 'What''s this!? ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} has used ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!'
  13044: '${unknown: 0x01058482808080} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  13045: '${unknown: 0x01058482808080} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  13046: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} today!'
  13047: 'What''s this? ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} is making its move on the lead!'
  13048: '${number: 1}: ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}${prompt}'
  13049: 'What''s this!? ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}''s using ${choice: 1}[Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!'
  13050: 'Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those ${choice: 0}[monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!'
  13051: |-
    ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed!
    And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!
  13052: "I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}'s step. \nAnd the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!"
  13053: |-
    And here's some unexpected drama, folks!
    The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?
  13054: 'Look at that! ${lettercase: 1}${unknown: 0x01058482808080}''s stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!'
  13055: |-
    Uh-oh, what's going on here!?
    The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!
  13056: 'Oooh! In a bold move, ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} has just used a ${choice: 0}[Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!'
  13057: |-
    What's this!?
    All of the chocobos other than ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!
  13058: |-
    Thanks to that brazen little act, ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks!
    That just might seal the deal for ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}!
  13059: |-
    Never in all my days, race fans!
    In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!
  13060: |-
    How could my creation make such a rookie mistake?
    In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!
  13061: Shantotto starts casting Tornado!
  13062: The speed of the chocobos has dropped!
  13063: The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!
  13064: The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!
  13065: |-
    Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!?
    What in the world do you think you're doing!?
  13066: |-
    Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame.
    This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.
  13067: |-
    What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today?
    I've heard it being said that today's ${choice: 0}[creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal.
    This could get heavy, folks!
  13068: |-
    All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them.
    Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?
  13069: It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!
  13070: |-
    There's still plenty of race to go, race fans!
    More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!
  13071: And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!
  13072: |-
    The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now.
    This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!
  13073: |-
    This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent.
    Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!
  13074: |-
    And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty!
    Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!
  13075: |-
    And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them!
    But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?
  13076: |-
    I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call!
    Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?
  13077: |-
    It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now!
    The time for a final spurt is now or never!
  13078: And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?

  13100: Venture roll is a competitive game played with dice similar to those used by corsairs. The objective is to roll until your cumulative total comes as close to 11 as possible without going over.${prompt}

    Rules? Why, they are simple, my friend!

  13168: Which lairs? Must I tell you everything, adventurer? Moogle intelligence reports that the crystals can be found in the Ghelsba Outpost, Davoi, the Palborough Mines, Giddeus, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja. Now what are you waiting for, kupo!?${prompt}
  13169: You see, recently there has been much unrest amongst our many Moogle factions, kupo.${prompt}
  13170: Why, you ask? Well, at one of our gatherings, an argument broke out regarding the Crystal War 20 years gone.${prompt}

  13172: And from there things degraded into a shouting match pitting San d'Oria versus Bastok versus Windurst, kupo...${prompt}
  13173: However, at the end of the day, no one could present hard evidence to the claim of their nation's greatness.${prompt}
  13174: And that is when one of our elders came up with a foolproof method to put an end to our doubts--we would have adventurers from all three nations fight the war again, kupo!${prompt}
  13175: By fighting, I don't mean fighting each other, but fighting the beastmen like our fathers did 20 years ago!${prompt}
  13176: One of the ways the allied armies were able to defeat the enemy was by intercepting and cutting off the Shadow Lord's crystal supply routes.${prompt}
  13177: We want you and other adventurers from across Vana'diel to take on the roles of allied solders and infiltrate beastman strongholds, kupo.${prompt}
  13178: Once inside, you are to locate large formations where the beastmen have been storing crystals over the past two decades...${prompt}

    Here's the reward for your efforts.
    And a bonus balloon, justaru for you!${prompt}
  13259: |-
    Huh? Did the heat just ease off a notchy-wotch? I'll bet it was you, adventurer.
    Why don'taru you hang around and take on hard mode?${prompt}
  13260: |-
    You're on fire, adventurer!
    A red-hotaru display like that deserves a cool, cool prize. Here you go!${prompt}
  13261: Hey, did you see the show being held at town square?${prompt}
  13262: The sensational new starlet, Mumor, is performing! You have to go and cheer her on, kupo!${prompt}
  13263: The sensational new starlet, Uka, is performing! You have to go and cheer her on, kupo!${prompt}
  13264: |-
    Kupopo!?
    The bathing suit you're wearing...it's a prize from the show!${prompt}
  13265: |-
    Kupopo!?
    The yukata you're wearing...it's a prize from the show!${prompt}
  13266: |-
    Kupopo!?
    The happi you're wearing...it's a prize from the show!${prompt}
  13267: The outfit you're wearing...it's a prize from the show!${prompt}
  13268: Thank you so much for helping out our Mumor, kupo.${prompt}
  13269: Thank you so much for helping out our Uka, kupo.${prompt}
  13270: To show our appreciation, I'll warp you to one of the other nations, kupo! Where do you want to go?${prompt}
  13271: |-
    Where will you go?
    ${selection-lines}
    Nowhere.
    San d'Oria.
    Bastok.
    Windurst.${prompt}
  13272: Enjoy your trip, kupo!${prompt}
  13273: |-
    Kupopo!?
    Is that a wind charm you have there?${prompt}
  13274: Looks like you've really gotten into the spirit of the Sunbreeze Festival, kupo!${prompt}
  13275: |-
    As a show of appreciation, I'll teleport you to one of the other nations!
    Tell me where you'd like to go, kupo.${prompt}
  13276: Greetings and well met! Guardian of the Kingdom, Alaune, at your most humble service.${prompt}
  13277: Greetings and well met! Defender of the Republic, Gulldago, at your most humble service.${prompt}
  13278: Greetings and well met! Protector of the Federation, Selele, at your most humble service.${prompt}
  13279: |-
    My station is to help along those new to the life of an adventurer in Vana'diel.
    I specialize in the types of fundamental knowledge necessary for success in such endeavors, as well as related methods of pedagogy.
    With my aid, you can rest assured that your first steps down the adventurer's path will not go astray.${prompt}
  13280: Should you still consider yourself a newcomer, I would highly recommend that you make full use of my services.${prompt}
  13281: |-
    This is my permanent post, and I never leave it. Remember it well.
    Whenever you need a hand with anything, anything at all, don't hesitate to come calling.${prompt}
  13282: |-
    So, are you interested in some entry-level duties to put you well on your way to greatness?
    Not to worry, I've got just the thing for you!${prompt}
  13283: Go talk to the guard Aravoge just over yonder and have him cast “Signet” on you. Then come back and see me.${prompt}
  13284: Go talk to the guard Rabid Wolf over yonder and have him cast “Signet” on you. Then come back and see me.${prompt}
  13285: Go talk to the guard Harara over yonder and have her cast “Signet” on you. Then come back and see me.${prompt}
  13286: Well, it looks like you were able to get your Signet. Easy enough, yes?${prompt}
  13287: |-
    As long as Signet is in effect, there is always a possibility that you will obtain crystals from any enemies that you defeat.
    There are also other more concrete benefits, such as increased defense and evasion.${prompt}
  13288: |-
    Signet even helps you when not engaged in combat with an enemy. For example, it boosts the rate at which healing occurs while at rest.
    For all of these reasons and more, you should consider it essential to have Signet cast on you at all times.${prompt}
  13289: 'Very well, then! As a reward for successful completion of your first assignment I would like to present you with these ${item-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  13290: |-
    There is more here than “meats” the eye! That was a joke...
    Anyway, this is a type of item known amongst adventurers as a “meal.”
    This meal in particular will temporarily enhance your attack power when eaten.${prompt}
  13291: |-
    Whenever any type of meal is consumed, you will receive some such temporary status bonus.
    Naturally, different meals grant different types of bonuses.${prompt}
  13292: |-
    For the most part, meat dishes will affect attack power.
    Conversely, seafood dishes generally enhance defense, and so on and so forth.
    Take care to select dishes best suited to your purpose.${prompt}
  13293: |-
    One thing you should make note of, however, is that you cannot eat a meal while another meal's status bonus is still in effect.
    Your stomach would simply burst!${prompt}
  13294: |-
    Hmmm, that's quite a lot to cover...
    Are you with me so far?${prompt}
  13295: |-
    So far so good?
    ${selection-lines}
    Explain Signet again.
    Explain meals again.
    This is a breeze.${prompt}
  13296: |-
    Great! Well, talking can only prepare you so much. Let's get right down to it.
    Go ahead and pop one of those ${item-plural: 0[2]}!${prompt}
  13297: |-
    After eating a meal, a status icon designated as “Food” will appear in the upper-left portion of your screen.
    Come back and talk to me again once you've confirmed that it's there.${prompt}
  13298: |-
    Check out the full belly on you! Well done!
    Signet and meals can both play crucial roles whenever you take on any type of enemy.
    This is a key lesson that you would do well not to forget!${prompt}
  13299: |-
    Next, let's get those pristine hands of yours nice and dirty!
    No sense in letting that food go to waste now, is there? Let's send you out to fight a monster on a full stomach!${prompt}
  13300: Exiting through that gate over there will lead you into an area with hostile enemies.${prompt}
  13301: |-
    Try to target one of the monsters and then select the “Check” option from your menu.
    This will help you ascertain an enemy's level of difficulty and make sure they are not too strong. A smart adventurer picks ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] fights.${prompt}
  13302: Be warned. Engaging any enemy that checks as “very tough” or above will result in your Signet not granting you the defense and evasion bonuses you would otherwise receive.${prompt}
  13303: And that brings us to your next assignment!${prompt}
  13304: It's high time you learned how to use a “weapon skill”!${prompt}
  13305: Perhaps you've already noticed, but sometimes while fighting an enemy, your “skills” will rise little by little.${prompt}
  13306: When your skill with the weapon you are wielding reaches a predetermined value, weapon skills will become available for use.${prompt}
  13307: |-
    “Combo” for those adept with hand-to-hand weapons. “Wasp Sting” for those who fight with daggers.
    “Fast Blade” for those who prefer the sword.${prompt}
  13308: |-
    “Shining Strike” for wielders of the club. “Heavy Swing” for those who take up the staff.
    And on, and on, and on...${prompt}
  13309: |-
    Selecting “Status” from the main menu will bring up the “Combat Skl.” option.
    This will display all of the current skill values in all weapon categories.${prompt}
  13310: |-
    The first weapon skill for each weapon type can be learned at a skill value of 5.
    So make that your first goal, and we'll take it from there!${prompt}
  13311: |-
    Ohhh! Somebody went and learned a new weapon skill, didn't ${choice-player-gender}[he/she]?
    Very good!${prompt}
  13312: |-
    I can see by that twinkle in your eyes that you've already used it on some poor, unfortunate creature, but I'll explain just a bit more.
    Whenever your “Tactical Points” (TP) reach 1000 or more, selecting “Abilities” and then “Weapon Skl.” from the menu will display a list of usable weapon skills.${prompt}
  13313: |-
    These are deadly techniques capable of rendering massive damage on enemies.
    It is well worth an adventurer's time to learn and master them.${prompt}
  13314: Ah, by the way, were you fortunate enough to receive some items from the monsters you fought?${prompt}
  13315: |-
    If you were lucky enough to come across any ${item-plural: 0[2]}, make sure you hang onto them.
    They may pay dividends later on...${prompt}
  13316: |-
    Also, that reminds me. There is another lesson better learned sooner than later.
    The items you will no doubt come across known as “crystals,” such as ${item-plural: 1[2]} and ${item-plural: 2[2]}, are extremely significant.${prompt}
  13317: |-
    They are truly versatile items that can be used for a number of purposes.
    These include trading them to guards for certain rewards, and selling them to earn money, just to name a few.${prompt}
  13318: For now, I'd like to explain more about another of their uses. Namely, the role they play in “synthesis.”${prompt}
  13319: |-
    But first things first. Your reward for completing your last assignment! Here you are, then.
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and last but not least, ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}
  13320: |-
    Now, using ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} will bring up the synthesis interface.
    Once there, select the ${item-singular: 1[2]} and ${item-singular: 2[2]} as the ingredients to be added.${prompt}
  13321: All that remains is to select the “OK” option, and the synthesis will commence!${prompt}
  13322: |-
    You'll find that the crafting process will never begin, should the ingredients you've selected not form a viable synthesis recipe.
    Also, even when your materials are correct, there is always a chance that your synthesis will fail, so please be wary.${prompt}
  13323: The majority of items which you create via synthesis, as well as most of those dropped by enemies you defeat, can be placed on the “Auction House” for sale.${prompt}
  13324: The auction house is an ultra-consumer venue where you can attempt to purchase the wares of other players by placing bids, as well as have other players bid on items you have put up for sale.${prompt}
  13325: |-
    My words alone can do no justice to the vast cornucopia of goods that is the auction house.
    One simply must see it with one's own eyes.${prompt}
  13326: |-
    Are you still with me?
    ${selection-lines}
    Explain synthesis again.
    Explain the auction house again.
    Sure am.${prompt}
  13327: Somewhere in this great city lies our nation's auction house. Seek it out, and report back to me when you have found it.${prompt}
  13328: |-
    You needn't worry about going through with an actual purchase.
    Simply examining any of the “Auction Counters” will more than suffice.${prompt}
  13329: |-
    So, you were able to locate the auction house!
    Pretty hard to miss, isn't it?${prompt}
  13330: |-
    What do you think? It is as I said, yes? Few organizations in this world exceed the auction house in scale.
    It will never cease to be of use to you throughout your adventures. It would be wise to become adept at using it.${prompt}
  13331: |-
    And now down to brass tacks!
    Let's see if we can't get you to up some levels!${prompt}
  13332: There are several items in existence which serve to enhance the number of experience points you receive for defeating enemies.${prompt}
  13333: 'For example, there are ${item-plural: 0[2]}, ${item-plural: 1[2]}, and ${item-plural: 2[2]}, just to name a few.${prompt}'
  13334: These are a bit unique in that you must wait a certain amount of time after equipping them before you may use them.${prompt}
  13335: |-
    There is also a predetermined amount of time, usually quite long, that must pass before these items can be used again.
    The total number of times you may use any single item is also limited, so be mindful of that as well.${prompt}
  13336: |-
    Many of these items may be obtained from the same guards that provide you with Signet.
    You need only exchange “Conquest Points” in order to acquire them.${prompt}
  13337: |-
    As a matter of fact, for finishing that last assignment, I'm going to give you this ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.
    With this, you'll be able to obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} without having to use any of your Conquest Points.${prompt}
  13338: |-
    Head over to any guard and have a go at exchanging them for something.
    And after that, see if you can't make it all the way up to level four.
    I'll be right here waiting for you when you get back.${prompt}
  13339: |-
    With an experience bonus in place, it should take you practically no time at all.
    Good luck, and be careful! It can get quite hairy out there!${prompt}
  13340: |-
    Well, well, well! We might make an adventurer out of you just yet!
    Looks like we've almost washed all that green off of you.${prompt}
  13341: |-
    A bit of bad news now, though.
    Starting from level 31, anytime you are knocked unconscious your experience points will suffer a deduction.${prompt}
  13342: |-
    As a general rule, the amount penalized will be about 10% of the total amount required to reach the next level.
    You have to be more careful than ever from here on out!${prompt}
  13343: However, there are ways to minimize this loss of experience points.${prompt}
  13344: |-
    Like this, for example. Go on, take it. Your reward for reaching level four.
    It's called ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  13345: |-
    Using this will grant you a status known as “Reraise.”
    Whenever you are rendered unconscious while this effect is in place, you will have the option to revive yourself.${prompt}
  13346: |-
    Choosing to do so will cause you to be resuscitated in the very spot where you have fallen.
    In addition, as I stated previously, the amount of experience points you lose will be somewhat lessened.${prompt}
  13347: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} and similar items work in the same manner as the ${item-plural: 1[2]} and the other experience bonus items I mentioned earlier.
    That is, once equipped, you must wait a certain period of time before they can be used, and there are both cooldown timers and limited charges as well.${prompt}
  13348: |-
    All of these items as a whole are collectively referred to as “enchanted items.”
    There is a vast array of other enchanted items with myriad other effects that will prove useful on your adventures.
    It may be worth the time and effort to better acquaint yourself with them at some point.${prompt}
  13349: |-
    It seems you're starting to get the hang of things.
    Next, I'd like for you to go and fight some enemies in ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon].${prompt}
  13350: '${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/The Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] is located beyond the ${choice: 2}[southern/northern/northern] reaches of ${choice: 2}[West Ronfaure/North Gustaberg/East Sarutabaruta].${prompt}'
  13351: |-
    You're sure to encounter some new monsters there that you won't find prowling around the outskirts of the city.
    It may be a bit daunting, so I'll only require that you slay one such beast, and then head on back.${prompt}
  13352: |-
    Just keep in mind, the farther you stray from the city, the more ferocious monsters tend to be.
    Don't say I didn't warn you.${prompt}
  13353: |-
    Make sure to use the “Check” command to determine the strength of your enemy.
    If you find that you are surrounded by enemies too difficult for you, try heading back to a previous area closer to the city and leveling up a bit more first.${prompt}
  13354: |-
    I know those smells...
    You smell of victory! And of ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon]! Good on you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13355: But by now you must be getting sick and tired of fighting the same old monsters so close to the city walls, aren't you?${prompt}
  13356: If you are several levels beyond a monster and totally outclass them in every respect, checking them will yield a “too weak to be worthwhile” result.${prompt}
  13357: Killing monsters so far beneath you is borderline cowardice, and will net you no experience points.${prompt}
  13358: If you start to notice more and more of these “too weak” monsters around you, consider moving farther from the city to a more difficult area.${prompt}
  13359: |-
    Congratulations on another milestone! Reward tiiime!
    You've just earned yourself ${number: 0} experience points, hotshot.${prompt}
  13360: Let's dive right into your next assignment while that blood is still pumping!${prompt}
  13361: |-
    I'm going to up the stakes here a little bit, ${name-player}. But it's for your own good.
    I want you to go out and get all the way to level ten.${prompt}
  13362: |-
    Considering your current level and the knowledge you have, you shouldn't confine yourself to the immediate vicinity of the city.
    You're more than capable of besting monsters in ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] at this point.${prompt}
  13363: |-
    I knew you wouldn't disappoint me. So how's it feel? You're moving on up in the world.
    Time to put some money in those pockets. A ${number: 1}-gil reward, just for you. Don't spend it all in one place.${prompt}
  13364: By now you should be relatively familiar with the basics of battle. Am I right or am I right?${prompt}
  13365: |-
    But don't go getting too cocky!
    This world is chock-full of monsters just waiting for the opportune moment to pounce and knock you out cold!${prompt}
  13366: |-
    Depending on the type of monster, there are several factors that could cause them to attack you without provocation.
    I'll enumerate some of the more common types of this blatantly aggressive behavior for you.${prompt}
  13367: For starters, and most obviously, there are monsters which detect by sight. They will attack you whenever you enter their field of vision. This is the most prevalent type. They simply cannot stand the sight of adventurers.${prompt}
  13368: |-
    Next, there are those monsters which detect by sound. They can be a bit more dangerous than visually-dependent monsters, in that they will attack the source of any sound within a certain prescribed radius.
    You may not think it, but there are a great many monsters whose aural senses are far more developed than their sense of sight.${prompt}
  13369: |-
    There are also monsters which detect their enemies' spellcasting. Much like the sound-detecting types, these monsters will attack the source of any magic casting within a certain radius of their being.
    Not surprisingly, many monsters in the arcana family rely heavily on this method of detection, which covers a comparatively larger range than the aforementioned sense of hearing.${prompt}
  13370: |-
    And finally, there are opportunistic monsters which prey upon the weak and near-dead, pinpointing their prey by detecting low hit points.
    The family of undead creatures abound in monsters of this type. Even more distressing, the fewer the hit points you have, the farther the distance from which you can be detected.${prompt}
  13371: Your next assignment will attempt to familiarize you with these detection methods, and train you to become adept at avoiding them.${prompt}
  13372: 'I want you to travel once again to ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], and retrieve an item known as a “Gate Crystal.”${prompt}'
  13373: 'Near the center of ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], you will find a large, white, almost otherworldly structure. On the area map, it is labeled as the ${choice: 2}[Crag of Holla/Crag of Dem/Crag of Mea].${prompt}'
  13374: |-
    There you will find one of an enormous series of crystals known as “Telepoints.”
    Simply examine the telepoint you find there, and bring back your findings.${prompt}
  13375: 'Only when you present your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to me shall your assignment be complete.${prompt}'
  13376: |-
    Exercise the utmost caution. There are many extremely dangerous monsters in the area you will be visiting.
    And take extra care not to draw the attention of any beastmen.${prompt}
  13377: |-
    This shall be your final assignment.
    Go now, and may the Goddess watch over you.${prompt}
  13378: |-
    Ahhh, the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, just as I requested.
    Excellent work, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13379: |-
    And now for some information regarding this little beauty.
    As long as you have this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, you will be able to be transported by the appropriate spell of teleportation directly to the telepoint from which you retrieved it.${prompt}
  13380: I doubt that you will have many opportunities to use it for the time being, but you would do well to remember what I have said.${prompt}
  13381: |-
    Several such telepoints exist, scattered throughout Vana'diel.
    Each has its own specific gate crystal, which you will receive the first time that you examine any of them.${prompt}
  13382: |-
    Let me take this time to offer you a most heartfelt congratulations, ${name-player}!
    You have successfully completed all of the assignments I have laid before you.${prompt}
  13383: 'And here I have a most fitting reward for you. A gift of ${number: 1} experience points, and ${number: 3} ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  13384: |-
    I fear that I have nothing more to teach you.
    From now on, your lessons will best be learned by giving a mindful ear to others and being ever observant on your travels.${prompt}
  13385: Do remember, though, that the paths open before you will multiply greatly should you cooperate with other adventurers.${prompt}
  13386: |-
    Leveling, for example, is an endeavor made immeasurably more efficient and enjoyable in the company of others.
    It helps to not only guarantee you some modicum of safety in numbers, but also rewards you with considerably more experience points than adventuring alone.${prompt}
  13387: |-
    I suppose it does require a good deal of courage to approach an adventurer you do not know, but I strongly encourage you to do so.
    It may prove to be the beginning of an extremely rewarding and long-lasting friendship.${prompt}
  13388: |-
    There may still be some small facets of adventuring that I can continue to offer you advice on.
    Should you ever have any questions or anxieties, please do not hesitate to come and see me again.
    I will do my best to be of service and set your heart at ease.${prompt}
  13389: Go now, and go well. The world awaits its next great adventurer, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13390: |-
    Good day to you! Guardian of the Kingdom, Alaune, at your most humble service.
    Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt}
  13391: |-
    Good day to you! Defender of the Republic, Gulldago, at your most humble service.
    Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt}
  13392: |-
    Good day to you! Protector of the Federation, Selele, at your most humble service..
    Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt}
  13393: |-
    What will you ask about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Nothing just now.
    Search comments.
    Skillchains.
    Magic bursts.
    Skillchains and elements.${prompt}
  13394: Just as their name implies, search comments are original messages composed by adventurers which are readily visible to others when using the search function.${prompt}
  13395: |-
    There are several different categories of search comments.
    These include, but are not limited to, “EXP Party,” “Items,” and “Missions and Quests.”${prompt}
  13396: Opening the “Search” function from the Main Menu and then selecting the “Comment” option will allow you to conduct a player search by comment type.${prompt}
  13397: For example, if you would like to search for other players to form a leveling party, you need only select “EXP Party” from the list displayed.${prompt}
  13398: Conversely, if you would like to advertise yourself as interested in being on the receiving end of an experience party invite, you can choose the “Edit Comment” command from the Search menu.${prompt}
  13399: |-
    Of course, search comment composition differs from person to person.
    You might want to conduct a search first to see what type of search comments are considered the norm before writing your own.${prompt}
  13400: Skillchains are devastating elemental phenomena which manifest themselves when weapon skills are carried out in a precise and well-timed order. ${prompt}
  13401: The very natures of the skillchains themselves differ widely, being dependent upon the weapon skills used and the order of their execution.${prompt}
  13402: To take a simple and timeless example, using the weapon skill “Red Lotus Blade” immediately after “Fast Blade” will yield a type of skillchain known as “Liquefaction.”${prompt}
  13403: Furthermore, adding a “Combo” after the liquefaction effect will produce a more advanced “Fusion” skillchain.${prompt}
  13404: |-
    In the taxonomy of skillchains, each type is related to one or more specific elements.
    Liquefaction is bound to the element of fire, for example, and fusion to both fire and light.${prompt}
  13405: Another crucial point, which I simply cannot emphasize enough, is the importance of timing in the execution of skillchains.${prompt}
  13406: |-
    One must not be too overzealous, but too much patience can also be damning.
    It is most ideal to time the latter weapon skill to begin just a second or two after the preceding one is complete.${prompt}
  13407: |-
    The possible weapon skill sequences and the different skillchains they yield are highly variegated.
    It is said of this time-tested battle art that it “takes a moment to learn, and a lifetime to master.”${prompt}

    Magic bursts are another type of supernatural phenomena which occur after carefully selected and impeccably timed spells are cast following a skillchain. Such spells exceed their typical counterparts in that they are enhanced in both power and accuracy.
    You will commonly see magic bursts abbreviated as “MB.”${prompt}
  13409: Magic bursts will not take place if the element of the spell being cast does not match the element of the skillchain preceding it.${prompt}
  13410: To take an example, a detonation skillchain, which has wind as its element, followed by an aero or other like spell, will generate a magic burst.${prompt}
  13411: In the same vein, thunder, or any cognate spell, would result in a magic burst should it follow an impaction skillchain, itself deriving power from that very element.${prompt}
  13412: As I said previously, some skillchains are associated with more than one element. Take fragmentation, for example. It is composed of equal parts wind and thunder. So chasing a fragmentation skillchain with any type of aero or thunder spell would create a magic burst.${prompt}
  13413: The key to mastering magic bursts lies in learning the elemental attributes of both the skillchains you create as well as the magic you wield. The rest is simply a matter of timing.${prompt}
  13414: For your convenience, I will go over the elemental attributes of all skillchain types. Pay close attention.${prompt}

    Level 1 Skillchain (Associated element):

  13978: Trust is a new type of magic inventarued by the Jeuno Institute for Magical Studies and unveiled at our recent international symposium.${prompt}
  13979: As any Aurastery student could tell you, most magic taps into the aetheric energies of the caster, draining them. “Trust,” however, relies on the spiritual energy which develops between two souls bound closely by love and friendship.${prompt}
  13980: That means you can use it regardless of your job-wob! Isn't that almost as fantastic as my hairstyle?${prompt}
  13981: There's one small caveataru--you should never use this magic within city walls. Regulations and all.${prompt}
  13982: Using Trust magic brings out an alter ego of someone who you have a special-wecial relationship with.${prompt}
  13983: However, no matter how powerful-wowerful your friends are, when you call forth their alter ego, it will only be as strong as you. ${prompt}
  13984: You must surely be fascinated with all this, thanks to my clear-cut explanation. You want to know what's even more fascinating? That the alter ego will fightaru alongside you!${prompt}
  13985: Of course, you won't be able to give the alter ego you summon specific instructions-wuctions. This is your friend we're talking about; you don't go barking orders at friends, right?${prompt}
  13986: So if the alter ego you summon runs off and gets into trouble, don't get too mad, okay?${prompt}
  13987: To send alter egos back from whence they came, simply tell them so. They'll probably be happy to take a little break-weak.${prompt}
  13988: If its life force runs out, it will retreataru into the aether and vanish from this realm. But fear not--you'll be able to call it back into our world after a certain amount of time has passed.${prompt}
  13989: Trust magic is based in the emotions of trustaru, friendship, and ${choice-player-gender}[brotherly/sisterly] love, so you can't summon just anyone. Take me, for example--I'm far too adorable and busy for you to call forth whenever you want.${prompt}
  13990: But there are others willing to help you. Those participating in the Trust initiative may be able to help you if you take the time to chataru with them.${prompt}
  13991: The strength of the bonds you have with them--if any--determine if the magic-wagic will succeed or fail.${prompt}
  13992: If it fails, then you may need to adventure more and make a name for yourself, as I have. Or maybe you need to help solve some problem-woblem they have. It depends!${prompt}

  14025: Regardless of her true name, I still refer to her as “Shikaree Z” out of respect and a sense of grrratitude.${prompt}
  14026: 'She ${choice: 2}[was/is] a sin hunter through and through. As a bearer of the fang, she ${choice: 2}[submits/submitted] herrrself wholly to the laws of nature.${prompt}'

    Tell me, how've you been treating yourself?${prompt}
  14030: I told you where I was going before I left, didn't I?${prompt}
  14031: Upon returning to the motherland, I confessed everything to the queen.${prompt}
  14032: I've never been good with words, so I spoke from the heart, telling her exactly what transpired.${prompt}
  14033: When faced with the Emptiness, I fought, proving what true justice is.${prompt}
  14034: I stopped being a sin hunter, but continued mentoring my younger sisters...and have traveled throughout Vana'diel.${prompt}
  14035: But there is one thing that piqued my interest...${prompt}
  14036: 'I see you have ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  14037: 'I${choice: 2}[/, too,] have come to speak with Perih Vashai about that very matter.${prompt}'

  14039: 'I am not blind. ${choice: 2}[My skills as a sin hunter are/My prowess is] needed by many.${prompt}'
  14040: But who can ensure that my alter ego will not be a sin in and of itself?${prompt}
  14041: The motherland's leaders are in constant debate about what this new magic can mean for our people.${prompt}
  14042: Does it abide by the natural order of things?${prompt}
  14043: If the alter ego causes a sin, then who is the hunter supposed to track down?${prompt}
  14044: Of course, the queen's stance on these issues is as fickle as a newborn babe.${prompt}
  14045: But the prevailing opinion is that Trust magic is permissible so long as it does not violate the natural order and is undertaken by one who is not apt to cause sin.${prompt}
  14046: 'As such, I received a scroll, and am tasked with finding someone from among ${choice: 2}[us/the] sin hunters to engage in the ritual.${prompt}'
  14047: Who could possibly be more trustworthy than Perih Vashai? I am here today to give the scroll to her.${prompt}
  14048: The reason the scroll found its way to me is because I managed to convince Shikaree Y that Perih Vashai would be more worthy than anyone else.${prompt}
  14049: She knows how to respect the laws of nature, and is as unlikely a person to sin as anyone I know.${prompt}
  14050: Yet for some reason, she refused.${prompt}
  14051: “The natural way of things is not for us to decide. The sky and land have that responsibility.”${prompt}
  14052: So she elected to wait until she received a sign from above.${prompt}
  14053: Hmm?${prompt}
  14054: What is this smell...?${prompt}
  14055: It smells of change, carried by the western wind. Is something about to...?${prompt}

  14060: No, I do not--cannot--forget where we first fought, and where I first fell.${prompt}
  14061: You went from being a passerby on my life's road to something much greater.${prompt}
  14062: My sisters set the wheel in motion, but it was I who issued the challenge--and you accepted.${prompt}
  14063: You spurred them on to learn the intricacies of the delta attack.${prompt}
  14064: And there are other scents, too--I picture an open expanse of saltwater with each breath I take. It reminds me of Bibiki Bay.${prompt}
  14065: 'Our fights and struggles were noble. We aimed to protect all we held dear: trust, justice, courage, and hope.${prompt}'
  14066: Are these not the qualities required by the Trust ritual? If they are, then we shall surely be successful.${prompt}
  14067: '${choice: 4}[There is yet another./And there are other scents, too.] The fragrance peculiar to Mhaura''s port.${prompt}'
  14068: My journeys with you taught me about the unspoken rules of the land, and I learned of the place my mother's words were meant to guide me to.${prompt}
  14069: If my alter ego can help you, then it is not for me to question whether or not the process itself is a sin.${prompt}
  14070: And yet there's more.${prompt}
  14071: I can taste the fear that I felt when I confessed my true desires to my sisters.${prompt}
  14072: I was afraid when I opened up to them because they might not accept what I had to say.${prompt}
  14073: '...But I know they have changed since they first met you.${prompt}'
  14074: There is also the trace of my sisters carried upon the wind. I have never thanked you for aiding them in their endeavors.${prompt}
  14075: Thank you for helping Shikaree X with her first survey in Tavnazia.${prompt}
  14076: Shikaree X told me the reason she was able to speak like a true sin hunter was that you stood by her side. ${prompt}
  14077: Shikaree Y mentioned that you hurried after her when she took a tuning fork in hand and made for Uleguerand Range.${prompt}
  14078: You know how lightly she always dresses. I would have been worried, too.${prompt}
  14079: The pristine scents from the sky now tell me of another, beautiful time.${prompt}
  14080: The sweet sensation of victory when we vanquished the Keeper of the Apocalypse.${prompt}
  14081: 'Ahhh, what I wouldn''t give for us to gather again, exchanging tales over some ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  14082: ${name-player}, can you not hear the voice of nature?${prompt}
  14083: '...I can hear it speaking to me. It bids me accompany you once more.${prompt}'

  14203: Of course, injecting your own personal flavor may act as a conversation starter and help people to remember you.${prompt}
  14204: No matter which route you choose, make sure to always remain polite. There is no better way to start a friendship off on the right foot.${prompt}
  14205: When speaking with others, it's critical to listen and be mindful of what they say.${prompt}
  14206: Always talking and never listening may come across as rude.${prompt}
  14207: Another important point is to always be mindful of the listener. How would you feel if someone said that to you? Think carefully before sending someone a message.${prompt}
  14208: It also helps to be clear and concise.${prompt}
  14209: Being vague might cause others to get the wrong impression.${prompt}

  14222: Never once have I forgotten your dedication to protecting all of San d'Oria.${prompt}
  14223: As you are doubtlessly aware, a short time ago I received a memorandum from the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network detailing Unity Concord and requesting my services as a Unity leader.${prompt}
  14224: Tell me. Is there any greater way for a prince regent to earn honor for his kingdom than by spearheading a group dedicated to purging evil from the land?${prompt}
  14225: Many around me were opposed, but that bothered me not. My brother, Trion, serves as a representative of the Trust initiative, and it falls to me to up the ante.${prompt}
  14226: I cannot lie. That was an important factor in my decision.${prompt}
  14227: But be not concerned with our internal squabbles. Know only that it pleases me to welcome you to my Unity.${prompt}

  14230: Do not think me ungrateful. No, I am always pleased to have your help, but this time things are a bit different.${prompt}
  14231: Do not think me ungrateful. You strengthened the Mythril Musketeers in ways I never thought possible, and we are closer than ever before.${prompt}
  14232: Not terribly long ago I was contacted by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, which asked that I head a Unity.${prompt}
  14233: At first I was flustered and thought of turning the offer down. Why would they pick me when there are others more qualified?${prompt}
  14234: But Volker decided it would be the perfect opportunity for me to develop my leadership skills, and told them I would accept...without my knowledge.${prompt}

  14415: Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.${prompt}
  14416: Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.${prompt}
  14417: “Unity” is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.${prompt}
  14418: Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.${prompt}
  14419: 'Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as “${keyitem-plural: 1[2]}.”${prompt}'
  14420: Chat settings may be changed by selecting “Status” from the main menu, and choosing “Unity Info” under the “Unity” submenu.${prompt}
  14421: You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.${prompt}
  14422: Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.${prompt}
  14423: The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.${prompt}
  14424: Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).${prompt}
  14425: Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.${prompt}
  14426: “Wanted” objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.${prompt}
  14427: These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as “Unity accolades” to undertake.${prompt}
  14428: Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.${prompt}
  14429: Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.${prompt}
  14430: The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.${prompt}
  14431: A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.${prompt}
  14432: Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.${prompt}
  14433: Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.${prompt}
  14434: When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.${prompt}
  14435: Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  14436: No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.${prompt}
  14437: You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.${prompt}
  14438: An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.${prompt}
  14439: One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.${prompt}
  14440: A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.${prompt}
  14441: Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  14442: These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.${prompt}
  14443: Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.${prompt}
  14444: You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.${prompt}
  14445: This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.${prompt}
  14446: This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.${prompt}
  14447: However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.${prompt}
  14448: Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.${prompt}
  14449: The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.${prompt}
  14450: Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.${prompt}
  14451: Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.${prompt}
  14452: On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.${prompt}
  14453: 'Additionally, an individual''s evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by ${number: 0}. A Unity''s ranking is the average of all eligible members'' individual evaluations.${prompt}'
  14454: The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.${prompt}
  14455: Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.${prompt}
  14456: 'Those with evaluations of ${number: 0} or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.${prompt}'
  14457: Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.${prompt}
  14458: A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.${prompt}
  14459: Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.${prompt}
  14460: A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.${prompt}
  14461: It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.${prompt}

  14814: Oh! I see you must have had a meeting-weeting with her already.${prompt}
  14815: Yes, I have heard all aboutaru it. It is a shield that can increase one's crafting abilities. I was quite surprised when I heard the story.${prompt}
  14816: If that story is for real-weal, then I definitely would like to see it for myself.${prompt}
  14817: I know all about your talentaru, and if she chose you too, it must mean you have the qualifications necessary to make the shield.${prompt}
  14818: Now, allow me to teach you the recipe-wecipe.${prompt}
  14819: 'So, with this particular ingredientaru list, you first need to obtain ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  14820: 'This item is needed to boostaru the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its full potential.${prompt}'
  14821: I actually received some notes on the topic-wopic of Craftsmanship. Please bear with me while I go over them.${prompt}
  14822: 'You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} equipped.${prompt}'
  14823: Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you run into trouble.${prompt}
  14824: In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.${prompt}
  14825: You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...${prompt}
  14826: So, did you find that little tidbitaru of information useful?${prompt}
  14827: 'Once the Craftsmanship is high enough, come to me and I will make you the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  14828: 'After that, you''ll need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} nextaru, which you can obtain from Julissois.${prompt}'
  14829: I assume you are no stranger-wranger to making deliveries. That is basically how you will get the ingredients you need.${prompt}
  14830: You can speak with Julissois for more information.${prompt}
  14831: That covers the ingredient listaru. Please bring the shield by once you have made the upgrade. I'm curious to see it for myself.${prompt}
  14832: Hm? You say you forgotaru the recipe already? Wait just a moment and I will get you the list again. Professional craftsmen really need to remember these kinds of things.${prompt}
  14833: You have worked hard to master your craftaru. I have faith that you can handle this.${prompt}
  14834: 'I see... That''s the ticketaru. I should be able to use this to make the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  14835: 'This mustaru be the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  14836: I am not sure how the whole thing works, but it is amazing to think that I can pour my soul-woul into this shield somehow.${prompt}
  14837: 'Oh, it seems that when the ${item-singular: 0[2]} was wroughtaru, it somehow reduced the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  14838: 'That is not a problem if you wantaru to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but if you need to make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you would need to increase the Craftsmanship again.${prompt}'
  14839: Of course, you're not the type to lose something so valuable-waluable and need to replace it.${prompt}
  14840: 'Impossible. You mean to tell me that you actually lostaru the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  14841: 'Well, I suppose these things happen-wappen. I''ll make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}, so please let me borrow your shield.${prompt}'
  14842: You are a professional craftsman. As such, it should not be so difficultaru to take care of your ingredients.${prompt}
  14843: It appears you made the upgrade without incidentaru. Do you mind if I take a look?${prompt}
  14844: Oh... I can see that it has changed, and it is giving off a faintaru energy. However, you can tell that it is not complete yet.${prompt}
  14845: No, you must craft it multiple-wultiple times in order to achieve the level you seek. That is what she told me anyway.${prompt}
  14846: That reminds me... She asked for some kind of sign after the shield is complete. Please give me a momentaru.${prompt}
  14847: That should do it.${prompt}
  14848: Now, take this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno and everything will be perfectaru.${prompt}
  14849: Oh, justaru one more thing. I often have deliveries for Julissois, and would appreciate it if you could help me train the younger members of the guild.${prompt}
  14850: Welcome. Our mutual friend told me you would be paying me a visitaru.${prompt}
  14851: You're here to upgrade your shield, right? Firstaru, you'll need to learn the recipe.${prompt}
  14852: You're awfully quietaru. Did you get that?${prompt}
  14853: 'As for the listaru of ingredients, the first thing you''ll need is the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  14854: 'You''ll need to equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} while you craftaru until you boost its Craftsmanship to 100%.${prompt}'
  14855: Do you remember equipping the aspis while you were crafting before? This is basically the same conceptaru.${prompt}
  14856: 'Once it reaches 100%, bring it to me so I can inspectaru it and make the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  14857: 'Next is the ${item-singular: 2[2]} and the ${item-singular: 3[2]}. You are familiar with the ${item-singular: 3[2]} from before. You can requestaru both of them from Julissois.${prompt}'
  14858: 'The lastaru thing you''ll need is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}. Together with the A.M.A.N., I''ve prepared some Records of Eminence objectives for you.${prompt}'
  14859: 'You can refer to the Records of Eminence menu for additional information. Once you complete all of them, you will receive a perfectaru ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt}'
  14860: That concludes my explanation on the ingredients. You are a person of great talentaru. I know you'll do an excellent job.${prompt}
  14861: Oh, it looks like you've given a nice boostaru to the shield's Craftsmanship.${prompt}
  14862: 'Now, please waitaru while I make the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt}'
  14863: Okay, here you go.${prompt}
  14864: 'Ahh, it''s just as I thoughtaru. Making the ${item-singular: 0[2]} caused the shield''s Craftsmanship to decrease.${prompt}'
  14865: 'Therefore, make sure you take good care of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} so you don''t have to craftaru it multiple times.${prompt}'
  14866: My my! I'm not usually one to make shields, but even I can tell this one is of high quality! You truly are an expertaru craftsman!${prompt}
  14867: Indeed, I can sense greataru power coming from it compared to the last one you made.${prompt}
  14868: Now, before I forgetaru, allow me to mark the shield so you can take it back to her.${prompt}
  14869: There, all finished. Take this shield to Mewk Chorosap and you'll be set.${prompt}
  14870: This kind of thing happens to all of us. You can have another try at the final objective, so make sure you get it rightaru this time.${prompt}
  14871: Well, well, look who's chomping at the bitaru. Let's get down to business, then.${prompt}
  14872: Ah, so you know the recipe already? Then I'll share with you something you might not know.${prompt}
  14873: 'It''s about how to get ${item-plural: 4[2]} and ${item-plural: 5[2]}.${prompt}'
  14874: You've got to take orders-worders from the guild and bring them to the person who placed them.${prompt}
  14875: Not only do they have an eye for quality, but they want to see the artisan at work up close.${prompt}
  14876: For the most part, they'll only acceptaru items that you made right at their side.${prompt}
  14877: And you will have to procure the materials yourself. I presume this doesn't pose a problem?${prompt}
  14878: The good news is that some products have been made available at other guilds.${prompt}

  14913: 'I heard that Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno requires the ${item-singular: 0[2]} when it''s finished-winished. Please try not to lose it.${prompt}'
  14914: Ahh, welcome. Can I help you with something-womething?${prompt}
  14915: I see... The item you're looking for was a special requestaru made by a Tarutaru from Adoulin.${prompt}
  14916: We have a rather difficultaru situation here. I already sent it to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno.${prompt}
  14917: Therefore, I suppose you should visitaru Jeuno once again and see if it has been delivered.${prompt}
  14918: Ah, you came at just the rightaru time. I found that item you were looking for stuck in my loom.${prompt}
  14919: Hm? You need this thing? Yes, it was for you all along, so I don't see any problem-wroblem with you taking it.${prompt}
  14920: Ahh, welcome. This must be it...${prompt}

  14927: Hmm... I see you've spoken with her. Like me, you're quite currrious about things.${prompt}

  14931: Listen up now. I'm going to teach you the rrrecipe, so pay attention.${prompt}
  14932: 'So, firrrst, you''ll need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to get started.${prompt}'

  14944: 'So, this is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  14945: The technique to imbue a craftsman's soul into the shield to form a crystal... It makes no sense to me, but I can definitely feel its power.${prompt}
  14946: 'Hmm... It appears that by creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, it also reduced the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  14947: 'That''s fine if you only need to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but you''ll have to raise the Craftsmanship if you want to make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  14948: Of course, it's not like you'd ever need to do such a thing. Not someone as rrresponsible as you.${prompt}
  14949: 'I don''t believe it... You''rrre telling me that you lost the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  14950: 'Oh well. These things happen I guess. Let me see the shield. I''ll crrraft you another ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  14951: You're an elite craftsman now. You need to take better care of your ingrrredients or you'll never get any work.${prompt}
  14952: It seems you made the upgrrrade. Here, let me see how you did.${prompt}
  14953: Hmm... I can see the differrrence and feel its power, but it's clearly not finished yet.${prompt}
  14954: I'm sure she's already told you that you'll need to craft multiple times in order to achieve the expected rrresults.${prompt}
  14955: Oh yes... You need proof that the shield is complete. Wait just a moment and I'll get that rrready for you.${prompt}
  14956: That should do it.${prompt}
  14957: Simply show this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno and you'rrre all set.${prompt}
  14958: Oh, one more thing. I often have deliveries for Tergil. I hope you'll agrrree to help me train the newer guild members.${prompt}
  14959: Hello therrre. Yes, I've been expecting you after speaking with you know who.${prompt}
  14960: This is the recipe you'll need. Do try to rrremember it, will you?${prompt}
  14961: I hope you didn't forrrget that already.${prompt}
  14962: 'Now, let''s discuss how to obtain the ingredients. Firrrst, you''ll need to start with the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  14963: 'You used this before, no? Like with the aspis, you''ll need to crrraft while equipping the ${item-singular: 0[2]} in order to boost the shield''s Craftsmanship.${prompt}'
  14964: This time, though, you'll need to put in a little more effort.${prompt}
  14965: 'Once you have increased the Craftsmanship to its maximum level, come see me and I''ll crrreate the ${item-singular: 1[2]} for you.${prompt}'
  14966: 'Next, you need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. Do you remember the ${item-singular: 3[2]} frrrom before? I''ve given both of them to Tergil.${prompt}'
  14967: 'Last is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}. With the help of the A.M.A.N., I''ve prrrepared some Records of Eminence objectives for you.${prompt}'
  14968: 'You can rrrefer to the Records of Eminence menu for more details. Once you''ve cleared them all, you''ll get the ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt}'
  14969: That's it. I know it's harrrd work gathering all of these ingredients, but you've been through worse, no? I know you'll be fine!${prompt}
  14970: Oh, it seems the shield's Craftsmanship has drrropped.${prompt}
  14971: 'Wait just a moment. I''ll have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you beforrre long.${prompt}'
  14972: Ahh, it turned out just perrrfectly.${prompt}
  14973: 'Ahh... It looks like crrreating the ${item-singular: 0[2]} has once again caused the shield''s Craftsmanship to drop.${prompt}'
  14974: It is no easy task to increase its Craftsmanship, so keep it in a safe place until you're rrready to use it, understood?${prompt}
  14975: 'Hah... Something about this shield is quite fascinating. Did you use ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or something?${prompt}'
  14976: Yes, I can sense the power of this new shield. It feels rrremarkably different from the previous one.${prompt}
  14977: Here, allow me to marrrk it for when you show it to her.${prompt}
  14978: Therrre you go. Take this shield to Mewk Chorosap to complete your task.${prompt}
  14979: This simply will not do. You'rrre going to need to face the final objective once again.${prompt}
  14980: You've done well. Now, let's go over the next rrrecipe.${prompt}
  14981: What's this? You alrrready know the recipe and how to obtain some of the ingredients? Well, this should go quickly then.${prompt}
  14982: 'That just leaves the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}. Very well then.${prompt}'
  14983: We have some customers coming to orrrder items from us, so I'm going to have you make the items near them and make the delivery.${prompt}
  14984: It seems many of our customers are quite knowledgeable about boneworking, so they want to see our craftsmen's work up close and perrrsonal.${prompt}
  14985: As such, only items made in front of the customer will be accepted, although there are some exceptions to this rrrule.${prompt}
  14986: Forrrgive me, but you'll need to gather the necessary materials to create the item yourself. Fortunately, it doesn't matter how you get them.${prompt}
  14987: By the way, we've reached an agrrreement with the other guilds to buy and sell items that aren't normally available, assuming you have the money.${prompt}
  14988: You can see the items available in this area by speaking to each guild's crafting set vendor. I suppose it'll prrrove quite useful for you.${prompt}
  14989: Although, note that each guild is free to set its own rrrules, so you may not always be able to get what you want.${prompt}
  14990: 'Once you complete all of the customer requests, I''ll give you the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]} as prrromised. Good luck out there.${prompt}'
  14991: 'This is the ${choice: 0}[first/next/last] request.${prompt}'
  14992: 'Make a deliverrry of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Silver Owl at the Tenshodo in ${unknown: 0x01053782EC8180}.${prompt}'
  14993: 'Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Crooked Arrow in ${unknown: 0x01053782F38180}. You can find him in frrront of the Auction House.${prompt}'
  14994: 'Make a deliverrry of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Silver Owl at the Tenshodo in ${unknown: 0x01053782EC8180}.${prompt}'
  14995: 'Make a deliverrry of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Pawkrix at Muckvix''s Junk Shop in ${unknown: 0x01053782F58180}.${prompt}'
  14996: Oh, this is an item that doesn't need to be crrrafted near the customer.${prompt}
  14997: Don't forrrget to report back to me once you finish the request.${prompt}
  14998: The current request you're worrrking on is...${prompt}
  14999: How is the request coming along? Everything is going accorrrding to schedule?${prompt}
  15000: |-
    Everything okay?
    ${selection-lines}
    Everything's great!
    It could be better...${prompt}
  15001: I know I can always count on you. Keep up the good work!${prompt}
  15002: Hm? What's the matter?! You don't sound very well at all... Are you surrre you're feeling okay? Do you want to give up?${prompt}
  15003: |-
    Will you see this through?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'll do my best.
    I've had enough.${prompt}
  15004: I see... I guess you have been working prrretty hard recently. Very well. I'll ask another craftsman to help me.${prompt}
  15005: Try not to push yourself too harrrd. Take a rest for now and I'll have another customer for you when you're ready.${prompt}
  15006: Hello. You look like you're feeling better. Indeed, you're not nearrrly as pale as you were before! Okay, let's get down to business, shall we?${prompt}
  15007: Ahh, it seems you've finished the deliverrry to our customer. Nice work!${prompt}
  15008: Yes, I see you've completed the final deliverrry. I knew I could count on you to get it done.${prompt}
  15009: 'Alright, here are the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and ${item-singular: 1[2]}, just like I promised.${prompt}'
  15010: While I'm sure you'd never lose something so prrrecious, you can use guild points to obtain them again if need be.${prompt}
  15011: I really have come to like this kind of work. It's quite rewarding to see your efforts come to frrruition.${prompt}
  15012: Look! The shield is complete!${prompt}
  15013: Yes, it really does have a nice feel to it! Your skill as a craftsman continues to grrrow without bounds!${prompt}
  15014: Accorrrding to her, the next upgrade should unlock the true power of the shield. I can't wait to see what it becomes!${prompt}
  15015: Oh, I almost forrrgot! I was thinking you could make use of this new crafting technique. Consider it my little gift to you. I hope you can get some use out of it.${prompt}
  15016: Hello there. I see you've rrreached the final upgrade!${prompt}
  15017: You will need to ask about the rrrecipe. All I can tell you is how to obtain the necessary materials.${prompt}
  15018: 'Let''s see... First, you''ll rrrequire ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}...${prompt}'
  15019: I've left them with my frrriend Tergil. You just need to exchange crafter points for them.${prompt}
  15020: 'Next is the ${item-singular: 1[2]}... I can produce it for you once your shield''s Craftsmanship rrreaches 100%. Just like before, basically.${prompt}'
  15021: That about covers the explanation. This being the final upgrade and all, I expected it to be more difficult, but it sounds prrretty much the same. Hopefully, there's nothing to trip you up out there.${prompt}
  15022: I believe Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno needs this. Be carrreful not to lose it on the way.${prompt}
  15023: Hello. Hm? What's wrrrong?${prompt}
  15024: I see... Yes, I rrreceived the order. I was told to put my very heart and soul into it, so I remember it clearly.${prompt}
  15025: Although, I just sent it off to Jeuno. I never hearrrd that you'd be by to pick it up. If only you'd told me sooner...${prompt}
  15026: Well, I'm sure it's already arrived by now. You should rrreturn to Jeuno and see if it's been delivered. It was addressed to Mewk Chorosap.${prompt}
  15027: Hey, you didn't happen to bring this from Jeuno, did you? This emblem that I worrrked so hard to make...${prompt}
  15028: Hm? You've been searching for this? I wonder how it got here... Perrrhaps it was a ghost? Here, hurry up and get it away from me.${prompt}
  15029: Wait a moment! This must be it! Let me examine it...${prompt}
  15030: I see... I see... This is quite impressive! Just when did you manage to learrrn such skill?${prompt}
  15031: Actually, now that I think about it... You walking around with this thing is the perrrfect way to spread the word about our guild!${prompt}
  15032: I'm glad you showed me this. Here, I have something for you. It will teach you a brrrand new crafting technique.${prompt}
  15033: Your growth rrreally is quite impressive. If I'm not careful, you're likely to replace me as guildmaster before I know it!${prompt}
  15034: '${color-alt: 121}You have entered the crafting target area.${prompt}'
  15035: '${color-alt: 121}Crafting the requested items in the current target area will count towards the number of items you are required to deliver them.${prompt}'
  15036: '${color-alt: 121}You have left the crafting target area.${prompt}'
  15037: '${color-alt: 121}${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} remaining.${prompt}'
  15038: 'You''re the one that''s going to make me the ${item-plural: 0[2]}, rightaru? I just need ${number: 1} more.${prompt}'
  15039: 'That''s greataru! Just what I need! Please bring me ${number: 1} more.${prompt}'
  15040: 'These''re greataru! Just what I need! Please bring me ${number: 1} more.${prompt}'
  15041: Excellentaru, my good friend! You really helped me out here! Thanks again.${prompt}
