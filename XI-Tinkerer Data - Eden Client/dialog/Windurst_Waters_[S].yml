    Here's a token for your troubles.
    You'll be wanting to takey-wake good care of it. Why, it's a Ponono original, after all!${prompt}
  7682: |-
    Normally, you'd see lines of customers stretchy-wetching halfway across Sarutabaruta just to buy one of these.
    But with times being what they are, I'm handing them out free of charge to brave souls like you who toil to protectaru the Federation from the beastman menace.
    Don't you feel lucky?${prompt}
  7683: |-
    Go on, take a closer look.
    Do you see the three threads so exquisitaruly entwined?
    Sometimes I can't help but admire my own crafty-waftsmanship!${prompt}
  7684: |-
    It's my family's technique, handed down from ages pastaru.
    And believe it or not, it's enchantarued as well! As each thread unravels, mystic powers will be bestowed upon its wearer.${prompt}
  7685: Hmm? What sortaru of powers, you ask?${prompt}
  7686: Well, the first string is said to bestow “courage to stand against the most fearsome plightaru.”${prompt}
  7687: The second, “gentleness to soothy-woothe the deepest wound.”${prompt}

    And the third... Well, you'll just have to see for yourself, won'taru you?

    In fact, I seem to have exhaustarued my entire stock! No, this simply won't do...${prompt}
  7691: |-
    I still have my spools of thread, of course.
    But as they are, they're as good as useless!
    The thread must be steepy-weeped in three pools of mystic water, you see...${prompt}
  7692: |-
    Alas! In more tranquil times, I would simply-wimply have gone myself.
    But now...no, the war-torn battlefield is no place for a delicate damsel such as I.${prompt}
  7693: |-
    But you! You are a brave warrior, and guarded by the strength of my charm, to bootaru!
    Surely-wurely you could handle this minor task?${prompt}

    Lend Ponono your aid?
    ${selection-lines}

  7696: |-
    Such a bravey-wave and kind soul, you are.
    I can see I entrustarued my charm to good hands!${prompt}
  7697: |-
    The charm, as you see, is comprised of three intertwining threads...but that's not all.
    Each strand must be dippy-wipped in the mystic waters of one of three locations throughout the land to complete the enchantment.
    Only then can it be fashioned into the finished productaru you now hold in your hand.${prompt}
  7698: |-
    The firsty-wirst is this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    This must be imbued with the invigorating waters of the Knightwell in West Ronfaure.${prompt}
  7699: |-
    Next, we have this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. You see?
    This must be gently-wently dipped in the placid waters of the Fay Spring of Grauberg.${prompt}
  7700: |-
    And finally, this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    This requires an infusion of the most peculiar waters of Lake Tepokalipuka, which lies in East Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  7701: |-
    Each spooly-wool of thread has been prepared for enchantment using my family's secret magical recipe.
    When dipped in their respective waters, the strands will take on the most brilliantaru hues you've ever gazed upon!${prompt}
  7702: Bring all three threads back to me in their altered states, and I'll be able to fashion-washion enough charms to outfitaru the entire Windurstian army!${prompt}
  7703: |-
    And thataru should be all you need to know!
    So, do you feel up to the task?${prompt}
  7704: |-
    Are you ready?
    ${selection-lines}
    I surely-wurely am!
    Whataru do I have to do again?${prompt}
  7705: |-
    Excellent! Here are the materials you'll need.
    Mind you, this is the very lastaru of my supply, so take care not to drop it in a ditchy-witch somewhere!${prompt}
  7706: Mercenaries from across the Federation are banging on my doors day and nightaru to get their greedy-weedy hands on my charms. I'm counting on you!${prompt}
  7707: |-
    You've returned!
    Well? Were you able to enchant the three spooly-wools of thread?${prompt}
  7708: 'Hmm... This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} haven''t been enchantarued yet.${prompt}'
  7709: 'Hmm... This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} hasn''t been enchantarued yet.${prompt}'
  7710: |-
    Mercenaries from across the Federation are banging on my doors day and nightaru to get their greedy-weedy hands on my charms.
    Please! Go enchantaru the rest before they break out the battering ram!${prompt}
  7711: |-
    Ah, yes! Look at how beautifully they shimmer!
    You've done it! I truly-wuly can't thank you enough.${prompt}
  7712: Now I have enough thread to make charms for not only our valiantaru soldiers, but their families and loved ones as well!${prompt}
  7713: Ah! What I wouldn'taru give to see the return of a peaceful age where the services of neither charms nor soldiers are needed any longer...${prompt}
  7714: |-
    Sadly, I am but a humble-wumble artisan.
    There is little I can do except supportaru our cause in my own little way.${prompt}
  7715: Oh, perhaps you're curious why the threads must be enchanted with the waters of those three particular mystic pools.${prompt}
  7716: Do you remember our conversation about the magical properties of each thread? It would seem they holdy-wold the answer.${prompt}
  7717: |-
    First, “courage to stand against the most fearsome plightaru.”
    The waters of the Knightwell are said to have bestowed legendary valor upon brave warriors throughoutaru the course of history.${prompt}
  7718: |-
    Secondly, “gentleness to soothy-woothe the deepest wound.”
    The pixies of Grauberg are perhaps the gentlest beings of our world, and the tranquil-wanquil waters of their spring are said to provide transcendentaru peace of mind.${prompt}
  7719: |-
    Lastly, the waters of Lake Tepokalipuka...
    In all honesty-wonesty, this one is a mystery even to me.${prompt}
  7720: |-
    That's one part of our family lore that's been lostaru to the ages.
    In the old language, “Tepokalipuka” means “a ladle with a hole”...
    But to what could that possibly-wossibly refer?${prompt}
  7721: |-
    Heavensy-weavens, look at me! What am I doing getting caughtaru up in a discussion of linguistics!?
    I have charms to craft, orders to fill!${prompt}
  7722: |-
    In any eventaru, you have my eternal gratitude for your aid.
    Take this, and may it bring you the besty-west of fortune for years to come!${prompt}

    One...two...three..
    Hm? Wait a minute, something's not rrright...${prompt}
  10901: |-
    Alright, I'm gonna count over.
    Gimme a minute here...${prompt}
  10902: They say a shadowy figure appeared suddenly in Valdeaunia, the beastman-held lands to the north.${prompt}
  10903: But who could possibly be powerful enough to bring the entire Yagudo Theomilitary under his control?${prompt}
  10904: I am a member of the Wildcats, underrr the able command of General Haja Zhwan.${prompt}
  10905: Have you ever seen her in action on the field of battle? Her crossbow never misses its tarrrget!${prompt}
  10906: It seems those disgusting “maws” have appeared in several rrregions. Have you seen one yet?${prompt}
  10907: Nyaaa, just thinking about them makes my furrr stand on end.${prompt}
  10908: |-
    All of the mercenary leaders are combat specialists. They do it the best, do it dependably, and look good doing it!
    I hope I can be like one of them someday...${prompt}
  10909: If you're lucky enough, maybe you will have the opporrrtunity to fight alongside them.${prompt}
  10910: |-
    A Master Caster is in charge of each War Warlocks unit.
    There's Kayeel-Payeel of the Aquarian War Warlocks, and Zolku-Azolku of the Libran War Warlocks...${prompt}
  10911: A few of them have their peculiarities, but they are all expertarus in magic!${prompt}
  10912: <Sigh>... I can't believe that our beautiful city has come under attack...${prompt}
  10913: If only the pride of our nation, Shantotto was here... She would have nipped the situation in the bud, no doubtaru about it!${prompt}
  10914: |-
    I hope she returns from the northlands soon... and safely.
    Oh Shantotto...${prompt}
  10915: This is the Rhinostery, home to a myriad of research and study concerning all things animal and plantaru.${prompt}
  10916: Unfortunately, with the way things are, we aren't able to conduct our fieldwork outside the city to the extentaru that we would like.${prompt}
  10917: |-
    When night comes, you can see a biiig star in the sky over there.
    Have you seen it yet?${prompt}
  10918: |-
    Everyone is saying that it's some sort of omen that something bad is on its way.
    But I can't imagine that things could get any worse than they already are.${prompt}
  10919: Hey, you! Listen to this. It'll blow your mind!${prompt}
  10920: Nobody else believes me, but when I was on my way to Jeuno on business just recently, I saw a strange beastman. Like none I've ever seen before!${prompt}
  10921: |-
    It was wearing a crown, and a lush mantle on its back.
    And it looked like...well, feline. Some kind of cat-like beastman? I can't be sure...${prompt}
  10922: They say the reason the beastmen are coming after us is ultimately because they are after crystals.${prompt}
  10923: |-
    But I don't see why they have to get so worked up over it. If it's that big a deal to them, let's just give them some crystals.
    Why do they have to go and wreck our city?${prompt}
  10924: |-
    Just take a look around you...
    The city sustained significant damage during the Theomilitary's assault the other day.${prompt}
  10925: |-
    Only this district has been somewhat repaired since then.
    Windurst Walls still remains in ruins, almost totally submerged beneath the waters.${prompt}
  10926: It was Warlock Warlord Robel-Akbel's idea to bring together all of the Federation's forces.${prompt}
  10927: |-
    Even so, none of us affiliated with the military have even seen Robel-Akbel...
    Some of us have begun to question whether or not he even exists!${prompt}
  10928: They say this detestable Yagudo Theomilitary is led by one named Tzee Xicu the Manifest.${prompt}
  10929: |-
    He marshals the throngs of Yagudo from the foul depths of Castle Oztroja.
    There are some rumors, however, that he is actually a she.${prompt}
  10930: The development of various forms of magic has been well underway since the onset of hostilities.${prompt}
  10931: Some are even beginning to dabble again in arts condemned as taboo in former days. Well, that's all just hearsay... ${prompt}
  10932: |-
    Have you ever met Romaa Mihgo?
    She heads the Cobras, the strongest and most ruthless division of the Mithra Mercenaries.${prompt}
  10933: |-
    Her behavior may be a bit...not to some's liking. But her prowess is virtually without match.
    Windurst owes her a great debt of gratitude for her service.${prompt}
  10934: |-
    Oddly enough, though, it seems Romaa Mihgo isn't exactly a fan of the Federation.
    I wonder what it was that convinced her to pledge herself to our cause...${prompt}
  10935: |-
    <Sigh>... To have come all the way from Olzhirya to Windurst just to be met by this scene of destruction...
    But we must remain firm.${prompt}
  10936: |-
    They say the weakening of a nation is generally the result of its leadership.
    I don't know what the Star Sibyl or whoever is running Windurrrst is up to...${prompt}
  10937: Strength is everrrything to us Mithra. A leader without strength is no leader at all.${prompt}
  10938: |-
    Adventurer, do you know Warlock Warlord Robel-Akbel?
    I was able to catch only a glimpse of him at the most recent battle.${prompt}
  10939: |-
    He was wielding the most powerful magic I have ever seen!
    He felled some one hundred Yagudo in the blink of an eye!${prompt}
  10940: I'd give anything to be that powerful...${prompt}
  10941: Yes, I'm a Mithra Mercenary. Do you know of my unit, adventurer? The Anacondas. Led by the grrreat Perih Vashai.${prompt}
  10942: |-
    She is a master of the bow. And not only strong, but smarrrt as a whip to boot.
    There aren't many leaders these days so trusted by their troops as she.${prompt}
  10943: The last Yagudo assault a few days ago was an absolute nightmare.${prompt}
  10944: |-
    The sinister Theomilitary forces were upon us in an instant, an enveloping storm of pitch-black feathers ravaging the city.
    The horrible vision does not leave me...even in my sleep.${prompt}
  10945: Capricornian Master Caster Zonpa-Zippa developed the Cardians as a way to compensate for the Federation's lack of hardened, crack frontline troops.${prompt}
  10946: They still aren't entirely ready for all the applications that we'd like, but they may become capable of handling some simple tasks soon enough.${prompt}
  10947: Just ahead is the Aurastery, Windurst's institute of magic education.${prompt}
  10948: It is most importantaru that we spare no effort in educating our younger generation in our traditional magic. Especially in times such as these...${prompt}
  10949: Today, class, we will be reviewing the basics of healing magic.${prompt}
  10950: |-
    Now please listen and repeat after me.
    C-U-R-E. Cure.${prompt}
  10951: When I grow up, I'm gonna be the biggest Warlock Warlord ever!${prompt}
  10952: Do you know what a warlord is? I'm not quite sure...but it sure sounds really importantaru, right!?${prompt}
  10953: |-
    At first, when the birdmen attacked, I was just really scared...
    I didn't know what to do.${prompt}
  10954: |-
    But then I realized that I had to fight for my Windurst.
    So I stayed behind all the grownups and kept casting the cure spell that my teacher taught me on them.${prompt}
  10955: I was so happy-wappy to see my spells making some of them feel better rightaru away!${prompt}
  10956: People tend to forget, but the real reason that the minister of the Optistery has cooped himself up in the Toraimarai Canal is to save Windurst from the very danger that threatens its existence, not to escape it.${prompt}
  10957: |-
    All alone in that creepy-weepy, dark place for days and days...
    I can't even imagine what it must be like.${prompt}
  10958: |-
    This bridge was nearly obliterated in a recent Yagudo attack.
    We just finished rebuilding it to the state that you see now.${prompt}
  10959: I just hope we don'taru have to do this again...${prompt}
  10960: A while ago my brother joined the War Warlocks.${prompt}
  10961: Even though I'm proud that he is one of the warlock elitaru, I can't help but worry if he's alright or not...<sigh>.${prompt}
  10962: Fort Karugo-Narugo is our stronghold to the north. It's absolutely essential for the defense of Windurst.${prompt}
  10963: You might even go so far as to call it the jewel in the crown that is Windurst's magical defense against the Yagudo invasion...I'm sorry, that was a bit much...${prompt}
  10964: |-
    Meeeooow... They say it's dangerrrous here, but I can't leave without my mama!
    Have you seen her anywhere, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady]?${prompt}
  10965: |-
    Mama is big and strrrong, and loves me more than anyone in the whole wide world.
    I know she'll come back soon!${prompt}
  10966: |-
    I travel all the way from Bastok to peddle my wares, and now they order me off the streets?
    No sympathy for a businesswoman's plight, I tell you...${prompt}
  10967: |-
    But I shouldn't be so selfish.
    The poor Tarutaru and Mithra of this nation suffer far more than I.${prompt}
  10968: My mommy told me to run to Windurst Walls before the scary-wary monsters come, but I forgotaru how to get there!${prompt}
  10969: |-
    But it's okay! My brother will keep us safe.
    He's a big-time War Warlock, you know!${prompt}
  10970: |-
    All my friends ran and took sheltaru in Windurst Waters.
    Am I s'posed to go with them...?${prompt}
  10971: |-
    I've never seen everyone in such a panic-wanic.
    I don't know whether to be scared or excitarued!${prompt}
  10972: My teachy-weacher says we need to “e-vac-u-a-taru.”${prompt}
  10973: I don't know what that means, but it sure sounds fun!${prompt}
  10974: |-
    Woohoo, class dismissed!
    We're gonna have so much fun in Heavens Tower--I'm bringing all my toys!${prompt}
  10975: |-
    Our nation stands on the brink of destruction, and you'd think these two were on their way to a picky-wicnic.
    Ah, the blissful ignorance of children! Perhaps it's for the bestaru...${prompt}
  10976: |-
    A state of emerrrgency's been declared, or haven't you heard?
    This is no time to be trrraipsing about the city!${prompt}
  10977: |-
    Civilians have been ordered to take shelter in Heavens Tower.
    You'd best be off to wherever you belong--confusion in the strrreets will only serve to heighten the danger.${prompt}
  10978: |-
    Grrr... Those birdmen did a number on Windurst Walls, I'll tell you.
    Shattered roofs, collapsed brrridges... The place is in shambles!${prompt}
  10979: |-
    But the citizens are already hard at work repairing the damages.
    We'll see the Walls restored to their former glorrry before you know it!${prompt}
  10980: |-
    We are closed to the public in mourning of our late Minister Karaha-Baruha.
    Even during his long absence, the thought of his return was enough to motivate us to take the utmost pride in our duties tending the archives.
    Whatever will become of us now?${prompt}
  10981: |-
    Is it true that Minister Karaha-Baruha summoned the Great Beast? That it was a glorious sightaru, like nothing of this world?
    I was stuck in Heavens Tower and missed everything!${prompt}
  10982: |-
    What? You were there!?
    Consider yourself lucky. That's a moment that will go down in history-wistory!${prompt}
  10983: Why, if it isn't ${name-player}! Heheheh...${prompt}
  10984: So, how does it feel to be the merrrcenary of the moment?${prompt}
  10985: The entire camp's been buzzing with the rrrumors of your accomplishments the other day!${prompt}
  10986: Why, you even earned the adorrration of that wacky little Warlock Warlord. You sure know how to make a gal jealous!${prompt}
  10987: I'm so prrroud to have you as a member of the team.${prompt}
  10988: I'm so prrroud to be buddies with a mercenary like you.${prompt}
  10989: What? You're wonderrring why it's so quiet here at Cobra Command?${prompt}
  10990: Hmmm...let's just say that people--Mithra, in particular--don't always get along well with each otherrr, and when that happens, sometimes it's best to keep a low profile until things cool down.${prompt}
  10991: Ah.
  10992: Where do you think you'rrre going!?
  10993: Nooo, you can't leave!
  10994: Masterrr Lehko!
  10995: Meowww! No one escapes from Mikhe Arrryohcha!
  10996: Too many rrrivals! Looks like some friendly elimination is in order!
  10997: Therrre!
  10998: (I said, shut it, Guttler! I'm the one who's gonna feast on the prrrince, not you!)${prompt}
  10999: Nooo, where did he disappearrr to...?${prompt}
  11000: Now look what you've all gone and done, scarrring him off like that!${prompt}
  11001: Oi, you're the one who trrried to make a mithkabob out of poor Master Lehko!${prompt}
  11002: |-
    <Sniff, sniff>...
    This scent is mine, and mine alone! You girrrls had better keep your nostrils sealed!${prompt}
  11003: Keep on drrreaming! I'm not giving up my claim to Master Lehko!${prompt}
  11004: (Damn it, Guttler! How many times do I have to tell you to shut it? Do you want me to thrrrow you away!?)${prompt}
  11005: <Sigh> He can be so coldhearrrted sometimes...so why do I keep on coming back?${prompt}
  11006: Tihl! Why arrren't you at your post!?${prompt}
  11007: Y-yikes, it's the boss!${prompt}
  11008: |-
    ...And look who else is here.
    Haja! Mikhe! Vhino! Lhu!${prompt}
  11009: Meow?${prompt}
  11010: Mercenary leaderrrs like yourselves should know best the dirrre situation Windurst is in!${prompt}
  11011: And yet I find you all here chasing after a man like love-starved kittens! Isn't there a single morrrsel of shame to be found in this entire litter!?${prompt}
  11012: A-and who are you to prrreach, eh?${prompt}
  11013: What are you talking about?${prompt}
  11014: Yeah, Romaa! We all saw what happened back at Fort Karugo-Narugo!${prompt}
  11015: '!?${prompt}'
  11016: Yeah, you and the prince were getting all snuggly-wuggly up there on that chocobo, to say it in the local dialect!${prompt}
  11017: Th-that was...${prompt}
  11018: '...${prompt}'
  11019: These are interrresting accusations you bring. Now, how do you all intend to back up your claims?${prompt}
  11020: Uh-oh...${prompt}
  11021: S-she's ticked off rrreal good...${prompt}
  11022: Have at me, all of you! We'll see who's right...and who's grrravely mistaken.${prompt}
  11023: You surrre have guts, I'll give you that. I've been itching to test my mettle with you for some time now, so I'm up for whatever you think you can thrrrow at me.${prompt}
  11024: Nooo, me first, me firrrst! Master Lehko's supposed to have a thing for strong women, and I wanna prove myself!${prompt}
  11025: Oh, is that so...? If that's indeed the trrruth, then I'll have to feast on all of you! (Yes, Guttler, you can join in this time.)${prompt}
  11026: No, no, no! It wasn't supposed to turn out this way! The boss was supposed to make things rrright!${prompt}
  11027: If there's a repeat of the last internal dispute and the ministry buildings end up being rrrazed to the ground again...${prompt}
  11028: Us mercenaries will get kicked out of Windurst for good and end up...unemployed!${prompt}
  11029: What am I supposed to do!?${prompt}
  11030: Ah!${prompt}
  11031: Everyone, I've just remembered a very imporrrtant detail. You see this person here?${prompt}
  11032: Master Lehko was sniffing at ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] for ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] scent just the other day.${prompt}
  11033: M-m-meow!?${prompt}
  11034: I smell something deliciously suspicious here. Could they be more than just...frrriends to each other?${prompt}
  11035: What did you say!?${prompt}
  11036: (I'm rrreally sorry, ${name-player}.)${prompt}
  11037: '...${prompt}'
  11038: 'Noooooo, that''s not trrrue! That''s impossible! You must''ve seduced his innocent hearrrt with ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, you contemptible fiend!${prompt}'
  11039: Hold it, Mihke. This irresistible arrroma...${prompt}
  11040: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, I gather? You truly are a naive little kitten to believe a dirty trrrick like that will work on veteran mercenaries like us. I think some good old-fashioned bloodletting is in orderrr.${prompt}'
  11041: 'Wrrrong again, Haja. This could only be the smell of ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Your nose must be severrrely clogged up with Yagudo glue.${prompt}'
  11042: (Nooo, they were supposed to be distracted by ${name-player}!)${prompt}
  11043: <Sigh>... ${prompt}
  11044: Internal warfarrre is the last thing we need right now. ${name-player}, I want you to find and bring back the heartthrob who's the cause of all this rrruckus.${prompt}
  11045: I caught a glimpse of Lehko making a dash for Odin's Gate. He's prrrobably holing out somewhere in West Sarutabaruta right now.${prompt}
  11046: Master Lehko's wherrreabouts, you ask? My feline instincts tell me he's somewhere in West Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  11047: If you don't find him soon, I'm afrrraid the Mithra will end up finishing what the beastmen started...${prompt}
  11048: What? Master Lehko has collapsed from starrrvation!?${prompt}
  11049: It-it's an emerrrgency! We need to get food to him right away!${prompt}
  11050: Planning to sneak off somewhere durrring guard duty, Dhea?${prompt}
  11051: Awww...${prompt}
  11052: Hm? Lehko's in trrrouble, you say?${prompt}
  11053: Not so unusual for a male Mithra, I suppose... ${name-player}, I want you to take something tasty to him.${prompt}
  11054: I knew it! Deep underneath that demonic exteriorrr, the boss is actually a kindhearted soul!${prompt}
  11055: |-
    You think so? That's really sweet of you to--
    I-I mean, don't misunderstand me! He saved my life, and I'm just returning the favorrr, that's all!${prompt}
  11056: |-
    But, getting back to the order of business...
    Those raised on the motherland have a notorious rrreputation for being fussy when it comes to cuisine. And I don't want us to be looked down upon as an unrrrefined bunch of Mithra brought up in the sticks...${prompt}
  11057: A few skewers of Mihgo mithkabob would've been perrrfect for the occasion, but I'm fresh out of ingredients to make more...${prompt}
  11058: |-
    I've got it!
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]}--it's a traditional Mithran favorite that's bound to please. Now, what else...${prompt}
  11059: Hey, boss!${prompt}
  11060: Just thought you might like to know that many of the girls here have vorrracious appetites. Might be worth asking their opinions.${prompt}
  11061: |-
    Good point there, Dhea.
    ${name-player}, why don't you ask arrround the mercenary camp for other food ideas?${prompt}
  11062: |-
    Good point there, Dhea.
    ${name-player}, why don't you ask arrround the mercenary camp for other food ideas?${prompt}
  11063: '${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} is about the most popularrr thing there is in Mithran cuisine. Chances are it''ll be to Master Lehko''s liking.${prompt}'
  11064: The mercenaries here at Huntsman's Court ought to have some good food ideas to share, so go do some rrresearch!${prompt}
  11065: What? Food that our Gha Nabohan prrrince will enjoy?${prompt}
  11066: 'Why, that would be ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, naturrrally!${prompt}'
  11067: |-
    The irresistible, pungent aroma that permeates when you grrrill them makes my nostrils flare and--
    <Slurp>...my mouth water!${prompt}
  11068: Oh? You're wonderrring what cuisine our honored guest from Gha Naboh might find delectable?${prompt}
  11069: |-
    Hmm, let me see...
    How about ${item-singular: 0[2]}? It's something they don't have in the motherland.${prompt}
  11070: You're in luck because they're in season right now and should be plump and juicy. Preparation methods differrr, but the only way to eat them is headfirst, smack-bang right down your gob!${prompt}
  11071: 'We Mithra, rrregardless of upbringing, have one thing in common: We''re all suckers for ${item-singular: 0[2]}! So the choice is obvious!${prompt}'
  11072: It's just that I haven't seen any since coming over to this continent. And it could be prrricey to import...${prompt}
  11073: But when I recall the overwhelming sensation of ecstasy you get from just a whiff...I'm convinced it's worth the cost. No other food has such a ferrrocious hold over us Mithra!${prompt}
  11074: This Yagudo force...it's endless!${prompt}
  11075: |-
    Ahahahaha!
    The more the better! Bring on every lastaru one of them!${prompt}
  11076: |-
    Go forth and destroy, my masterpieces of magical, mechanical mayhem!
    Not ten, not a hundred, not even a thousand beaked beastmen are a match for the mighty-wight of the Cardians!${prompt}
  11077: |-
    Pain! Destruction! Exhilaration!
    What better way to testaru my creations!?${prompt}
  11078: Hm?${prompt}
  11079: Am I too late for the action?
  11080: |-
    Oho, no magic-immune equipment for these troops.
    They have yet to outfit the entire army, it seems.${prompt}
  11081: |-
    What an excellent opportunity to unleash the full extent of my wrath.
    I felt a little left out, what with all those Elvaan and Mithra stealing all the glory!${prompt}
  11082: |-
    Robel-Akbel!
    You're interfering with my magnificentaru field experiment!${prompt}
  11083: My apologies, dear Zonpa-Zippa.${prompt}
  11084: |-
    It seems our “subterranean” problem has been taken care of as well.
    The battle is almost won...!${prompt}
  11085: |-
    Hear me, defenders of Windurst!
    This brave soul has triumphed over a second Yagudo force that sought to ambush us!${prompt}
  11086: |-
    There will be no more reinforcements for our enemies!
    If we win this field, the day is ours...!${prompt}
  11087: Sniveling wretches.${prompt}
  11088: You have stained my honor...${prompt}
  11089: |-
    But your squeals of glee are hasty.
    Today's battle was nothing more than a prelude in the dirge of your nation's obliteration...${prompt}
  11090: They're retreating!?${prompt}
  11091: |-
    Disciples of malice!
    Learn the stingy-wing of defeataru!${prompt}
  11092: What, is it over already?${prompt}
  11093: '...${prompt}'
  11094: Victory!${prompt}
  11095: The city is saved!${prompt}
  11096: Now is the time to heal your wounds...${prompt}
  11097: '...and mourn the passing of friends.${prompt}'
  11098: |-
    Phew...
    That was a scrrrap and a half.${prompt}
  11099: |-
    But they pulled out as soon as the tables turned.
    Gotta say I'm imprrressed with their sense of practicality.${prompt}
  11100: |-
    Hey, Romaa.
    It looked like you were sleeping for a bit there, but maybe you were just moving rrreally slow...${prompt}
  11101: |-
    Wha-!
    This coming from the brave soldier who hides up out of harm's rrreach!${prompt}
  11102: Hehehe...${prompt}
  11103: Hehe...ahahaha!${prompt}
  11104: Hey, did you come from the homeland?${prompt}
  11105: Maybe I did.${prompt}
  11106: |-
    Do you like bluetail?
    We could go fishin' down by the porrrt!${prompt}
  11107: That sounds like fun.${prompt}
  11108: Hey! You just prrromised to have dinner with me!${prompt}
  11109: I saw him first!${prompt}
  11110: Now now, ladies, let's not fight.${prompt}
  11111: Ah, we meet again.${prompt}
  11112: |-
    I was watching you back at the fort.
    Imprrressive.${prompt}
  11113: Hmmm...
  11114: <Sniff, sniff>...
  11115: Interrresting.${prompt}
  11116: Ah, where are my manners?${prompt}
  11117: 'This ${choice: 0}[lady/gentleman] is one of yours?${prompt}'
  11118: Th-that's rrright...${prompt}
  11119: Well, after a fashion...${prompt}
  11120: And your name...?${prompt}
  11121: |-
    ${name-player}, is it?
    I am Lehko Habhoka.
    I think we'll be firm frrriends.${prompt}
  11122: '!!!${prompt}'
  11123: I'll be seeing you...${prompt}
  11124: A male Mithra...${prompt}
  11125: He was certainly the center of attention...${prompt}
  11126: Not surprising, considering how few people on this continent are likely to have seen one.${prompt}
  11127: Heh, he catch your fancy?${prompt}
  11128: O-of course not!${prompt}
  11129: |-
    Something about that name...
    Lehko Habhoka...? Lehko...${prompt}
  11130: |-
    What's this now?
    I think you're the one whose fancy's being tickled!${prompt}
  11131: '...${prompt}'
  11132: |-
    Well done, ${name-player}.
    You played a big parrrt in this victory.${prompt}
  11133: |-
    And we've had word that the Royal Knights put the last nail in the Yagudo's coffin back at Fort Karugo-Narugo.
    They rrreally pulled our fur out of the fire.${prompt}
  11134: According to Tihl and Mihl, you're partially rrresponsible for their change of heart!${prompt}
  11135: I knew you'd make a good soldier the moment I laid eyes on you.${prompt}
  11136: |-
    Here's a little pat on the back from me.
    Enjoy!${prompt}
  11137: |-
    Master Caster Kamolo-Domilo of the Sagittarian War Warlocks.
    Do you understand the gravity of your transgression?${prompt}
  11138: Sir...${prompt}
  11139: You misrepresented the Star Sibyl and sent troops to Castle Oztroja under false authorization...${prompt}
  11140: M-my most abjectaru apologies...${prompt}
  11141: |-
    Your actions placed Fort Karugo-Narugo and the city of Windurst in mortal peril.
    How will you repent for this crime?${prompt}
  11142: Anything! I'll do anything...!${prompt}
  11143: Close your eyes.${prompt}
  11144: Uh...!?${prompt}
  11145: Pray to the moon and the stars...${prompt}
  11146: |-
    Ah, the poor little thing...
    Have you no mercy?${prompt}
  11147: That's rich, coming from you.${prompt}
  11148: Whatever do you mean...?${prompt}
  11149: |-
    Fine. Play the innocent.
    You know as well as I do that justice has a price.${prompt}
  11150: And I will protect Windurst...by any means necessary...${prompt}
  11151: |-
    Hmm...
    I'm happy with the way things turned out.
    And I have a fascinating new piece to play with.${prompt}
  11152: '...${prompt}'
  11153: Will ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] be a knight? A bishop?${prompt}
  11154: Or just another enthusiastic pawn...?${prompt}
  11155: '...${prompt}'
  11156: Even pawns have their uses...${prompt}
  11157: ${name-player}, you slipped off in such a hurry last time.${prompt}
  11158: |-
    Here's that “pat on the back” I mentioned.
    Keep up the good work!${prompt}
  11159: |-
    Oh! Roadblock!
    What are you doing here? Come for a visitaru with the boy-genius of Windurst, have you?${prompt}
  11160: |-
    I'm sorry to inform you, but I have a super-confidential meeting to attend.
    No time for idle chin-wagging!${prompt}
  11161: |-
    What's the meeting about?
    Well, if I told you, it wouldn'taru be confidential now, would it?
    Hmm...maybe you should just come along.${prompt}
  11162: |-
    Accompany Ajido-Marujido to the meeting?
    ${selection-lines}
    I love secret meetings!
    No thanks, meetings make me sleepy...${prompt}
  11163: |-
    I figure you've earned your place after last time.
    Come along, then. No dawdling!${prompt}
  11164: |-
    Your loss.
    Later, roadblock!${prompt}
  11165: Look...the War Warlocks have gathered in secretaru!
  11166: |-
    Hm? You thought we were invited to this meeting?
    Don'taru be absurd.${prompt}
  11167: A potential Wise Wizard such as myself must master the art of reconnaissance!${prompt}
  11168: And I also had to see what kind of goodies the grown-ups get to eat at these hush-wushy get-togethers...${prompt}
  11169: It appears everyone is in attendance.${prompt}
  11170: |-
    I'll cut right to the meat of the matter.
    Windurst is facing a crisis she has not known since the Federation was first founded.${prompt}
  11171: |-
    The Yagudo Theocracy has committed its full forces to the front line, and is relentlessly marching south.
    They mean to engulf the city of Windurst with overwhelming numbers.${prompt}
  11172: Fort Karugo-Narugo stands as our last line of defense.${prompt}
  11173: And that is why I intend to make a request for San d'Orian reinforcements.${prompt}
  11174: |-
    You would grovel before the Royal Knights?
    Those pointy-eared prance-abouts have been our mortal enemies for generations!${prompt}
  11175: |-
    We are now a part of the Allied Forces.
    San d'Oria is a nation of proud warriors--their aid would be invaluable.${prompt}
  11176: B-but...${prompt}
  11177: |-
    <Yawn>...
    It's all the same to me...${prompt}
  11178: Master Caster Pattna-Ottna of the Taurean War Warlocks.${prompt}
  11179: It will be your duty to make the request for reinforcements to the Royal Knight General.${prompt}
  11180: S-sir, yes sir!${prompt}
  11181: And since I detest sitting around sucking my thumb, I intend to execute my aforementioned strategy...${prompt}
  11182: |-
    You mean...that strategy?
    The one where you storm Castle Oztroja!?${prompt}
  11183: |-
    Insanity!
    You would do better rally-wallying the Mithra Mercenaries and seeing to the defenses of the city, rather than wasting lives on a hopeless assaultaru...${prompt}
  11184: |-
    The Mithra will remain here.
    I shall be taking only my personal guard.${prompt}
  11185: '!?${prompt}'
  11186: But, Warlock Warlord, even with your formidable powers...${prompt}
  11187: Your concern is touching, but misplaced, Zolku-Azolku.${prompt}
  11188: Zonpa-Zippa!${prompt}
  11189: I leave command of the city defenses in your hands during my absence.${prompt}
  11190: |-
    Ahahaha! And such capable hands they are!
    So capable, you needn'taru even bother coming back!${prompt}
  11191: Master Caster Kamolo-Domilo of the Sagittarian War Warlocks.${prompt}
  11192: Sir.${prompt}
  11193: Your duty shall be to command the defenses of Fort Karugo-Narugo. The Tigress Volunteers and the Cobra Mercenaries will be dispatched to provide a sizeable fighting force.${prompt}
  11194: '...${prompt}'
  11195: Are you displeased with your assignment?${prompt}
  11196: N-no, sir.${prompt}
  11197: |-
    If something should befall the enchanted walls, the fortress will become vulnerable.
    Situate the mercenaries in key locations to repel any sudden assaults.${prompt}
  11198: |-
    “He” shall serve as your advisor.
    You may see more cooperation with a suitable intermediary.${prompt}
  11199: |-
    These orders are effective immediately.
    To your posts.${prompt}
  11200: Oho, this was a most successful reconna--${prompt}
  11201: Well, now!${prompt}
  11202: Wha--!?${prompt}
  11203: I see we have a pair of snoopsy-woopsy interlopers!${prompt}
  11204: I-I was justaru practicing my information-gather--${prompt}
  11205: |-
    Silence!
    This is no place for children!
    Out with you!${prompt}
  11206: Waaah!${prompt}
  11207: |-
    What could the Warlock Warlord possibly-wossibly be thinking?
    Does he mean to hog all the glory for himself again?${prompt}
  11208: |-
    Glory?
    He'll return to a city of smoking ashy-wash and ruin if he leaves it to the mercy of the Theocracy.${prompt}
  11209: |-
    This cravy-waving to be on the forefront of the action is insufferable!
    I don't care if he is the Warlock Warlord.${prompt}
  11210: |-
    His policies have our fair city crawling with Mithran mercenaries.
    And he speaks of sendy-wending for even more reinforcements from Olzhirya...${prompt}
  11211: |-
    As if that weren'taru bad enough, now we have this request for Elvaan reinforcements.
    Has his thirstaru for conflict blinded him to the consequences of his actions?${prompt}
  11212: |-
    I can'taru let this madness continue.
    Your day will come soon, Robel-Akbel...${prompt}
  11213: '...${prompt}'
  11214: Hmm, not bad...${prompt}
  11215: |-
    Things appear to be prrrogressing to plan.
    I hope nothing has been forgotten...?${prompt}
  11216: |-
    Do not underestimate the shrewdness of the Yagudo.
    They will ruthlessly strike at any weakness in the fort's defenses.${prompt}
  11217: But if we can strike a mortal blow in the meantime...${prompt}
  11218: I am willing to make sacrifices for the greater good.${prompt}
  11219: Oho. How rrreassuring.${prompt}
  11220: There is one for whom this must be done...${prompt}
  11221: Let's see if your bite is as ferrrocious as your bark...${prompt}
  11222: What are ya doin' lyin' around, brrrat?${prompt}
  11223: Oh!${prompt}
  11224: Don't ya rrremember what day it is!?${prompt}
  11225: |-
    That's right!
    The professor...!${prompt}
  11226: |-
    He's leavin' through the Windurst Waters gate.
    It may be the last time ya see him in one piece, so ya better give him a prrroper sendoff!${prompt}
  11227: R-right!${prompt}
  11228: Please take good-dang-doodily care of the kids while I'm gone-aroo.${prompt}
  11229: |-
    You've got nothing to worry about.
    That Ajido-Marujido handled himself prrretty well back there at the fort.${prompt}
  11230: |-
    Speak of the devil...
    Rrrest easy, we'll make a man out of him, you'll see.${prompt}
  11231: Oh...diddly...${prompt}
  11232: ?${prompt}
  11233: Now Ajido, I'll be absentified for a time, so don't go making a noodling-nuisance of yourself, alright-areeno?${prompt}
  11234: |-
    Ah, good to see-aree you again.
    My duties take me to Jeuno, and I'd be most tank-rankingly-thankful if you could keep an eye-areeno on this troublemaker.${prompt}
  11235: |-
    There's a research effort in pin-diddly-progress to alleviate-aroo the food shortage caused by the war.
    Researchers from across Vana'diel are gathering to offer their ding-doodily-ideas.${prompt}
  11236: |-
    I've been personally invitified to participate-areeno.
    I must do my bang-bingingly-best so that children like Ajido can grow up to be healthy and strong-aroo.${prompt}
  11237: |-
    Don'taru you fret about Ajido-Marujido!
    By the time you return, I shall have become a resplendent War Warlock!${prompt}
  11238: I'm sorry I can only spare a couple of kittens to escort you to Jeuno, Professor.${prompt}
  11239: I'd prrrefer to have some more seasoned mercenaries guide you on the trip, but...${prompt}
  11240: |-
    His High and Mightiness, the Warlock Warlord, isn't shy about rrrequisitioning my troops.
    Most of my girls were just hustled off to rrreinforce Fort Karugo-Narugo.${prompt}
  11241: Tihl! Mihl!${prompt}
  11242: Ma'am!${prompt}
  11243: Yes, ma'am!${prompt}
  11244: |-
    You two are charged with seeing the professor safe to Jeuno.
    No sidetrrrips!${prompt}
  11245: No prrroblem!${prompt}
  11246: |-
    <Sigh>...
    (Show some rrrespect, will ya?)
    Leave it to us, boss!${prompt}
  11247: |-
    Ahaha, I may look a little soft-diddly-droopy around the middle, but I'm still an elite graduate of the Aurastery.
    I'm not so hang-doodily-helpless as all that!${prompt}
  11248: |-
    I must be off.
    Farewell-areeno!${prompt}
  11249: Windurst will be safe in our paws!${prompt}
  11250: |-
    Hmmm...I don't know about those kittens.
    They haven't even cut their teeth on an enemy yet.${prompt}
  11251: Maybe I should go with them?${prompt}
  11252: |-
    Don't be foolish.
    The professor'd just have to turn around and brrring you home.${prompt}
  11253: '...${prompt}'
  11254: |-
    This seems like a job for you, ${name-player}.
    Could you chase them down and make sure they rrreach Jeuno safely?${prompt}
  11255: Once Tihl and Mihl see the professor off, tell them to join the rrrest of our unit at Karugo-Narugo.${prompt}
  11256: This seems like a job for you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11257: |-
    Could you chase them down and make sure they rrreach Jeuno safely?
    I knew I could count on you!${prompt}
  11258: |-
    ${name-player}!
    Stop picking fleas out of your fur and get your tail over to Castle Oztroja! Get the Tigresses outta there!${prompt}
  11259: |-
    Head on back to the fort.
    I'll join you there with Major Vashai as soon as we get mobilized.${prompt}
  11260: Have you forgotten what the Warlock Warlord said?${prompt}
  11261: Maybe you should try talking to Rotih Moalghett at the fort.${prompt}
  11262: Dear-ethy me, whatever will I do...${prompt}
  11263: Yes? Is there-ethy something I can do for you? I'm Yoran-Oran, Minister of the Rhinostery.${prompt}
  11264: What? You want to know-ethy what's troubling me?${prompt}
  11265: 'Actually-ethy, I had borrowed ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} from the Library of Magic...but I lost it.${prompt}'
  11266: The truth is, it was stolen-ethy from me by the Yagudo when I went to investigate lycopodium flowers in West Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  11267: It was very-ethy careless and un-ministerly of me to let the Yagudo run off with the book like that. If word gets out, I fear my reputation-ethy will be tarnished irreparably.${prompt}
  11268: The Optistery, the Ministry that runs the Library of Magic, has sent me a rather unkind letter requesting the immediate return-ethy of the book...${prompt}
  11269: Aaargh! They'll cry for my hide-ethy when they find out what happened! ${prompt}
  11270: I'm willing to wager the book was taken-ethy to Giddeus, where the Yagudo reside.${prompt}
  11271: But with all their temples and sacred grounds located there-ethy, we can't just go strolling in...${prompt}
  11272: If we try, they'll be infuriated...so much so that they may even go so far-ethy as to send their hordes against Windurst!${prompt}
  11273: Trying to devise a peaceful solution-ethy has given me a throbbing headache...${prompt}
  11274: But... I can't help but wonder-ethy why they were after that particular book. I've seen many a strange thing-ethy in my life, but a book-loving Yagudo???${prompt}
  11275: I'm willing to wager-ethy the Yagudo took the book to Giddeus, but we can't just go strolling in.${prompt}
  11276: This is a predicament for the ages! There has to be a peaceful way to get the book back-ethy...${prompt}
  11277: 'Goodness gracious me-ethy! This is the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} I was trying to recover! And all this time-ethy I''d thought it lost somewhere in Giddeus.${prompt}'
  11278: What a relief--I mean, eek! How on Vana'diel did it get-ethy into such a raggedy state?${prompt}
  11279: Curse the Yagudo, and curse their lack of respect-ethy for literature! The book needs to be repaired...${prompt}
  11280: Tosuka-Porika at the Optistery will be the best Tarutaru to consult-ethy with.${prompt}
  11281: He'll give me several pieces of his mind for returning the book late-ethy...and in tatters, but there's no one else to turn to.${prompt}
  11282: I've got it! Why don't you come with me and share the blame-ethy?${prompt}
  11283: I have to take the book to the Optistery for repairs.${prompt}
  11284: You can accompany me and share the blame-ethy when I speak with Tosuka-Porika!${prompt}
  11285: Hrmmm? Who is it? This is the Optistery. You can't just come barging in--oh, it's you, Yoran-Oran.${prompt}
  11286: My dear Tosuka-Porika, it has been too long-ethy! When was the last time we sat down together for a nice steaming cup of Windurstian tea? I came here to see when you were next free...and uh, also to return this book-ethy...${prompt}
  11287: Hrrrm! I don't recall the Library of Magic lending out half-decayed books! Explain yourself!${prompt}
  11288: I-it wasn't my fault! The cursed Yagudo are to blame-ethy!${prompt}
  11289: The Yagudo, you say? Hmph. What's done is done. The book, though, needs to be repaired, and I expect all expenditure to be borne by the Rhinostery.${prompt}
  11290: Ugh...ethy.${prompt}
  11291: Hrm... Are you certain this was the Yagudo's handiwork? Didn't you just spill a beaker of some bogus remedy the Rhinostery concocted?${prompt}
  11292: Of course not! Believe me when I say it's not my fault-ethy!${prompt}
  11293: 'If you say so... But to make the repairs, we''ll be needing ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  11294: 'I know what ${item-plural: 0[2]} are, but ${keyitem-plural: 1[2]}...?${prompt}'
  11295: 'Lynx are beasts kept by the Yagudo, so I expect the birdmen to have ${keyitem-plural: 1[2]} in their possession. You''ll have to go and “negotiate” yourself one.${prompt}'

    Wh-what am I supposed to do? March-ethy up to a Yagudo and say, “I'll have a cherry muffin... Oh, and ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} too, please.”
    That's lunacy-ethy!${prompt}
  11297: |-
    Hrmmm...
    Hey, you there. You work for the Rhinostery, right? Life sure is tough when your own minister's a dud, huh?${prompt}
  11298: Enough-ethy with the insults!${prompt}
  11299: I hate to involve a third party, but I need you to go and procure the items. It's unfair, but it always falls upon the underling to mop up ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] boss's mess.${prompt}
  11300: 'There''s a good chance you''ll be able to find ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} inside Castle Oztroja. Perhaps a forgetful Yagudo has left one lying around.${prompt}'
  11301: P-please! You must help-ethy me!${prompt}
  11302: 'Bring me ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} so you can help out that hopeless boss of yours.${prompt}'
  11303: 'You should be able to find ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} at Castle Oztroja.${prompt}'
  11304: Hrmmmmmm... Yes, yes, these will do. These will do just fine.${prompt}
  11305: Now I can finally repair the book.${prompt}
  11306: Phew... Thank you for saving my hide-ethy!${prompt}
  11307: I'm glad it's over. Tosuka-Porika should be able to return the book to its original state-ethy in no time.${prompt}
  11308: Hrrrm! There! It's back in perfectly pristine condition!${prompt}
  11309: I also took the liberty of repairing the leaf of paper wedged inside the book.${prompt}
  11310: A leaf-ethy of paper? Oh, you mean the one I was using as a bookmark? I don't really need it though...${prompt}
  11311: Hey, why don't you keep it? Think of it as a small reward-ethy for your help.${prompt}
  11312: All's well that ends well-ethy. Thank you for saving my hide-ethy.${prompt}

  11321: Without the proper resources, I could continue my work for decades and never completaru the formula...${prompt}

    I don't know how long I can preventaru Maju-Naju from rush-wushing headlong into certain death. I wish there was some way to bring the fireblossom in Grauberg here to him...${prompt}
  11338: |-
    Oh! You're the one who broughtaru me that wonderful book!
    But I still have no fireblossom to begin the extraction process...${prompt}
  11339: You...you harvested the fireblossom in my stead!?${prompt}

    Oh my! What a marvelous individual!
    Now all that remains is to...!${prompt}
  11341: |-
    Ah, would you mind if I...?
    I mustaru return to my research!${prompt}
  11342: |-
    I haven't seen Maju-Naju so elated in years.
    You've done a wonderful thing here.${prompt}
  11343: Why don'taru you come back a little later and see the results for yourself?${prompt}
  11344: Hehehe...${prompt}
  11345: Hehehehehehe...${prompt}
  11346: |-
    Ahahahahahaha!
    I've done it...
    The day has finally come...!${prompt}
  11347: |-
    Maju-Naju, that maniacal laughter...
    Does this mean...?${prompt}
  11348: |-
    Behold!
    The cure is ready!${prompt}
  11349: |-
    Oho!
    Congratulations!${prompt}
  11350: |-
    Please, you mustaru see this!
    It is your selfless generosity that made this possible in the first place!${prompt}
  11351: You have my mostaru profound gratitude.${prompt}
  11352: |-
    Come this way!
    Let us witness this miracle together!${prompt}
  11353: Ah, how long have I dreamed of this day!?${prompt}
  11354: Hm...mmm...${prompt}
  11355: Maju-Naju...?${prompt}
  11356: Shahr!${prompt}
  11357: |-
    Am I awake?
    Or is this still a drrream...?${prompt}
  11358: |-
    You're awake!
    This saintly stranger found a way to cure your illness!${prompt}
  11359: '...?${prompt}'
  11360: |-
    I can't believe it.
    I feel so alert--it's like I was never sick in the first place...${prompt}
  11361: |-
    Oh happy day!
    How can I ever repay you!?
    Will you at leastaru tell us your name?${prompt}
  11362: Thank you again, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  11363: (Hey! ${name-player}!)${prompt}
  11364: (Now that the sleeping beauty is awake, I think we should leave her alone with her prince, don'taru you?)${prompt}
  11365: |-
    It seems our work here is done.
    We'll leave you two to catch up!${prompt}

  11367: |-
    I'll check in on you later.
    Ta-taru!${prompt}
  11368: Ah, you're back! Both Maju-Naju and Shahr are doing justaru fine!${prompt}
  11369: They've been waiting for you, actually!${prompt}
  11370: ${name-player}!${prompt}
  11371: Thanks to you, Shahr has fully recovered!${prompt}
  11372: This illness has been conquered, but I've decided to continue my research in the medicinal field so I can help other people in need.${prompt}
  11373: |-
    I've never been so happy.
    Naturally, I'm grrrateful that I've been cured...${prompt}
  11374: But what trrruly warms my heart is the beaming smile I see on Maju-Naju's face.${prompt}
  11375: While I was ill, he was never able to fully hide the concern under his brave grrrin.${prompt}
  11376: Now when I see him smile, it's like the sun has broken thrrrough the clouds.${prompt}
  11377: |-
    Here's the book you lentaru me.
    Its contents were invaluable in my research.${prompt}
  11378: |-
    And I mustaru give you something for your assistance!
    My mind has been so filled with blissy-wiss, I completaruly forgot...${prompt}
  11379: Here, please take this token of my gratitude.${prompt}
  11380: Nehehe! It's so prrretty. My prrretty little stone. Meow!${prompt}
  11381: As long as Mama doesn't find out. Nehehe!${prompt}
  11382: '${color-alt: 15}Kocco Ehllek seems extremely pleased with herself...'
  11383: Kocco! There you are!${prompt}
  11384: Meow?${prompt}
  11385: You stole another gem from Shairiri's shop, didn't you!?${prompt}
  11386: '...N-no...meow!${prompt}'
  11387: |-
    When will you everrr learn!?
    How many times do I have to scold you for the same thing!?
    You can't just take otherrr people's things! We've been over this!${prompt}
  11388: Do you have any idea how embarrrassing it is to have people think I raised a child who steals!?${prompt}
  11389: I-I'm sorry Mama! Meeeow!${prompt}
  11390: No more apologies! You know what to do! Turn arrround!${prompt}
  11391: Owwwwww! Meeeooow!${prompt}
  11392: Waaahhhhhh!${prompt}
  11393: Maybe you'll learrrn your lesson this time!${prompt}
  11394: Meeeooowww!!!${prompt}
  11395: You know what happens to bad little Mithrrra? They get left in Giddeus for the Yagudo to snack on!${prompt}
  11396: Noooooo! I-I'm sooorrry! Meeeooowww!${prompt}
  11397: You poor thing...${prompt}
  11398: |-
    Even though Kocco has stolen gems from my store before, I don't think she means any harm.
    I think maybe her pranks just get a little too far out of hand.${prompt}
  11399: Her mother is so busy-wusy with work that she's probably just lonely. Don't you think?${prompt}
  11400: Wahhh...meowww...${prompt}
  11401: Would you mind telling her mother that for her? I'll stay here and comfort her.${prompt}
  11402: Since her mother is a member of the Anacondas, she's most likely somewhere nearby.${prompt}
  11403: Mama... Meeeooow...${prompt}
  11404: Hm? Oh, it's you. What do you want?${prompt}
  11405: You saw all that, huh? It's so morrrtifying. To think my own child is a thief...${prompt}
  11406: Shairiri is so kind, she always says that she doesn't mind. But you've got to have discipline!${prompt}
  11407: I'm a mercenarrry. I never know when I will be called to battle, or when I may die at an enemy's hands.${prompt}
  11408: I rescued Kocco from the battlefield and took herrr in as my own. She has no family other than me...${prompt}
  11409: So I just want to preparrre her now to be able to live an honorable life, in case something should happen to me.${prompt}
  11410: <Sigh>... But the way things are now, my heart is so uneasy. I can't step onto the battlefield with confidence knowing she is not yet rrready.${prompt}
  11411: Hey, you seem like an adventurer who's been around and seen a few things.${prompt}
  11412: 'If you wouldn''t mind, do you think you could talk to her? I mean, tell her about how the world rrreally works and the hardships it contains? I would be in your debt.${prompt} '
  11413: Please, tell Kocco what a cruel and difficult place the world can be. I'd be most apprrreciative.${prompt}
  11414: Waaahhh! Meeeooowww! <Sniff>...${prompt}
  11415: She just won't stop crying. I don't know what else to do.${prompt}
  11416: Kocco, if you promise your mother that you won't steal anymore, I'm sure she'll forgive you.${prompt}
  11417: Waaahhh...<sniff>... But I need a gem...${prompt}
  11418: A gem...b-blue like the waters...f-from the land of the M-Mithrrra...${prompt}
  11419: Hmmm...well, I can't just give her one of my wares. What to do...${prompt}
  11420: Adventurer, if you should happen to find such a stone, would you be so kind as to bring it back for Kocco here?${prompt}
  11421: '...!${prompt}'
  11422: Pleeease, meow! Pleeease bring me a stone, meow!${prompt}
  11423: And then you'll promise to stop stealing things?${prompt}
  11424: Of courrrse!${prompt}
  11425: A blue stone... Hmmm, that could be a bit difficult...${prompt}
  11426: Such stones used to be found within Vunkerl Inlet, but the onset of war has...complicated things.${prompt}
  11427: Oh pleeease, brrring me a shiny blue stone from Vunkerrrl Inlet!${prompt}
  11428: Meow?${prompt}
  11429: Is...is that a shiny blue stone you have therrre? For me!?${prompt}
  11430: Meeeooow! Thank you so much!${prompt}
  11431: Nehehe! It should be finished by tomorrow! Meow!${prompt}
  11432: Well, that should keep you from upsetting your mother any further.${prompt}
  11433: Meow!${prompt}
  11434: Shairiri! Can you do me a favorrr?${prompt}
  11435: Hm? What is it?${prompt}
  11436: Nehehe! It should be finished by tomorrow! Meow!${prompt}
  11437: And then just do that...right there... That's it! All done!${prompt}
  11438: Meow! I did it!${prompt}
  11439: Oh, hello there! Well, it seems Kocco had an ulterior motive to wanting that stone after all. She--${prompt}
  11440: Kocco!${prompt}
  11441: What are you doing? You're not botherrring Shairiri again, are you?${prompt}
  11442: N-no, Mama! I swearrr!${prompt}
  11443: Go ahead. Show her, Kocco.${prompt}
  11444: Here, Mama. This is for you.${prompt}
  11445: Eh? A twinstone earring?${prompt}
  11446: No, it looks like one, but the stones are different. What is this?${prompt}
  11447: Since your work is always taking you to such dangerous places, I made this to help prrrotect you.${prompt}
  11448: Kocco...${prompt}
  11449: 'Shairiri and this adventurer were nice enough to help me.${prompt} '
  11450: I tried to make it look like a twinstone earring...but it didn't come out so well.${prompt}
  11451: |-
    Meow! I'll be here waiting for you whenever you're away.
    I promise I won't make you mad anymorrre.${prompt}
  11452: Just make sure that you come home safe...${prompt}
  11453: '......${prompt}'
  11454: I-I will... Th-thank you. I'll always keep it near.${prompt}
  11455: You don't have to worry about a thing. You of all people should know how strong and scarrry your mama can be.${prompt}
  11456: Nehehehe.${prompt}
  11457: Therrre's no way I can lose to the Yagudo with an earring as fine as this! I'll always come back safe to you, Kocco.${prompt}
  11458: Meow!${prompt}
  11459: Now that's special...${prompt}
  11460: She really is a wonderful child. What a relief!${prompt}
  11461: |-
    Ah, by the way. I was able to make this from what was left over from the stone you brought.
    I'd like you to have it, for your trouble.${prompt}
  11462: She was only worried about her mother all along. Who would have thought...${prompt}
  11463: Thank you so much for brrringing me that shiny stone! I wonder if it is keeping Mama safe...${prompt}
  11464: Urghhhhhh...${prompt}

  11508: |-
    Gimme that...... Hmmmmm......
    Kalsu-Kalasu! That meddling weasel. How many times have I told him that we don't need any more driveling peons cluttering our ranks and filling up on our ale...no offense, of course.${prompt}
  11509: On the other hand, we could always use an extra blade. Our feathered friends from the east have backed us into a corner and it'll take more than quaint pleasantries to get us out. What'd you say your name was again?${prompt}
  11510: Eh? You want to transfer to the Cobras? Damn allied armies... Whose brilliant idea was that...!?${prompt}
  11511: Come on soldier, speak up! What do they call you?${prompt}
  11512: ${name-player}... Doesn't sound too imposing, but I guess we have your mamma to blame for that, eh?${prompt}
  11513: Now listen up, 'cause I'm only gonna say this once. Just because some Taru playin' soldier in Rolanberry thinks you got what it takes, doesn't mean you get a free pass into the Cobras.${prompt}
  11514: You're gonna have to prove yourself before the boss'll even consider whether you're worthy to lick the dhalmel dung off her boots.${prompt}
  11515: You've seen all those towers in West Sarutabaruta, right? Well, according to the Tarus, they play an important role in defendin' the Federation.${prompt}
  11516: Problem is, they're older than the warts on my dead granddaddy's corpse, and a day don't go by when one or two of 'em up and stop runnin'.${prompt}

  11518: '${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  11519: Yeah, yeah. That crackpot name makes the bile in my gut churn, but what do you expect from a Taru?${prompt}
  11520: Anyway, I want you to take this concoction to at least three towers and seal up any cracks you can find.${prompt}
  11521: Why doesn't the Manustery do this themselves, you ask? Have you been to the Manustery? Those runts wouldn't last a second outside the city walls. That's why they hired us.${prompt}
  11522: And now the task has been passed on to you, rookie! You should be honored!${prompt}
  11523: It's not every day a commoner like you gets the opportunity to prove ${choice-player-gender}[himself/herself] to the Cobras. Don't let us down, ${name-player}...or you'll have me to answer to!${prompt}
  11524: If it isn't ${name-player}. I seem to remember the last time I laid eyes on your sorry face, you were cowering back to the hole you crawled out of. Don't tell me you're back for a second chance.${prompt}

    I'm not done just yet!
    I can't take this anymore!${prompt}

  11531: What took you so long? Zonpa was here hours ago thankin' us for a job well done.${prompt}
  11532: Well, I hate to admit it, but you proved yourself, ${name-player}.${prompt}

    Are you in?

    Of course, do I get anything?
    Sorry, but I'm having second thoughts.${prompt}

    Alright. I guess it's about time you met the boss. Hold on...

  11541: ${name-player}, eh? Looks kind of scrrrawny if you ask me. You called me all the way over here to waste my time with this?${prompt}
  11542: Uh... Sir, no sir, ma'am. I think this one may be different. I've already given ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] an assignment and ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] came through without any problems.${prompt}
  11543: Without any problems, you say?${prompt}
  11544: Well then. Let's see what you're worth...${prompt}
  11545: Wait... Have we met somewhere before? You look awfully familiarrr...${prompt}
  11546: Wh-wh-wh-what!?${prompt}
  11547: |-
    Eh, I might be wrong. You rrrookies all look the same.
    Anyway, good luck. But if I hear that you've disgraced the Cobra name, I'll personally make sure that there's not enough left of you to feed the carrion crrrows.${prompt}
  11548: And that goes for you too, Miah Riyuh. Your tail is riding on ${name-player}'s performance.${prompt}
  11549: Yes sir...ma'am!${prompt}

    Phew...
    What are you looking at!? Eager to get workin', are you?${prompt}

    Well, you're lookin' at the wrong girl.
    You see that Taru over there, Kolin-Olin? Ask him.${prompt}
  11552: |-
    Oh, and don't forget this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    It'll prrrove that you're fightin' on the right side. Check with Evaluation Official Llewellyn if you wanna know more.${prompt}
  11553: |-
    Now, I have more important things to be doin' than babysittin' new recruits.
    Try not to get yourself smeared under an Orcish warmachine.${prompt}

  11555: |-
    If it isn't ${name-player}! It's great to see you again!
    Now get out of my face before I decide to use your belly to test out my new knives.${prompt}

    Ah, you're both here.

    The reason I ask for your counsel is regarding the practically separate movements of the War Warlocks and the Mithra Mercenaries...
    This incident has convinced me of the need for a higher level of cooperation.${prompt}
  11695: |-
    Yes, I thought to suggest the very same thing.
    There is more that could be accomplished if we coordinate our efforts.${prompt}
  11696: There are more units arriving from the south every day, and we need organization to take full advantage of our strrrength.${prompt}
  11697: |-
    But until rrrecently, we hadn't even laid eyes on you.
    How do we know you can be trrrusted?${prompt}

    Just as your War Warlocks have their...way of doing things, the Mithra have their own style of battle.
    We're not here as your pet attack cats.${prompt}
  11699: I expected you to voice such doubts.${prompt}
  11700: I believe an audience with the Star Sibyl is in order...${prompt}
  11701: The boss was prrretty surprised to meet the Star Sibyl herself.${prompt}
  11702: |-
    It's that Warlock Warlord that surprrrises me, though.
    Did you see...those wrrrappings?${prompt}
  11703: |-
    Some say he was horribly injurrred in battle; others say he's worn the wrrrappings since birth.
    In any case, no one has ever seen his face!${prompt}
  11704: |-
    He goes to any length to claim victory, and often takes the field himself.
    His allies seem to fear him almost as much as his enemies...${prompt}
  11705: Why would the Parliament of Patrrriarchs elect such a sinister figure...?${prompt}
  11706: Ajido-Marujido!${prompt}

    Looking to join the Fighting Fourth?

  11732: If you seek to regain admission to the Knights of the Iron Ram, you must first sever ties with your nation of allegiance...and that will require Allied Notes.${prompt}
  11733: Though if you want to rejoin the fourth, I think something can be worked out. You have some Allied Notes, don't you?${prompt}
  11734: But if you've finally come to your senses and decided to return to the Cobras, I think I can pull a few strings...for a price. You're carrying Allied Notes, right?${prompt}

    Campaign tallies.

    Upon entering into an alliance with one another, the four nations drew up a wartime pact.
    In accordance with the stipulations therein, the single nation deemed to be the greatest contributor to the fighting within, or maintaining of, an area is temporarily granted domain over it. ${prompt}
  11831: Such rulings are doled outaru by the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, in all its wisdom, based on the intel reports of Campaign officials. Those reports as a whole are commonly referred to as “Campaign tallies.”${prompt}
  11832: "From what I've seen, the fighting is usually at its most vehement-wehement just before Campaign tallies. \nThat's because it's widely known that when influence over an area changes, crucial factors such as funds and resources are also affected.\nNot to mention the role it plays in boosting or lowering an army's spirits!${prompt}"
  11833: That's why things tend to get a little hectic on the frontarulines when a Campaign tally draws near.${prompt}
  11834: |-
    Which statistic interests you?
    ${selection-lines}
    Funds.
    Resources.
    Supplies.
    Reconnaissance.
    Skill.
    Production.
    Morale.
    Prosperity.
    Go back.
    Quit.${prompt}
  11835: |-
    “Funds” is a self-explanatory term.
    As you may have guessed, it means all of the money which a nation has to dedicate to its war endeavors.${prompt}
  11836: |-
    The importance of money in war is difficult to overstate.
    Greater funds allow a nation to plan and carry out attacks, increase the number of troops available for dispatch, and even step up the quality of gear with which it outfits its units.${prompt}
  11837: |-
    Funds decrease whenever a Campaign battle occurs.
    Most people don't seem to know this, but offensive and defensive battles tend to cost roughly the same amountaru.${prompt}
  11838: |-
    A nation's wartime coffers also have a direct influence on their supply stores.
    When funds get too low, supplies will start to be sold off by the government to compensate.${prompt}
  11839: |-
    Oh, and additional-witional funds are rewarded whenever influence over an area is gained.
    So it would be wise to keep an eye outaru just before and after Campaign tallies.${prompt}
  11840: |-
    I don't think I need to tell you that the more areas a nation controls, the more funds it will collect.
    Also, the amount rewarded varies from area to area.${prompt}
  11841: |-
    Other means for increasing funds exist as well. For example, by maintaining a high level of “prosperity.”
    After all, if a nation does good by its people, it follows that their economic endeavors will benefit.${prompt}
  11842: |-
    Well, you could learn any of what I've just told you from your run-of-the-mill military textbook.
    But, here's a little secret of mine. I've observed that achievements in a certain group of Campaign Ops serve to raise a nation's funds.
    But now I've gone and said too much! No good teacher divulges her students all the answers!${prompt}
  11843: '${color-alt: 121}Your nation''s funds may be checked by talking to an appropriate Campaign NPC in the capital. Available information is dependent on current reconnaissance ranking.'
  11844: “Resources” are the strategic material reserves of a nation that allow it to conduct military operations.${prompt}
  11845: |-
    And just so you don'taru get confused, allow me to clarify-warify. I'm not referring here to the resources of a single stronghold, mind you.
    Rather, this is an index of the resources of an entire nation.${prompt}
  11846: In addition to being used to increase an army's supplies, resource stockpiles are also depleted by offensive undertakings and certain Campaign Ops.${prompt}
  11847: |-
    What's more, they also have a directaru influence over wartime funds.
    As reason entails, insufficient resources require thataru a nation spend a little cash to purchase that which it lacks.${prompt}
  11848: |-
    A nation's resources are regularly replenished based on the areas under its influence.
    So the times just prior-wior to and just after a Campaign tally are especially crucial.${prompt}
  11849: |-
    The more areas a nation controls, the more resources it can procure.
    And certain areas are capable of rendering more resources than others.${prompt}
  11850: |-
    And just between you and me, my studies indicate that achievements in certain Campaign Ops are directly linked to resource procurement.
    Well, that's wartime resources in a nutshell!${prompt}
  11851: '${color-alt: 121}Your nation''s resources may be checked by talking to an appropriate Campaign NPC in the capital. Available information is dependent on current reconnaissance ranking.'
  11852: |-
    “Supplies” are the military-wilitary goods used to effectively sustain a war: equipment, sundries, rations, and the like.
    Nations produce these by expending their resources. You mightaru hear them categorically referred to as “temporary items.”${prompt}
  11853: Nations rich in supplies are able to better provide their strongholds with much-needed equipment and items directly from the capital.${prompt}
  11854: Supply expenditure goes towards such activities as stronghold maintenance, outarufitting troops, and conducting certain Campaign Ops.${prompt}
  11855: |-
    The amount of supplies at a nation's disposal is inextricably linked to its resources as well.
    After all, using resources implies that supply production is underway.${prompt}
  11856: |-
    A nation's supplies are compounded regularly based on the areas under its influence.
    So always try and keep an eye out just before and after Campaign tallies.${prompt}
  11857: |-
    Increases in supplies are naturally larger for nations with more areas under their control.
    And different areas generate varying-warying amountarus of supplies.${prompt}
  11858: |-
    The total amount of supplies a nation can manufacture is heavily influenced by its production.
    But that's another lecture all in itself!${prompt}
  11859: |-
    I've got it by a pretty good source that carrying out certain Campaign Ops serves to increase a nation's supplies.
    Well, that should do just fine by way of an introduction.${prompt}
  11860: '${color-alt: 121}Your nation''s supplies may be checked by talking to an appropriate Campaign NPC in the capital. Available information is dependent on current reconnaissance ranking.'
  11861: “Reconnaissance” is an index of an army's intel. That is to say, how far their intelligence network extends.${prompt}
  11862: High reconnaissance means that a nation is better able to ascertain the most up-to-date info on the movementarus and machinations of both friend and foe.${prompt}
  11863: |-
    By now I hope you've seen the intelligence-welligence reports available from the Campaign deputies located in the nations' capitals.
    The more advanced reconnaissance is, the more detailed those reports will be.${prompt}
  11864: There are a number of intel-gathering Campaign Ops in which achievement will serve to improve reconnaissance.${prompt}
  11865: |-
    And just like other Campaign statistics, this one changes whenever a Campaign tally is conducted.
    But don't worry--so far I've yet to see a nation's reconnaissance plummet to zero.
    Still, it is ever wise to keep close tabs on your enemies, as well as your allies.${prompt}
  11866: '${color-alt: 121}Your nation''s reconnaissance may be checked by talking to an appropriate Campaign NPC in the capital. Available information is dependent on current reconnaissance ranking.'
  11867: “Skill” denotes technological development, and manifestarus itself in the ability-wility to produce high-end equipment and weaponry.${prompt}
  11868: |-
    Advancing skill ensures a nation will churn out cutting-edge gear to supply its frontlines.
    It is also required for the construction-wuction of siege equipment.${prompt}
  11869: |-
    Still, all the technological skill in the world is useless withoutaru the funds to back it up.
    Production costs money, silly.${prompt}
  11870: |-
    What's that? How do you go about improving your nation's skill?
    Well, I reckon the “troop training” Campaign Ops would be a good place to start.${prompt}
  11871: |-
    Just to be clear, “skill” indicates the quality of supplies that can be turned out.
    “Production,” on the other hand, refers to the quantity of supplies that a nation is capable of generating.
    Did I just blow your mind? Confusing, I know, but do try and see the difference.${prompt}
  11872: '${color-alt: 121}Your nation''s skill may be checked by talking to an appropriate Campaign NPC in the capital. Available information is dependent on current reconnaissance ranking.'
  11873: |-
    “Production” is the ability to, well, produce anything that needs...producing.
    This can be items, armor, weapons, you name itaru!${prompt}
  11874: |-
    And the name of the game is efficiency-wiciency!
    High production enables a nation to generate more supplies from less resources. If that isn't win-win, I don't know what is!${prompt}
  11875: Alas, even otherworldly production will be utterly useless without a healthy amount of resources to drive it.${prompt}
  11876: To that end, the nations have all organized the so-called “supply manufacture” operations, such as codename “Crystal Fist” and others.${prompt}
  11877: '${color-alt: 121}Your nation''s production may be checked by talking to an appropriate Campaign NPC in the capital. Available information is dependent on current reconnaissance ranking.'
  11878: “Morale” will give you an idea of how eager-weager for battle an army is.${prompt}
  11879: |-
    High morale allows an army to carry out successive attacks with only short respites in between.
    Nothing screams victory like an army that loves to fightaru!${prompt}
  11880: |-
    Morale is an extremely dynamic factor in any war--as capricious as the hearts of the men it occupies.
    Fluctuations are heavily dependent on victory and defeataru in Campaign battles.${prompt}
  11881: |-
    That being said, it is obvious to see how it is directly related to both offensive and defensive operations.
    It's a pretty simple thing, morale. That's really all there is to it.${prompt}
  11882: '${color-alt: 121}A nation''s morale may be checked from the Region Info menu''s Campaign map. Simply move the cursor over a capital''s symbol to display the information.'
  11883: |-
    Ahhh, “prosperity.” Another of war's fickle-wickle mistresses.
    Plainly put, this is the degree to which a nation's people trustaru in their governing body.${prompt}
  11884: High prosperity works wonders for economic growth, which in turn means more duties, tariffs, and so on. In a word, funds!${prompt}
  11885: |-
    Prosperity is in a constantaru state of flux based on the outcome of Campaign battles.
    And rightly so, as people can not hope to prosper should they feel constantly threatened.${prompt}
  11886: |-
    To ensure the welfare of their citizenry, the alliance has established “security” Campaign Ops.
    These are effective in setting the minds of the people-weople at ease. Not a whole lotaru more to say about it.${prompt}
  11887: '${color-alt: 121}A nation''s prosperity may be checked from the Region Info menu''s Campaign map. Simply move the cursor over a capital''s symbol to display the information.'
  11888: |-
    Which terminology will you ask about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Fortifications.
    Maximum fortifications.
    Resources.
    Maximum Resources.
    Influence.
    Heroism Gauge.
    Go back.
    Quit.${prompt}
  11889: |-
    “Fortifications” represent the strength of a military force garrisoned at a stronghold.
    It is depleted when soldiers stationed there are defeated, or when the structural integrity of the stronghold itself is damaged directly-wectly.${prompt}
  11890: A Campaign battle is deemed a defeataru by High Command should the fortifications fall below a pre-established amount.${prompt}
  11891: So, stronghold fortifications in areas constantly plagued by heavy combat must be vigorously-wigorously maintained.${prompt}
  11892: |-
    There are three ways of bolstering fortifications to facilities which have been compromised.
    First, you can simply waitaru for the injured soldiers to recover. This method, however, requires a considerable amount of time.${prompt}
  11893: |-
    Second, you can wait for engineers to arrive and start rebuilding.
    For your nation, I believe that task falls within the jurisdiction-wiction of the ${choice: 0}[Knights of the Gold Badger/Fourth Division/Piscean War Warlocks].${prompt}
  11894: |-
    Lastly, you can supplementaru the garrison by sending reinforcements.
    Successful completion of the “Vanguard-X” Campaign Ops will help refortify a war-torn stronghold.${prompt}
  11895: |-
    Keep in mind, though, that a lack of funds will limitaru the number of forces available-wailable for dispatch.
    Which means that ultimately, fortifications will suffer. A war machine without money is akin to a lion without claws, I'm afraid.${prompt}
  11896: '${color-alt: 121}A stronghold''s fortifications may be checked from the Region Info menu''s Campaign map. Simply move the cursor over a position to display the information. The number on the left is the current value, while the number on the right is the maximum available.'
  11897: The total number of troops that a stronghold is capable of housing-wousing is referred to as its “maximum fortifications” ranking.${prompt}
  11898: |-
    And it is just that. The absolute upper limit on the size of a stronghold's garrison.
    Regardless of a nation's funds or achievements, defensive capabilities can never go above this amountaru.${prompt}
  11899: The other side of that coin is this. No matter how great a stronghold's maximum fortifications may be, without adequate-wadequate funds, it will lack the soldiers required to realize that potential. ${prompt}
  11900: |-
    What's that? Ahhh, you catch on quick. Yes, the maximum fortifications rank can indeed be raised.
    This is accomplished via-wia achievements in any of the “Steel Resolve“ operations.${prompt}
  11901: |-
    But remember this: all participants in this war, both friend and foe, have their own unique ways of reducing maximum fortifications as well.
    Specifically...${prompt}
  11902: '...Well, you''ll just have to mull that one over by yourself. Can''t give up all my secret-wecrets!${prompt}'
  11903: '${color-alt: 121}A stronghold''s fortifications may be checked from the Region Info menu''s Campaign map. Simply move the cursor over a position to display the information. The number on the left is the current value, while the number on the right is the maximum available.'
  11904: |-
    Alrightaru, this might be a bit confusing at first for the uninitiated, but do try to keep up.
    A local area's “resources” rating refers to the resource and supply stockpiles located at the stronghold.${prompt}
  11905: This is a local-wocal rating, and separate altogether from the overall resource rating of an entire nation, mind you.${prompt}
  11906: |-
    The more battles a stronghold endures, the more depletion its resource stockpiles will suffer.
    You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs. And war is such a tasty omelettaru!${prompt}
  11907: Local resources are consumed whenever temporary-wary items are dispensed to soldiers for defensive operations.${prompt}
  11908: |-
    You would do well to remember that the “Crimson Domino” Ops are integral in this respectaru.
    Seeing those supply convoys safely to their destinations will do wonders for replenishing stronghold resources.${prompt}
  11909: 'For your nation, such duties are traditionally-witionally taken up by the ${choice: 0}[/Knights of the Gold Badger/Fourth Division/Piscean War Warlocks].${prompt}'
  11910: |-
    Now try and wrap your mind around this!
    If the national resource and supply stockpiles are not maintained, there simply won't be enough surplus to bolster-wolster local stockpiles.
    Surely you can see the logic in this.${prompt}
  11911: '${color-alt: 121}An area''s resources may be checked from the Region Info menu''s Campaign map. Simply move the cursor over a position to display the information. The number on the left is the current value, while the number on the right is the maximum available.'
  11912: The limitaru placed on the greatest amount of resources a stronghold can store before literally-witerally bursting is known as its “maximum resources” ranking.${prompt}
  11913: No matter how much surplus in resources and supplies a nation might have, the local stronghold limitation-wations cannot be exceeded.${prompt}
  11914: '${color-alt: 121}The local resources of an area may be checked from the Region Info menu''s Campaign map.'

  11916: “Influence” is used to convey how much control each competing-weting power has over a given area.${prompt}
  11917: |-
    There is a total of four powers in all, which you should well know by now.
    The Beastman Confederate, on the one hand, and each of the nations of the Allied Forces, excluding Jeuno, on the other.${prompt}
  11918: So, what happens is that following the results of the latest Campaign tally-wally, control of an area is relegated to the power which currently exertarus the most influence over it.${prompt}
  11919: |-
    Your nation will gain a bit of influence in an area every time you defeat an enemy there.
    By the same token, loss at the hands of the beastman will result in their influence rising.${prompt}
  11920: |-
    In the worst-case scenario, beastman influence will grow so profound that High Command will cut their losses and issue a strategic withdrawal.
    In other words, the area falls under beastman control.${prompt}
  11921: Each nation then abandon-wandons any interests they had in that area, after which the beastmen typically move in droves to solidify their claim.${prompt}
  11922: '${color-alt: 121}The influences vying for control of an area may be checked from the Region Info menu''s Campaign map.'
  11923: |-
    An excellent inquiry! The “heroism gauge” is still a fledgling theory in military scholastic-wastic circles.
    Only in recentaru years was it proposed to and adopted by Allied Forces High Command.${prompt}
  11924: |-
    Not to brag, but it was actually I who developed the final theory.
    So, who better to explain it to you than the very Tarutaru who named it?${prompt}
  11925: |-
    It occurred to me that any battlefield is, by definition, replete with a certain... How shall I put this?
    An air of intensity, an almost tangible, adrenaline-induced furor. No doubt this is broughtaru about by the teetering-weetering of lives in the balance.${prompt}
  11926: |-
    The inquisitive scholar in me wondered if this phenomenon could not somehow be gauged and expressed numerically.
    This was the hypothesis with which I set out to develop-welop my theory.${prompt}
  11927: Based on my thorough observations, I found that for every battle which took place in the subject area, my measurementarus would increase substantially.${prompt}
  11928: |-
    And then my most startling discovery!
    Without fail, when my heroism gauge would approach its peak, battles would reach near astronomical-womical proportions!
    Beastman and ally, general and freelance. All come calling when the war fervor hails, lusting to claim their place in legend and song!${prompt}
  11929: |-
    And what dramatic-watic battles they were! I have witnessed cataclysmic exchanges, over in the blink of an eye.
    Disastrous battles where the thirst for blood conquers reason, and countless throngs of haphazardly formed ranks throw themselves headlong into one another.${prompt}
  11930: At the suggestion of my fellow scholars, my findings are now being made known to all member nations of the alliance-wiance.${prompt}
  11931: |-
    In truth, it is still an unfinished theory, and there are many elementarus to be worked out.
    My hope is that it will serve to help us better comprehend the finer details of the flow of war.${prompt}
  11932: '${color-alt: 121}An area''s heroism gauge may be checked from the Region Info menu''s Campaign map. Simply move the cursor over a position and the gauge will be displayed directly above or below the area name.'

    What would you like to know about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Resource procurement.
    Supply transport.
    Security.
    Supply manufacture.
    Offensive operations.
    Defensive operations.
    Intel gathering.
    Military training.
    Achievements.
    Go back.
    Quit.${prompt}
  11934: As their name implies, achievements in Campaign Ops classified as “resource procurement” will result in direct augmentation to your nation's resource and supply stockpile-wiles.${prompt}
  11935: More specifically, codename “Stock and Awe” was designed with the aim of securing resources, while codename “Materiel Storm” was planned for the sole purpose of amassing supplies.${prompt}
  11936: Should supplies startaru to become meager, units will be unable to carry out their orders to completion, and other Campaign Ops will fall into arrears.${prompt}
  11937: |-
    If a nation's resources begin to wane, production suffers and the number of supplies declines.
    Any way you slice it, a logistic bottleneck at any pointaru along the line spells an absolute nightmare for a warring nation.${prompt}
  11938: Immediately following Campaign tally-wallies is when allotments of resources and supplies are carried out.${prompt}
  11939: The unfortunate corollary to that, however, is that just prior to Campaign tallies is when stockpiles are at their lowestaru.${prompt}
  11940: |-
    Which is why, to answer your initial inquiry, resource procurement is so significant-wificant.
    Their appeal lies in the fact that when successfully completed, resource and supply stockpiles receive immediate benefits.${prompt}
  11941: |-
    Many military scholars even go so far as to refer to these operations as the prime movers of the allied effort.
    Perhaps the most integral of cogs at the very heartaru of the entire war machine.${prompt}
  11942: “Supply transport” refers to those military operation-wations whereby resources and supplies are seen safely to the strongholds that need them.${prompt}
  11943: |-
    There are varying operations with varying resultarus, so allow me to expand.
    Codename “Vanguard-X” solidifies stronghold fortifications by dispatching manpower, whereas codename “Crimson Domino” aims to replenish local resources via convoy-wonvoy deliveries.${prompt}
  11944: The reasoning behind their importance is thus. Goddess forbid, should the fortifications or local resources of a stronghold become inadequate, the position will simply be overrun by the beastmen. They have a wicked talentaru for sniffing out such weaknesses.${prompt}
  11945: Of course, no nation simply leaves any stronghold to vie for itself. There are regular-wegular dispatches of both men and material from the capitals. But my experience tells me that these are more protocol than pragmatism, and rarely reflectaru the latest wartime developments.${prompt}
  11946: |-
    And that is where you vaga--valiant adventurers come in!
    Your freedoms allow you the unique ability to continually adapt to the situation at hand without heeding to anachronistic protocol-wotocol.
    Keeping an ear to the ground and conducting supply transport at a vital moment might just make you the white knight of some desperate garrison!${prompt}
  11947: |-
    “Security” is that oft-overlooked category of operations which deals with seeing to the safety and welfare of a nation's citizenry.
    High Command implemented these ops for their role in increasing both prosperity-werity and the maximum fortifications.${prompt}
  11948: Successful completion of operations codenamed “Streetsweeper” and “Delta Strike” boost prosperity among the people.${prompt}
  11949: |-
    Nations with low prosperity often fall victim to stagnating-wating economies, ultimately resulting in lack of funds and fiscal woes.
    You can't expect people to get a good night's sleep and put in an honest day's work without providing a little homeland security.${prompt}
  11950: Codename “Steel Resolve” is another security-based operation which bolsters the maximum fortifications of an allied stronghold.${prompt}
  11951: |-
    The idea is to outfitaru positions with enhanced structural integrity to better withstand relentless-wentless beastman assaults.
    This is especially vital in heavily contested areas.${prompt}
  11952: “Supply manufacture” operations provide the opportunity for a nation to bring about improvements in the arena-wenas of technology and industry.${prompt}
  11953: Operations codenamed “Crystal Fist” and “Iron Anvil” were planned with the goal of marked advancements in skill and production, respectively.${prompt}
  11954: |-
    Higher skill permits a nation's engineers to develop higher quality equipmentaru and weaponry.
    Its benefits on local fields of battle are undeniable.${prompt}
  11955: |-
    When production is streamlined, mass production becomes possible-wossible.
    This has far-reaching effects for a nation's Campaign battles regardless of the location.${prompt}
  11956: So, if you happen to fancy yourself adept at synthesis and know your craftarus, these just might be the operations for you.${prompt}
  11957: The successful completion of “offensive operations” will result in palpable-walpable increases in both morale and funds.${prompt}
  11958: These ops include codename “Smokescreen,” “Pit Spider,” “By Light of Fire,” or any of the regional operations targeting specific beastman leaders. All of these will serve to boostaru an army's morale.${prompt}
  11959: On top of that, achievements in this arena will also bring in funds.${prompt}
  11960: |-
    Alas, as all things in war, there is a double-edge to this blade.
    Should you seek to defeat enemy leaders via operations codenamed “Splitting Heirs,” “Cracking Shells,” or “Plucking Wings” and suffer defeataru, the beastmen armies will be those shouting and raising their banners in triumph.${prompt}
  11961: Lastly, it would be remiss of me not to mention that offensive operations do require the expenditure-wenditure of supplies.${prompt}
  11962: “Defensive operations” can be extremely productive, as they help to increase not only prosperity-werity amongst the people, but also the reserves of resources and supplies as well.${prompt}
  11963: You will see immediate and obvious returns in the prosperity of your citizenry from your exploitarus in operations codenamed “Aegis Scream” and “Granite Rose.”${prompt}
  11964: A byproductaru of this is a healthy boost to the national intake of resources and supplies.${prompt}
  11965: |-
    Carrying out defensive operations will require that you expend some of your supplies in the process-wocess, though.
    Nothing in war is free, after all, save mayhap the glory.${prompt}
  11966: A personal favorite of mine and one I cannot stress the importance-wortance of enough, “intel gathering”!${prompt}
  11967: |-
    Espionage in all forms requires stealth and savvy, cunning and courage.
    Operations codenamed “Hawk Eye” and “Deep Cover” may place you in clear and present danger, but they will also increase your army's reconnaissance and place knowledge at its fingertips.${prompt}
  11968: |-
    Nations are also always looking for the mostaru intrepid of souls to undertake operation codename “Slaughterhouse.”
    A favorite of High Command, this pinpoint espionage weakens the beastman intelligence network from within, reducing their reconnaissance capabilities.${prompt}
  11969: |-
    No nation would deign to send such dauntless-wauntless volunteers into the field unequipped.
    And that is why intel gathering taxes an army's supplies.${prompt}
  11970: “Military training” is useful in preparing your troops for battle by both hardening their resolve and honing-woning their abilities.${prompt}
  11971: Operation codename “Brave Dawn” increases an army's capacity for waging war, while codename “Cut and Cauterize” improves the performance of its physicians.${prompt}
  11972: All of those training materials have to come from somewhere, though. Which is why military-wary training ops will cost you supplies.${prompt}
  11973: |-
    According to Raine--I mean...looks like rain today, no?
    Anyway, this information is based on firstaru-person accounts from a fairly reliable-wiable source.${prompt}
  11974: Campaign tallies record these so-called achievements for each category of operations.${prompt}
  11975: Achievementarus will naturally rise every time a Campaign operation is carried out to completion.${prompt}
  11976: The changes in factors such as resources, funds, and morale resulting from Campaign tallies are directly influenced by the achievements in correlated ops categories.${prompt}
  11977: In addition, stellar-wellar achievements in any single category pave the way for related, higher-level operations to become available.${prompt}
  11978: But try to be mindful of the current objectives of your army, as this effectarus availability as well.${prompt}
  11979: What I mean to say is, even for equivalent achievements, there are times when High Command will make an operation readily available, and other times when they will not.${prompt}
  11980: |-
    Changes in achievements are reflected in every Campaign tally, and have an effect on stockpile-wiles as well.
    Luckily, in all my days, I have never seen an achievement's value drop suddenly to zero.${prompt}
  11981: |-
    Every nation conducts its own “opinion polls.”
    Have you happened to come across any of the official-wicials recording the opinions of soldiers and adventurers?
    Those would be the pollers.${prompt}
  11982: In my opinion, those who frequent the frontlines such as yourself should make better use of the polls.${prompt}
  11983: |-
    Each nation has its own characteristic protocol based on long-standing established policies.
    Should polls not be made use of, the powers that be will have no choice but to rely upon their generals for counsel.${prompt}
  11984: |-
    Which might not necessarily-warily always be a bad thing, except that counsel may not always be based on the latest intel.
    I myself have witnessed offenses ordered with no supply lines or funds to back them, and entire units resting on their laurels at the most opportune times to attack.${prompt}
  11985: |-
    This is the river that opinion polls can help to ford!
    They allow High Command to know which generals have the supportaru of war-seasoned veterans, and provide a forum for the submission of strategies and feedback.${prompt}
  11986: |-
    I have always been an advocate of compulsory-wulsory polls. Think of it!
    If all soldiers from the frontlines raised their voices, High Command would have no choice but to listen.${prompt}
  11987: And consequently, more operations would become available in the category deemed to be most necessary at that time!${prompt}
  11988: |-
    Sorry, I always get a but flustered talking about this.
    Anyway, the reviewing of poll resultarus is conducted regularly, much like Campaign tallies.${prompt}
  11989: |-
    Hm? You don't know what opinion you should have?
    Well, that's just sad. Your opinions will come to you, so long as you keep a healthy skepticism and a critical-witical eye about you.${prompt}
  11990: To give a brief example, if you are of the mind that it is time for an all-outaru offensive, then you should consider raising your voice in favor of a “preemptive strike” or “diversionary tactics.”${prompt}
  11991: If you think the situation-wation calls for patience and caution, then perhaps cast your vote for “battleline preservation” or “stronghold defenses.”${prompt}
  11992: It might be easiestaru to think of all of the options broken into two fundamental categories of offense and defense.${prompt}
  11993: Rather than constantly worrying about maintaining a healthy balance of the two, there are times when a full frontal-wontal assault is required. Other times are best served by turtling up in strongholds and allowing wave after wave of beastmen to break upon your defenses.${prompt}
  11994: If you can absorb everything I've taughtaru you, and just use your head, I guarantee the path to victory will present itself to you as clear as day! That's the Maruna-Kurina guarantee!${prompt}
  11995: |-
    Oh and uhhh, if you ever happen to...well, gain an audience-waudience with any, say, importantaru people...
    Be sure to tell them that Maruna-Kurina helped you out!${prompt}

    I'm assuming by now that you've heard of the roaming-woaming mercenaries referred to as “freelances,” yes?
    They value nothing more than their freedom, which is all well and good, but in the worstaru of times they may be swayed into arms against the Allied Forces.${prompt}
  11999: |-
    As a genius military tactician, I cannot ignore the potential strength that these freelances are capable of lending an army.
    And it was this realization which acted as an impetus to my further studying the freelance subculture.${prompt}
  12000: |-
    Recruiting a freelance to fight for your cause is a technique commonly known as “headhunting.”
    Through my research, I have come to develop and map out a comprehensive psychology underlying the entire process-wocess!${prompt}
  12001: Each freelance maintains a certain degree of “loyalty” towards every great power.${prompt}
  12002: Whenever a headhunter actively pursues a freelance and attempts to win their favor, their loyalty towards thataru nation will rise.${prompt}
  12003: At the time of a Campaign tally, the freelances will realign themselves with the nation with whom they share the strongestaru bond.${prompt}
  12004: The trick to headhunting, then, is to try and become the nation a freelance holds dearest-wearest in his, her, or its heart of hearts.${prompt}
  12005: Many freelances will even cast aside their disdain for city walls, and take up arms beside you within the very capital!${prompt}
  12006: And being the capricious beings that they are, freelances will always be willing to entertain your proposals, even if they have currently pledged their fealty-wealty elsewhere.${prompt}
  12007: |-
    Of course, if you begin to neglectaru them once winning them to your side, don't be surprised if they place their loyalties elsewhere.
    There's got to be an appropriate saying for that, I'm sure...${prompt}
  12008: |-
    That's just the way they are. I've heard tales you wouldn't believe.
    From stories of nations' coffers swelling inexplicably after taking on resourceful freelances...${prompt}
  12009: '...to bold-hearted heroes inspiring troops and bolstering an entire nation''s morale!${prompt}'
  12010: Cloak-and-dagger freelances who assist in intel gathering, and questionable black market dealer-wealers who can always get their hands on sorely needed supplies. You name it, and there's a freelance out there who can, and has, done itaru!${prompt}
  12011: Now I know what you're thinking. With allegiances constantly in flux, who in Goddess's name is going to be able to keep track of it all!?${prompt}
  12012: You're looking at him! That's right, I have made it my personal-wersonal crusade to track the loyalties of all freelances as part of my research. And naturally, I will be making my findings available to the alliance's intelligence network.${prompt}
  12013: |-
    At any rate, do try and give the freelances as warm a reception as possible whenever you happen across them.
    Your nation, and the Allied Forces as a whole, can only benefitaru in the long run.${prompt}
  12014: '${color-alt: 121}Successfully headhunting Maruna-Kurina will allow you to ask him directly about freelances, including their current loyalties and other detailed information.'

    He's a sucker for high morale, and can barely contain himself once the conversation-wation turns to the topic of war.
    They say battle fever is contagious, you know. And he's always willing to talk it up with a fellow monk.${prompt}

    Good Rainemard once belonged to the Order of the Temple Knights. For a time, we were classmates together in our studies at the academy.
    N-n-not that I consider him a scholarly rival-wival or anything like thataru!${prompt}
  12022: |-
    The last time I saw him he claimed he was heading to Jugner Forest to escape the hustle-bustle of the city.
    I only pray he didn't go poking his nose around where it didn't belong again...${prompt}
  12023: |-
    If he's still the same old Rainemard, I suppose he still enjoys talking it up with other red mages.
    He also has an adorable-worable little daughter, and he loves to go on and on about her...incessantly.${prompt}
  12024: Oh, you've heard of Maat? A regular living legend, that one. He's been living in Jeuno since it was no more than a flyspeck of a fishing village-willage. They say he's mastered every form of combataru there is!${prompt}
  12025: |-
    I've run into him before in North Gustaberg. But rumor has it he is in charge of some very important tasks back at the Grand Duchy.
    I wonder how he finds the time to go for leisurely strolls so far away...${prompt}
  12026: |-
    He has a rival too, you know? What was his name again... Hegen...no...Degenhard! That's it!
    He's been known to wreak havoc-wavoc on the battlefield every now and then.${prompt}
  12027: He loves collecting those ancient papyrus testimonies, no matter what variety. He also has a penchantaru for ambitious souls, and is said to dote on those who have mastered three or more paths of their own.${prompt}
  12028: They call Azima the “Hermitess of the Highlands,” and she is almost universally-wersally regarded as the most skilled and feared bounty hunter in Vana'diel. It's not uncommon to glimpse her from time to time in North Gustaberg.${prompt}
  12029: |-
    As of late they say she is utterly obsessed with all things alchemy.
    Those in the know will be the first to tell you, Azima is one best keptaru in good graces.${prompt}
  12030: |-
    “Venomous Verminess,” “Baroness of Bugdom,” Choh Moui has almost as many monikers as she does pet pestarus.
    She's a Mithran beastmaster-waster who got her come-uppings in the south, but now makes her home in Crawler's Nest.${prompt}
  12031: I'm not entirely sure of the reasons behind it, but they say she is in regular contactaru with a mercenary by the name of Duskraven.${prompt}
  12032: She's accredited with inventing the pet foods now used by beastmasters the world round, and is always eagerly to get her hands on ingredients. She also loves to have others save her the hassle-wassle of rounding up her pets for her. What could she be up to...?${prompt}
  12033: Perchance you've already espied him before. Rongo-Nango is that adorable little Tarutaru beastmaster who's always in the vicinity-winity of Fort Karugo-Narugo. He's absolutely infatuated with Lungo-Nango, the great warlord and tactician of Windurstian history.${prompt}
  12034: After opposing the Parliament of Patriarchs, Lungo-Nango fell into disrepute and spentaru the remainder of his days in isolation and depression. For that reason, Rongo-Nango holds much of Windurst in contempt, and refuses to lay his loyalties with the Federation.${prompt}
  12035: I've come to find out that he is quite fond of calling his beasts, and is also looking for more of the material-warials he needs to do so.${prompt}

    Ulla is a mysterious young girl. They say she bore witness to a divine revelation, and now wanders Vana'diel as a pilgrim-wilgrim knight.

    Her devoted attendantaru Kilhwch is ever by her side, and carries with him the renowned sword ${item-singular: 0[2]}.
    The thing is, he's a celebrated knight in his own right, giving many rise to wonder what could have caused him to pledge his fealty to another.${prompt}

    Achtelle is a young Elvaan wyverness from Adoulin Isle to the west, the proud keeper-weepers of the last of the dragoon tradition.
    The draketamers there herald her as the most skilled of their order.${prompt}
  12040: Since youth, she has held the legendary Ranperre of San d'Oria in highestaru esteem, and can oft be found seeking solace near his tomb.${prompt}
  12041: |-
    I can promise you she would eagerly accept any type of present related to the king she so reveres.
    I hear it told she longs for nothing more than to find some surviving-wiving dragoons, that they might together preserve their heritage.${prompt}
  12042: |-
    Duskraven is a sullen, grim-faced mercenary, distinguishable by his ominous-wominous greatsword, “Kyomon.”
    Wayfarers and soldiers alike often recount seeing him in the vicinity of Batallia Downs, but for what purpose and to whataru end, none can say.${prompt}
  12043: His underlings, the Dusk Raiders, answer to his beck and call, and such powers lead many to surmise that he is no stranger to the nether-wether realms.${prompt}
  12044: |-
    He is a straight shooter, though. If you hope to curry favor with him, you need nothing more than cold cash.
    He seems to blow right through it as soon as he gets it, and is always looking for more. What he spends itaru on, I couldn't say.${prompt}
  12045: |-
    Many have seen this fair young Elvaan maid walking undeterred amongst the now hostile-wostile grounds of Grauberg.
    All who gaze upon her tell of her godlike aura and stunning beauty.${prompt}
  12046: |-
    Word has it that she is of frail constitution, and grants her favor on those gracious enough to spare her medicines.
    I myself went and bestowed such gifts upon her, and can attest to the truth of itaru.${prompt}
  12047: |-
    She is also known to dote upon those who take up the defense of her Grauberg.
    Some of her more fanatic-watic fans are said to be providing her with an enormous quantity of a certain item...${prompt}
  12048: |-
    When her loyalties are won, the men speak of a giant wyrm which takes to the battlefield!
    Such heated talk--no doubt itaru would be wise to mind the heroism gauge should you want to catch a glimpse for yourself.${prompt}
  12049: Titania is the name of the celebrated Queen of Pixies from the classic Bastokan drama, “Midwinter Dream.”${prompt}
  12050: |-
    Of course, that is no more than a tale of fantasy to delight children. We all know that pixies don't exist in the real--
    What!? You've seen one? Are you having a jape at my expense!?${prompt}
  12051: |-
    Well, what I do know for certain-wertain is this. Nothing.
    Only that rumors suggest offering ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to the Witchfire Glen in Grauberg will help in headhunting...whatever this being may be.
    N-n-not thataru I'm dying to find out or anything!${prompt}
  12052: Fanciful-wanciful fairy tales about a frog princess have been passed down in Windurst since days of eld.${prompt}
  12053: |-
    Some say the newcome prince of these froglike beastmen has been seen leaping and bounding about the frontlines of battle.
    No doubt the figment of some delusional soldier's imagination, but still...${prompt}
  12054: |-
    Folklore always spoke of their insatiable-watiable appetites, and now soldiers would tell that feeding them will actually help win them to our cause.
    “Give him ${item-plural: 0[2]},” they say, “and the frog prince will requite!” I can't make heads or tails of it...${prompt}
  12055: N-n-not thataru I bother myself with such childish topics!${prompt}
  12056: |-
    Unprecedented in hitory-wistory, there has recently been an affable plantoid befriending soldiers on the battlefield.
    It most closely resembles one of those mandragora known to inhabitaru the wilds to the west.${prompt}
  12057: |-
    Is that a shred of doubt I sense!? I've seen it with my own eyes, I tell you!
    This is no figment of the imagination or some delusional soldier's hallucination! Still don't believe me?${prompt}
  12058: |-
    Head on over to the Meriphataud Mountains and try trading ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or some fertilizer to the odd little treeman you find.
    He just might be moved to come and help you out in a fightaru!${prompt}
  12059: |-
    Regardless, I wonder what it is he could possibly be doing here...
    N-n-not that I am about to startaru stalking him to find out or anything!${prompt}
  12060: (Shhh! Keep your voice down. “The” Boodlix? The very same who heads his own “trading-wading company”?)${prompt}
  12061: |-
    (Well, they say his trade is death! And deal in it he does, if the rumors are to be believed.
    Some claim to have actually laid eyes on his hidden fortress and lived to tell the tale. They say it's there he greedily occupies himself with counting his blood-money.)${prompt}
  12062: |-
    (What? Have you completely-wetely lost your mind, ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman]!? Why in Goddess's name would you want to headhuntaru him?
    Still, he is supposedly well-connected, even to the Allied Forces, as the wealthy are wont to be.
    But the Beastman Confederate knows his value as well... Hmmm, sounds like trouble-wouble to me.)${prompt}
  12063: |-
    (When the war is over, it is the supply firms that slowly lose their livelihoods.
    I suppose when you look at it from thataru angle, he could possibly be swayed to fight for either side.)${prompt}
  12064: |-
    Some 150 years ago, San d'Oria was ruled by one King Raigegue the Lupine.
    The freelance you ask of now bears the same name as thataru king, though none know how or why.${prompt}
  12065: |-
    He is remembered as a tragic monarch, responsible for leading San d'Oria to utter defeat at the hands of Bastok's preeminent scholar and military tactician-wician, Gunther Schultz, at the Second Battle of Konschtat.
    What followed was an age of chaos and despair, as the Kingdom was ravaged by civil war.${prompt}
  12066: |-
    They say this spectre-wectre of the same name is none other than Raigegue the Lupine himself, led back from the grave by the fire of his wrath.
    He haunts The Eldieme Necropolis. The skeptic in me suspects some exaggeration-wation is at work here...${prompt}
  12067: |-
    Huh!? Headhunting? The undead!?
    I-I... I have no idea how to respond to thataru. You've left me absolutely speechless-weechless.${prompt}
  12068: |-
    Eurytos is the battle-hardened leader of a group of mercenary Gigas from the far north.
    At the onset of the war, the Beastman Confederate took them into their service.
    But recently it would seem Eurytos has completely-wetely removed himself from the confederate's chain of command.${prompt}
  12069: |-
    His might and prowess in battle have led many to speculate that his line is that of the Gigas gods.
    He is truly a force to be reckoned with. For now, his unit has established their compound-wompound somewhere in Vunkerl Inlet.${prompt}
  12070: |-
    Though to be fair, there is precedent for the Gigas fighting under allied banners.
    After all, they did fight for Bastok in the Second Battle of Konschtataru. I wonder... Could the great Eurytos possibly be rallied-wallied to our cause?${prompt}
  12071: This behemoth among behemoths has been roaming Vunkerl Inlet for hundreds upon hundreds of years.${prompt}
  12072: |-
    So many would-be hero-weroes have died in the maws of this great beast that nobody even attempts to keep count any longer.
    Some say its ancientaru age and scar-heavy hide indicate it is not nearly as powerful as it once was. Yet still, you would be a fool to underestimate this fiend, I promise you.${prompt}
  12073: |-
    Headhunting? For the Allied Forces!? I'm not even going to dignify that with a response...
    Although, you have to admitaru, the thought of it alone is quite amusing. Hehehe!${prompt}
  12074: |-
    Who, me? Ohhh, right! I totally forgot.
    You're right, for all intents and purposes, I too am technically-wechnically a freelance.${prompt}
  12075: |-
    I enjoy long walks on the beach aaand... Oh yes, nothing excites me more than conversing with fellow scholars!
    N-n-not thataru I would want to know anything in particular about where Rainemard might be!${prompt}
  12076: |-
    Current taxonomy teaches us that at presentaru, the monoceros family contains few known specimens.
    Those that are classified exhibit great horn spire-wires jutting from their majestic heads, and are either born of light, or of darkness.${prompt}
  12077: |-
    An influx of eyewitness accounts in recent days all point to the undeniable existence of the beastaru named Dark Ixion.
    Tempered like a storm and ever wary, both allies and beastman alike tend to keep their distance.${prompt}
  12078: The other is dubbed Auroral Alicorn and exhibits a brilliantaru shade of white and a calm, gentle demeanor. The two couldn't be more dissimilar-wimilar.${prompt}
  12079: Though almost never seen in the wild prior to the war, Auroral Alicorn has recently been sighted in Jugner Forest, some say nursing wounds.${prompt}
  12080: |-
    Lewenhart is a traveling-waveling bard who has become a favorite amongst the troops, instilling hope and courage with his singing.
    It turns out that almostaru nothing helps morale as a much as a good song.${prompt}
  12081: They say he prefers to stay close to a certain tomb in The Eldieme Necropolis, where his requiems can be heard far and wide.${prompt}
  12082: |-
    He often asks for holy water as payment for his songs, which he puts to cermonial-wonial use.
    And as with most musicians, he loves exchanging in song and banter with fellow bards.${prompt}
  12083: Test.${prompt}
  12084: |-
    A most virtuous priest, who wanders all corners of Vana'diel, filling his belly-welly bread and alms.
    Some swear they've seen a twisted smile on his face as he buries his enemies and offers up prayers in their name.${prompt}
  12085: |-
    He came from the far north, and recently has been spending much of his time in Batallia Downs.
    Whatever is said of him, there can be no questioning his faith in the Goddess, thataru's for sure.${prompt}
  12086: |-
    He was never one to talk much, and certainly not one to mince words when he does. It seems he prefers the company of white mages, though.
    I've heard it said that he has been lending-wending his fists to the Allied Forces as of late.${prompt}
  12087: Test.${prompt}

    Music is your livelihood, too, is it not?
    There are those who wish glory upon themselves. But for us--we sing of legends, rather than become them.${prompt}

    Thank you kindly, friend. I shall offer it with a requiem to the souls of those heroes who have been laid to rest at the Eldieme Necropolis.${prompt}

  12102: Well, you can wash those worries away. I only offer our officers one's opinions, not the omens behind them.${prompt}
  12103: Whether the Warlock Warlord warrants the execution of any one suggestion, now, that is the question--the answer to that question being yes and no.${prompt}
  12104: The moods of our mighty commanders metamorphose with the waxing and waning of the moons. However, I pledge on my honor that I shall make your recommendations known.${prompt}
  12105: Your recommendations have been rightly recorded and shall be relayed to the proper bureaucracies.${prompt}

    Ha-la-li-la-la! A joke, a jest.
    Please, just a moment while I adjust my vest.

    Wildcat General Zhwan.
    Quit.${prompt}
  12113: Oh, Master Caster Lutete of the Ariesan War Warlocks, descendant of Medada, the first ever Manustery Minister. Yes, her eminence exceeds at administering investigations and inquiries to gather intelligence on our infamous enemy's malicious machinations.${prompt}
  12114: Oooh, Master Caster Zonpa-Zippa of the Capricornian War Warlocks... Did you know he also moonlights as Manustery Minister? Amazing are his modern methods of military machina manufacturing. Increased Cardian construction is what he cries at the conferences of our commanders.${prompt}
  12115: Ah, Master Caster Kayeel-Payeel of the Aquarian War Warlocks is known for his subtle strategies that earn his erudites victory after victory on the violent fields of battle.${prompt}
  12116: Presented with the predicament of protecting those peoples with prestigious positions within the Parliament of Patriarchs, the principal's principal problems involve improving the Federation's fundamental fortifications of its filigrees and foundations.${prompt}
  12117: Perih Vashai, major of our mightiest Mithra Mercenary menagerie. Yes, she secures steadfast support from her soldiers by ensuring that the steady stream of supplies seldom strays from suitable levels.${prompt}
  12118: Haja Zhwan, you say? The savage superintendent of our saviors from the south is said to savor the screams of the enemy soldiers as she slices through their ranks. She's been granted a voice within parliament, but her opinings oft fall on deaf organs of aural origin.${prompt}
  12119: ${prompt}
  12120: ${prompt}

  12127: Why, sure! I'm certain our superiors are on the edges of their seats, straining to discern what suggestions you strain to suggest.

    And that suggestion is...?
    ${selection-lines}
    A preemptive strike.
    Diversionary tactics.
    Battleline preservation.
    Stronghold defense.
    Troop conditioning.
    Troop training.
    Reconnaissance.
    Sabotage.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  12129: Quite a dynamic decision... Expanding territory through the execution of an expansive assault. Ex-Warlock Warlord Lungo-Nango would be ecstatic!${prompt}
  12130: Sending forth a small squad of elite agents to sever supply lines... Superb!${prompt}
  12131: Doubling defenses to maintain battlelines... A solid decision...though not that daring.${prompt}
  12132: Supplement stronghold soldiers and sentries to strengthen and stabilize supply routes. Sound thinking, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12133: Whip the whippersnappers into tip-top ship-shape? A simple, yet superb strategy. Stupendous!${prompt}
  12134: Educating an elite force to execute some of our nation's more covert campaigns... Excellent!${prompt}
  12135: Intriguing... It is a fact that intel is integral to the integration of internally formulated battle formulas onto the battlefield.${prompt}
  12136: Ah, dangerous and daring! Special units sneaking into enemy strongholds to cause chaos and provoke pandemonium!${prompt}
  12137: |-
    Is this what you recommend?
    ${selection-lines}
    Absolutely!

    Weapons development.

    I require more time to consider.${prompt}
  12143: Rounding up resources to ready ourselves for an extended engagement with the ever-advancing enemy... Excellent!${prompt}
  12144: Super! It is no surprise that you've selected supplies as the single most significant step to success.${prompt}
  12145: Savvy! Supply route fortification ensures improved defense for our strongholds.${prompt}
  12146: Stabilization of supply flows to our strongholds will help enhance our basic defenses.${prompt}
  12147: Marvelous! Ameliorated management methods of the Federation's guilds will make sure our boys are outfitted with ample equipment.${prompt}
  12148: Brilliant! The best brains in the bludgeoning business brought together to build even better bludgeons for our boys in blue...er, green!${prompt}
  12149: Sound advice, ${name-player}! A nation would always strive to secure the safety of the citizens before seeking anything else!${prompt}

  12151: |-
    Shall I record your opinion?

  12322: |-
    What would you like to know?
    ${selection-lines}
    What is the Allied Campaign?
    What are campaign operations?
    What are ${color: 5}freelances${color: 1}?
    Nothing.${prompt}
  12323: The Allied Campaign is the comprehensive name given to the various operations carried out by the Forces of Altana against the Beastman Confederate.${prompt}
  12324: '“Article 1: Dominion is granted the nation that provides the largest contribution in regaining control of an area occupied by the beastmen.”${prompt}'
  12325: '“Article 2: In exchange for the renouncing of all claims to lands seized by their army, campaign arbitration has been bestowed upon the Grand Duchy of Jeuno.”${prompt}'
  12326: Phew... Did you know it took me two weeks to memorize the charter? Two weeks! Two...weeks!${prompt}
  12327: Anyway, to put it simply, the leaders of Jeuno were first to recognize that it would be difficult for Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria to cast aside all past differences and join hands on the battlefield. And that's why the Duchy felt it necessary to motivate the armies by offering rewards for their performance.${prompt}
  12328: It's how the nations have been dealing with each other for the past few centuries, so why try to change things, right? Right? Windurst can keep on doing what it does best, and gain territory, resources, and labor in the process.${prompt}
  12329: As a member of the dignified Cobra Unit, you'll be required to participate in various sorts of campaign operations to make sure the star of the Federation shines brightaru!${prompt}
  12330: 'Campaign operations, also known as ${color: 5}Campaign Ops${color: 1}, is the term used for the long list of small-scale missions authorized by the Allied War Council in Jeuno. Ever heard of the Allied War Council? Yeah? No?${prompt}'
  12331: Anyway, it doesn't matter. When an operation is successfully completed, the nation is rewarded with extra battle funding, paid for by the Repositorium--an international bank founded by the four nations of Mindartia and Quon, and located in Jeuno.${prompt}
  12332: To put it in lay terms, you're our proverbial cash cow, ${name-player}! Have you ever seen a cow?${prompt}
  12333: Oh, but don't start making plans to buy that summer home in Bibiki just yet. You see, none of those funds go directly to individual mercenaries. You get paid with Allied Notes, which you can use to purchase supplies and equipment...or equipment and supplies, whichever you wish.${prompt}
  12334: Also, the more operations you accomplish, the more operations will become available to you. It's like a never-ending roller coaster...of operations!${prompt}
  12335: Now, unless you have any more questions, talk with Emhi Tchaoryo here and she'll help you sign up!${prompt}
  12336: Ready to hit the battlefield so soon? Feisty, aren't we! Uh... Feisty, aren't you! Well, before you go, let me explain a little about the Allied Campaign map.${prompt}
  12337: 'To view the campaign map, first select ${color: 5}Region Info${color: 1}, and then ${color: 5}Campaign${color: 1}.'
  12338: 'The ${color: 5}sword${color: 1} indicates areas where battles are currently being waged.'
  12339: If you are not signed up for any operations, then hurry to the frontlines and join your fellow legionnaires.
  12340: 'The ${color: 5}heroism gauge${color: 1} indicates locations where the battles have become quite heated. Who knows what may occur in an area with a full gauge?${prompt}'
  12341: That's it! Now get out there and start shredding those beastmen to dust! Shred to dust...? Whatever, you know what to do!${prompt}
  12342: '${color: 5}Freelances${color: 1} are what we call rogue mercenaries who have not pledged allegiance to any nation.${prompt}'
  12343: These groups do not fall under control of the Allied Forces; they play by their own rules, not our rules, which wouldn't be their rules. Heroes for hire, you could say...or not.${prompt}
  12344: But most of them are quite talented on the battlefield. If there were only a way to convince them to fight for the Federation...${prompt}
  12345: Hey! I just had an idea! Why don't you ask them to join us! Who could turn down a face like that? We're counting on you, ${name-player}...or at least your face!${prompt}
  12346: Hold on, you're not one of our mercenaries, are you? If you're thinking about signing up, go talk to Captain Miah Riyuh. She'll help you out.${prompt}
  12347: Hold on, you're not one of our mercenaries, are you? If you're thinking about leaving that nation you work for now and signing up with us, go talk to Mhoti Pyiahrs. She'll help you out.${prompt}

    ...Heavy infantry, five columns of 200... Two 100-knight regiments... Enemy force casualties estimated at 5,000...
    Oh, I apologize, soldier. I've spent the past few nights preparing for a joint operation with San d'Oria's Royal Knights.${prompt}
  12451: You look like you've seen better days, soldier. Let me guess, it's the war that's bringing you down. What you need is a little music in your life!${prompt}
  12452: If it weren't for the Galkan heavy infantry, this nation wouldn't last a month against the turtlebacks. And what thanks do we get? A handful of stale army biscuits!${prompt}
  12453: Have you ever stopped to ponder what that comet might truly portend? I'd like to believe it is a message of hope--that soon this age of darkness will come to a close...${prompt}
  12454: Oh, whatever has become of my sweet Windurst? Rabble running through the streets, streets overrun with rabble! Why are you even speaking to me!? Does the title Master Caster no longer garner even an onz of respect!?${prompt}
  12455: Ah, the Fates have brought you to Gariri the Magnificent! Why am I thus called, you ask? Why, because only I was magnificent enough to decryptify those mysteriously marvelous Near Eastern tomes and open a window to...the Other Side!${prompt}

  12459: Have fun while you can, filthy mercenary, because before long you'll be back on the streets where you belong--replaced by a quiet, obedient army of Cardians!${prompt}
  12460: Normally, it is my duty to protect the patriarchs of parliament, but with the fate of Windurst in doubt, I'm forced to lead my loyal pets to the front lines.${prompt}
  12461: Do you like the headpiece? I made it from my firrrst victim. I wear it to let everrryone know what happens when they cross Mikhe Aryohcha!${prompt}

    In former times, this island was inhabited by a ferocious tribe of vikings.
    It is said they braved vast expanses of open sea to arrive here.
    Romantic, don't you think?${prompt}
  12485: |-
    Surely you have seen the tigers that roam these downs.
    They were brought from the northern continent by the Orcs themselves.

    The village elder in La Vaule told me of the so-called wyrm deity of Grauberg.

    Strange... I am certain the vegetation of this area is different from when I last visited.
    Surely I would not have allowed myself to forget such beautiful flowers.${prompt}

    Such devasation...
    Even the resilient Goobbue were not able to survive.
    I wonder if this place shall ever be restored to its former glory...${prompt}
  12492: History tells us that it was in the year 381 that San d'Oria's iron-tempered  King Lanfeaur R d'Oraguille came these lands to strike a peace with the Quadav. Whatever happened to the bond that was formed...?${prompt}
  12493: |-
    I have seen here two twins who between them share a power for magic the likes of which I have never seen.
    This is indeed a strange nation.${prompt}

    Unfortunate... I had always wished to gaze upon the fabled magic towers of West Sarutabaruta with my own eyes.
    Yet I fear I may be too late...${prompt}

    These windblown sands reak havoc on my throat.

    And so we breach the enemy's inner sanctum. Expect anything, ${name-player}!

    A well conceived strategy...

  12778: Hello, I'm Campaign Evaluation Official Llewellyn. How can I help you today?${prompt}
  12779: |-
    What do you require?
    ${selection-lines}
    Nothing.
    An evaluation.
    Info on the duration of my medal.
    An overview of evaluations.
    Info on medals.
    Info on the benefits of medals.
    Info on evaluation process.${prompt}
  12780: Evaluations are conducted on all participants of the Allied Campaign. Individual data is collected by the Allied War Council from various sources, such as Campaign Arbiters and the leaders of the armies in which the soldiers serve. This data is then used to determine whether or not a decoration is to be conferred.${prompt}
  12781: Some of the areas that are considered in this evaluation are performance in campaign operations, as well as valor shown during campaign battles.${prompt}
  12782: The more an individual is decorated, the more responsibility he or she will be given within the Allied Forces. And with more responsibility comes the promise of larger compensation in exchange for services.${prompt}
  12783: However, the prestige that accompanies the medals also carries with it a great weight. To maintain one's status, he or she must continue to exceed previous expectations. If a soldier fails to fulfill the duties that are required of all those who possess a certain medal, then the Allied War Council will be forced to confiscate that decoration.${prompt}
  12784: To put it simply, only those who fight with fervor and precision...only those who put the glory of the Allied Campaign above all else...will be allowed to reap the benefits that come with victory.${prompt}
  12785: 'If you wish to learn more of the Allied Campaign, please speak with ${choice: 3}[/Lady Fiaudie/Centurion Aurelius/Kolin-Olin].${prompt}'
  12786: There are two more things of note.${prompt}
  12787: 'Once an evaluation has been requested, the Allied War Council will require ${choice: 0}[five days/one hour] (Earth time) to come to a conclusion.${prompt}'
  12788: During that time, individuals may join as many operations or battles as they wish, but will only be considered for a single medal.${prompt}
  12789: However, the same rules apply for an inadequate performance. No matter how low one scores, the maximum number of decorations that can be confiscated is one.${prompt}
  12790: Also, individuals must not forget that all medals come with expiration dates. While an extremely unorthodox practice, this measure was deemed necessary to prevent the forgery of allied decorations by those persons with dubious intentions.${prompt}
  12791: Upon conferral, all medals are marked with a magical seal that dissipates after a period of thirty days (Earth time). Once the seal has vanished, the medal will become void and its owner will no longer be able to participate in campaign operations or battles, among other things.${prompt}
  12792: It is highly recommended that you keep track of the time remaining on your medal and apply for evaluations regularly.${prompt}
  12793: Is there anything else you wish to ask?${prompt}
  12794: Campaign medals are official rewards given to those individuals who perform exemplary deeds for the Allied Forces.${prompt}
  12795: These decorations are internationally recognized as symbols of strength, loyalty, and honor. They not only garner respect, but provide their bearers with privileges not offered civilians.${prompt}
  12796: Those who have been decorated with the more prestigious medals will also be highly regarded among their army's ranks, and thus entrusted with increasingly difficult and important missions.${prompt}
  12797: On the other hand, disloyalty to one's nation is highly frowned upon. If, for any reason, an individual wishes to leave their current army of employment and pledge allegiance to another, they will be required to return their two most distinguished medals.${prompt}
  12798: To the point, are we? Very well, I shall list the merits those in the possession of medals may receive.${prompt}
  12799: 'Firstly, the more prestigious an individual''s medal, the more weight ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] army''s ${choice: 3}[/curate/supply commander/Morale Manager] will grant ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] opinion.${prompt}'
  12800: Secondly, the types of Campaign Ops available to an individual will increase based on the medals that ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] has in ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] possession. More advanced operations will earn participants increased amounts of EXP and Allied Notes, as well as have a heavier influence on performance evaluations.${prompt}
  12801: Thirdly, benefits received during campaign battles will vary depending on the variety of medals an individual carries. The better the medals, the larger the opportunity to earn EXP, Allied Notes, and reputation. The selection of temporary items available for purchase will also improve.${prompt}
  12802: However, the more prestigious the medal, the more that will be expected of its bearer. The Campaign Arbiters will not go easy on those who have already proven themselves.${prompt}
  12803: Understood?${prompt}
  12804: 'Greetings, ${name-player}. My ledger states that the earliest you can apply for an evaluation is in ${number: 0} day${choice-plurality: 0}[/s].${prompt}'
  12805: 'Greetings, ${name-player}. My ledger states that the earliest you can apply for an evaluation is in ${number: 0} hour${choice-plurality: 0}[/s].${prompt}'
  12806: Greetings, ${name-player}. My ledger states that the earliest you can apply for an evaluation is...any moment now.${prompt}
  12807: Is there something I can help you with in the meantime?${prompt}
  12808: Greetings, soldier. Unfortunately, I cannot authorize the evaluations of those individuals who have not pledged their allegiance to this nation's forces.${prompt}
  12809: Understood. I shall prepare the proper documents and deliver them to the Allied War Council Evaluation Board in Jeuno.${prompt}

  12823: Oh, and don't go getting the wrrrong idea. The reason you're wearing that medal isn't because “you” are a fine soldier, it's because you're backed by the best damn unit in the Federation. Dismissed!${prompt}
  12824: 'That is all. Please note that you will not be eligible for another evaluation for ${choice: 7}[five days/one hour] (Earth time). Good luck, ${name-player}.${prompt}'
  12825: Are you certain, ${name-player}? You know there is no need to be humble.${prompt}
  12826: Or perhaps you have forgotten that it doesn't matter how much you contribute to the Allied Campaign, you can only receive one medal per evaluation.${prompt}
  12827: I cannot force you to accept the medal, but...${prompt}
  12828: While the Allied War Council was pleased with your work, it was determined that your performance did not warrant the conferral of further decoration.${prompt}
  12829: 'You still have ${number: 2} day${choice-plurality: 2}[/s] (Earth time) until your current campaign medal expires.${prompt}'
  12830: Your current campaign medal will expire in less than a day (Earth time).${prompt}
  12831: Your current campaign medal has already expired.${prompt}
  12832: Would you like to continue this month's evaluation in a further attempt to receive the next medal, or would you rather end the evaluation and maintain your current honors?${prompt}

  12853: |-

    I regret to inform you, ${name-player}, that your performance this term fell a measure short of the council's expectations.
    Admittedly high expectations, but nevertheless...${prompt}

  13032: And wherrre have you two been, eh!?${prompt}
  13033: Now, look here! How darrre you go off gallivanting like that, leaving poor Mikhe behind!${prompt}
  13034: Hmm...you're looking well for someone who has just recently “collapsed from starvation.”${prompt}
  13035: A speedy recovery made possible because of you, to be surrre.${prompt}
  13036: Lehko. ${name-player} is one of our very best.${prompt}
  13037: It's one thing to be frrriendly with ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]. But if you go planting any strrrange ideas in ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] head, there'll be hell to pay. Understood?${prompt}
  13038: Not that I have a mind to do anything of the sort, but what happened to trrrusting in your fellow Mithra?${prompt}
  13039: I'd love to stay here and be on the receiving end of more good-willed prrreaching, but my presence is required elsewhere. Now, if you'll excuse me...${prompt}
  13040: Hm?${prompt}
  13041: Going to see the Warlock Warlord? I've been summoned, myself.${prompt}
  13042: A delightful coincidence! I must say, it's much more fun being scolded en masse.${prompt}
  13043: I appreciate your attendance on such short notice.${prompt}

  13045: I thought you wouldn't mind an extra guest, especially one who left such a positive impression on you the other day.${prompt}

  13050: The last battle exacted a heavy toll...${prompt}
  13051: Those who survived unwounded have not had the luxury of rest, and are either back on active duty or overseeing the training of new additions to our forces.${prompt}
  13052: Even with Minister Zonpa-Zippa's Cardians included in the equation, our numberrrs are meager at best.${prompt}
  13053: If things are left as they stand, our armies will waste away into nothingness, even without external urging.${prompt}
  13054: But the enemy we face cares not for the waiting game...${prompt}
  13055: Enter!${prompt}
  13056: This is Naho Gwanboh, leader of the Cheetah Volunteers newly arrived from Olzhirya. She and the Cheetahs will be partaking in the upcoming operation with the Cobra Unit.${prompt}
  13057: That's a shiny new rifle you have therrre.${prompt}

  13060: The Gha Nabohan economy is evidently experiencing a bubble perrriod. Windurst's, on the other hand...${prompt}
  13061: Do we have the financial means to recrrruit shipload after shipload of mercenaries? The debt we owe to the High Matriarch must be astrrronomical.${prompt}
  13062: I like frisky, but this kitty here's frrrisky to the point of irritating.${prompt}
  13063: Easy there, boss, she's prrrobably just the designated tour guide during our stay. No need to get worrrked up.${prompt}
  13064: “Tour guide,” huh? You sure have a big mouth for a small frrry.${prompt}
  13065: I'm pleased to see that the Mithran welcoming trrradition hasn't been lost to those outside the motherland. Now, what say you and I get rrreal acquainted?${prompt}
  13066: Ahem! Seeing how we're now introduced, let's commence the brrriefing, shall we?${prompt}
  13067: '...Romaa and Naho, your two units are to head to the Aragoneu front.${prompt}'
  13068: Our agents have reported movement by the sizeable enemy force first sighted at the Meriphataud Mountains.${prompt}
  13069: The beastmen are headed west towards Sauromugue Champaign and, during their advance, have been observed absorbing units previously deployed throughout Aragoneu.${prompt}
  13070: Has the strategic importance of the Garlaige Citadel been exposed?${prompt}
  13071: '...Or is the Shadow Lord finally mobilizing his forces to lay siege to Jeuno?${prompt}'
  13072: Our intelligence favors the probability of the latter--Gigas Catapulters and Armored Division Quadav form the bulk of their assault force.${prompt}
  13073: So they've turrrned their attention to Jeuno...${prompt}
  13074: Those at the Allied Headquarters are aware of the encroaching threat and are deeply perturbed, to say the least. They bid us double our contribution to the defense of Jeuno's eastern wall.${prompt}
  13075: Quite an unsympathetic request to put forth to an impoverished nation with barrrely enough soldiers to man its own gates.${prompt}
  13076: Yeah, the sorry bunch at headquarters lazing in their cushy lounge chairrrs, surrounded by Jeuno's thick walls--they haven't the slightest idea of the situation we're in.${prompt}
  13077: It is the Allied War Council you so despise that provided us with the funding required to recruit the services of the Cheetah Volunteers.${prompt}
  13078: I much preferrr “Cheetah Army” myself. Has a much more menacing rrring to it.${prompt}
  13079: So, my unit's task is to escorrrt the new arrivals to the eastern wall?${prompt}
  13080: Not quite. Lehko, the details, if you will.${prompt}
  13081: Yours will be a diversionary mission for the purpose of allowing the rrreal reinforcements to reach Jeuno unscathed. I, too, will be partaking in this operation.${prompt}
  13082: So we're to be the bait, eh? Well, I can't argue against us being more suited to attrrracting undue attention than a merry band of Tarutaru.${prompt}
  13083: You are to do no more than simply draw their attention--no giving chase, and no magic.${prompt}
  13084: '...Because any amateurish spell-casting would reveal our identity as mere mercenaries to the enemy, rrright?${prompt}'
  13085: |-
    Correct.
    This operation will be conducted with Lehko at the helm. I trust there will be no objections?${prompt}
  13086: '...Fine with me.${prompt}'
  13087: I'll have you know that we Cheetahs didn't come all the way across the ocean to be bossed arrround on the battlefield.${prompt}
  13088: And I'll have you know that I'll not tolerate your blatant disrrregard for professionalism jeopardizing the safety of my unit.${prompt}
  13089: |-
    Now, now, ladies...
    As long as the main strrrategy is abided by, you have free rein over your respective units.${prompt}
  13090: And, I promise to refrrrain from excessively imposing leadership during the operation.${prompt}
  13091: Now you'rrre talking!${prompt}
  13092: The thinly layered eastern wall is one of Jeuno's few structural weaknesses. The beastmen are certain to concentrate their offensive there.${prompt}
  13093: The success of the fortress city's defense against the besiegers relies heavily upon the outcome of your mission. Much is at stake.${prompt}
  13094: Participating units are to regrrroup at Sauromugue Champaign.${prompt}
  13095: One last thing. Please avoid engaging in unnecessary skirmishes with the enemy until the operrration is concluded.${prompt}
  13096: You're rather slight for a soldierrr. Wouldn't those waifish arms of yourrrs feel more at home with a kitchen knife than a sword?${prompt}
  13097: You obviously have doubts about my battle prrrowess. I'd be more than happy to perrrsonally convince you otherwise.${prompt}
  13098: Nyahahaha! Save your strrrength for the upcoming operation. You'll need it...${prompt}

  13103: And with regards to the diversionary operation--${prompt}

  13105: "The matter is in your hands. \nI trust you need not be reminded of the pivotal role they will play in the coming decisive battle.${prompt}"
  13106: |-
    Naturrrally.
    So, any worrrd from the motherland as of late?${prompt}
  13107: |-
    Hmph...
    Only that they can provide no further reinforcements, and advise us to abandon Windurst should control of the situation escape our grasp.${prompt}
  13108: They have offered asylum for Her Holiness at the capital, Yhoh, should necessity dictate.${prompt}
  13109: My, my, what a kind and carrring soul the High Matriarch is.${prompt}
  13110: A shrewd, ambitious wench, that one.${prompt}
  13111: Her scheming goes so far as to even have the Star Sibyl in her grasp.${prompt}
  13112: Our situation grows more precarious still...${prompt}
  13113: Hey, what are you still hanging around here for? The rrrest of the Cobras have already departed for Sauromugue Champaign!${prompt}
  13114: You better do some serrrious catching up, or the boss'll give you what for!${prompt}
  13115: Do you rrremember where you're supposed to be?${prompt}
  13116: Not here, that's for surrre! Get your sorry little backside up to Sauromugue Champaign on the double, soldierrr!${prompt}
  13117: ${name-player}! It's grrreat to have ya back!${prompt}
  13118: Hey, boss! Look who's here!${prompt}
  13119: So our globetrotting prrrodigal ${choice-player-gender}[hero/heroine] has finally decided to show ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] face...${prompt}
  13120: Aw, was that sarrrcastic tone of voice necessary, boss? Welcome back, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  13121: (The boss may seem unfrrriendly right now, but she's actually been in great spirits. Thanks to you, of course!)${prompt}
  13122: Hey, I was just teasing! Even I'm allowed to engage in light-hearrrted joshing from time to time, you know.${prompt}
  13123: Thanks to your contrrribution, our operation to secure safe passage to Jeuno for the Cancerian and Geminian War Warlocks was a success.${prompt}
  13124: Hey, look! The Cheetah Volunteers are here, too!${prompt}
  13125: Naho, the Cheetahs perrrformed most gallantly.${prompt}
  13126: Lehko's mentioned his intent to have our two units continue working cooperrratively. I'm very much looking forward to our next mission togetherrr.${prompt}
  13127: |-
    Don't rrremind me!
    I've had more than a gutful!${prompt}
  13128: Oh, and ${name-player}. This is for you.${prompt}
  13129: It's your hard-earned rewarrrd for your part in the operation, compliments of the Warlock Warlord himself! He's cerrrtainly taken a liking to you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13130: I've got your rewarrrd for participating in the diversionary operation here.${prompt}
  13131: It's from the Warlock Warlord himself. You should feel honorrred!${prompt}
  13132: That was a rather close call.${prompt}
  13133: I offerrr no excuses. My plan failed to take into account the possibility of a large unit of Gigas.${prompt}
  13134: It's very uncharacteristic of you to overlook such things. At this stage, we mustn't allow any more surprises to catch us off guard.${prompt}
  13135: |-
    With that, I can wholehearrrtedly agree.
    And another issue requiring our attention--${prompt}
  13136: |-
    Shantotto, am I right?
    Only with great difficulty will we be able to manipulate such a potent playing piece.${prompt}
  13137: |-
    Leave her be for now.
    Her presence without serves to draw away the enemy's attention and can be considered a boon.${prompt}
  13138: Hmm... You have the rrright of it.${prompt}
  13139: Each step towards the decisive battle must be taken with ever increasing vigilance. Above all, our pawn must be given time to achieve full maturity.${prompt}
  13140: Be it a knight, a rook, or a bishop...${prompt}
  13141: '...Or perhaps, even queen?${prompt}'
  13142: But, no matter what piece, the opponent, too, is in possession of the same...${prompt}
  13143: |-
    ...Number 42, Tihyu Borajah. Cause of death...blood loss from severed artery, from an arrow taken in the thigh.
    Number 43, Kopih Malawayah. Died instantly from massive head trauma inflicted by a blunt instrument. Number 45...${prompt}

    ...Subject unidentifiable.

  13147: See with your eyes, and listen with your earrrs, my fellow Mithra...${prompt}
  13148: Witness for yourself what one loathed “sinner” will accomplish in this tumultuous age...${prompt}
  13149: Oh, therrre you are, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  13150: We were wondering where you'd scamperrred off to!${prompt}
  13151: Didn't you hear? There's a big powwow at Heavens Tower, and that crusty old Warrrlock Warlord has called for all mercenaries to attend!${prompt}
  13152: The boss told us to make sure we didn't forget you!${prompt}
  13153: |-
    What's that? You're not a Cobra, you say?
    Rrrreally? You could have fooled us!${prompt}
  13154: |-
    Serrriously!
    With as much as you've helped us out of late, even the boss thinks you're one of the gang!${prompt}
  13155: |-
    Besides, Lehko and the Warlock Warlord gave strict orders.
    They seem to have taken quite an interrrest in you!${prompt}
  13156: And we're off to Heavens Tower!${prompt}
  13157: It seems all are present, so I'll begin at once.${prompt}
  13158: It hardly needs be said that the situation faced by our Federation army--nay, that of the entire Allied Forces--is dire.${prompt}
  13159: With the defense of Fort Karugo-Narugo and of Windurst itself, not to mention the recent skirmish at Sauromugue, our resources and manpower are being stretched to their very limits.${prompt}
  13160: The call for backup on the Jeunoan front has only depleted our forces further.${prompt}
  13161: |-
    No longer do we have the luxury of sitting around to ponder our next move.
    We must act, and act now.${prompt}
  13162: '...${prompt}'
  13163: Nor is Windurst alone. Our allies, too, face the selfsame plight.${prompt}
  13164: It is in these grim times that the Allied Forces have decided to cast the die. To embark on the one path that may yet lead us to victory...${prompt}
  13165: |-
    We strike at the heart of the enemy.
    We move on Castle Zvahl.${prompt}
  13166: The snowswept peaks of Valdeaunia will be the site of our greatest--our final--battle.${prompt}
  13167: '...${prompt}'
  13168: From today, the Federation forces will divide into two hosts.${prompt}
  13169: The War Warlocks, under my command, will march on the enemy, while the Mithran Mercenaries remain behind to defend the homeland...${prompt}
  13170: |-
    ...With one exception.
    Romaa and the Cobras, I have chosen you to accompany me north.${prompt}
  13171: Understood.${prompt}
  13172: |-
    Looks like we've been tapped for housesitting duty again.
    Borrrrrring!${prompt}
  13173: Awww... And here I thought I'd be able to snag the heads of another beastman general or two for my collection!${prompt}
  13174: Are you truly so naive?${prompt}
  13175: |-
    With our army divided, the city defenses will be stretched thinner still.
    The Yagudo are not likely to overlook this...${prompt}
  13176: |-
    Exactly.
    You must stay vigilant, and be prepared to defend the Federation at the first sign of enemy movement.${prompt}
  13177: |-
    Of course, Warlock Warlord.
    You can rrrely on us.${prompt}
  13178: |-
    The rest of you. We will rendezvous with our allies at San d'Oria for a briefing before we embark on the march northward.
    Ready your belongings and prepare to depart at once.${prompt}
  13179: |-
    Reportarus from San d'Oria make no mention of any enemy movement in the north.
    Is this information to be trusted? Or shall we dispatch-watch our own scouts?${prompt}
  13180: |-
    There is no need.
    If there is action, we can surely count on...her...to let us know.${prompt}
  13181: I see...so thataru was your plan in ordering the Leonian War Warlocks to stay posty-wosted up north.${prompt}
  13182: The next move belongs to the Confederate...but how will they play?${prompt}
  13183: Can we truly succeed without calling upon...“him”?${prompt}
  13184: '...${prompt}'
  13185: |-
    Tihl, Mihl. You paid a rrrecent visit to San d'Oria, did you not?
    I'll be counting on you two to lead the way.${prompt}
  13186: Yessir, boss sir! We've got it covered, rrright, Mihl?${prompt}
  13187: Leave it to me! I know those strrreets like the back of my paw!${prompt}
  13188: Well, looks like we're making the trrrip to San d'Oria together again, eh ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13189: |-
    It almost seems like fate, y'know?
    Like we were destined to become trrraveling companions...${prompt}
  13190: |-
    There you go again with the sappy sentimentality, Tihl.
    You should hear her around the camp, ${name-player}.
    Always bragging about how you're her best frrriend.${prompt}
  13191: Oh yeah? And what's wrong with that, huh!?${prompt}
  13192: Teeheehee!${prompt}
  13193: |-
    Looks like we'rrre off to San d'Oria together again, eh, ${name-player}?
    Who'd'a thunk it? Teeheehee!${prompt}
  13194: I mean, it's not every day that a Mithra like me gets to bond with someone from your part of the world, rrright?${prompt}
  13195: |-
    Traveling to far-off lands, good friends at your side...
    I shouldn't say it, but at times like this I almost feel like this war isn't all bad, y'know?${prompt}
  13196: |-
    Are you mercenaries or little kittens on a picnic?
    Enough with the vapid prrrattle!${prompt}
  13197: |-
    ${name-player}, you heard the Warlock Warlord.
    We'll be waiting for you in San d'Oria!${prompt}
  13198: |-
    ${name-player}? Why are you still putterrring about here?
    Didn't you hear the Warlock Warlord's orders?
    All Cobras are to make for San d'Oria at once!${prompt}
  13199: |-
    ${name-player}! Fort Karugo-Narugo is on high alert, and you're still rrrunning around here with your tail between your legs!?
    All Cobras are to move out at once! That's an order!${prompt}
  13200: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}.
    Just the person I was hoping to see!${prompt}
  13201: |-
    I was just on my way to rrrun a very important errand.
    Why don't you come with me?${prompt}
  13202: In fact, I insist.${prompt}
  13203: |-
    Where to, you ask?
    Why, to pay our rrrespects to none other than the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  13204: |-
    ...Do I make myself clear?
    Inside the Star Sibyl's chamber, you are to be on your absolute besty-west behavior!${prompt}
  13205: Welcome, my children.${prompt}
  13206: |-
    You are the Warlock Warlord's advisor.
    Lehko Habhoka, was it not?
    Your loyal service to Windurst has not gone unnoticed in these chambers.${prompt}
  13207: I am but a humble Mithra, unworrrthy of the honor of basking in your heavenly radiance, Your Holiness.${prompt}
  13208: I fear I am unfamiliar with the ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who stands beside you...${prompt}
  13209: This is ${name-player}, a close friend of mine and a staunch ally of the Federation war effort.${prompt}
  13210: |-
    I see.
    Then the pleasure is mine, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13211: |-
    Forgive us this intrrrusion, Your Holiness.
    I trust you know whom it is we seek...${prompt}
  13212: '...${prompt}'
  13213: |-
    Very well.
    Come with me.${prompt}
  13214: He conducts his research down here...in the darkness.
  13215: |-
    “Place your trust in me, and Windurst shall escape its fate of ruin,” he said.
    And who was I to doubt him?
  13216: |-
    He pursues his experiments like a man possessed...
    Or so he did, until his progress stalled, for lack of a certain...vital resource.${prompt}
  13217: Where will it all lead?${prompt}

    I am...frightened.
    Yes, frightened to the very depths of my soul.
  13220: |-
    I have brought your guests.
    May we enter?${prompt}
  13221: Karaha-Baruha...?${prompt}
  13222: So you are...${prompt}
  13223: |-
    Forgive me.
    I am Lehko Habhoka, advisor to the Warlock Warlord.${prompt}
  13224: |-
    Do not apologize. It seems I evoke a similar reaction in most.
    Yes, I am Karaha-Baruha, Minister of the Optistery.${prompt}
  13225: Though these days, I make my home here among these dusty shelves and musty tomes, as you see.${prompt}
  13226: Yes. I am familiar with your...rrresearch.${prompt}
  13227: |-
    Minister Karaha-Baruha, I fear our situation has turned for the worse.
    The barrier has fallen in the recent attack on Fort Karugo-Narugo.${prompt}
  13228: |-
    Ah, yes...I suspected as much.
    I felt a disturbance in the magical forces to the east.
    A sudden surge, and then...silence.${prompt}
  13229: Minister, you must complete your research...and without delay.${prompt}
  13230: |-
    Oh, it's quite complete, you see.
    Or it would be...were only I not deprived of that which I need most.${prompt}
  13231: |-
    Your Holiness.
    Please bring the item of which the minister speaks.${prompt}
  13232: '...${prompt}'
  13233: |-
    No! I cannot! I must not!
    Please, Karaha-Baruha, let us forget this madness!${prompt}
  13234: Star Sibyl...${prompt}
  13235: |-
    Robel-Akbel made me swear!
    He said that you could not be allowed to continue your work!
    That if you do, something...terrible...will happen to you...${prompt}
  13236: '...${prompt}'
  13237: |-
    We have the mighty War Warlocks and the brave Mithra Mercenaries. Windurst's army is loyal and strong.
    Surely they can defend us from any onslaught...${prompt}
  13238: Please, I beg of you...${prompt}
  13239: |-
    Star Sibyl.
    Surely you cannot be serious.${prompt}
  13240: |-
    Your words are unbecoming of your station.
    You are the leader of a nation. The preservation of Windurst should be your first--your only--priority.${prompt}
  13241: But...${prompt}
  13242: Forgive me.${prompt}
  13243: Well, shall we?${prompt}
  13244: '...${prompt}'
  13245: |-
    Here...
    Do with it as you must.${prompt}
  13246: |-
    Ah yes...the Book of the Gods. The key to my research, so long denied to me.
    You have my thanks.${prompt}
  13247: |-
    Now let us proceed.
    Our time, after all, is short...no?${prompt}
  13248: It is.${prompt}
  13249: |-
    Long have I labored...down here in the depths where the sun dares not shine, where night and day are as one.
    I have but a single goal...to save Windurst from its prophesied destruction.${prompt}
  13250: |-
    I will not bore you with the specifics, which would be beyond your comprehension anyhow.
    Let it suffice to say that the deeper I delved into the ancient secrets, the clearer it became to me.
    They were all speaking in unison...beckoning me down a singular path.${prompt}
  13251: And that path is...?${prompt}
  13252: The savage beast tamed by Rimilala, the founding mother of our nation.${prompt}
  13253: Yes... I speak of Fenrir.${prompt}
  13254: The power that brought the ferocious beast of legend to its knees...is the only power that can save Windurst once more.${prompt}
  13255: '...${prompt}'
  13256: |-
    But how was Rimilala able to subdue the beast?
    Is this rrrecorded in the tome?${prompt}
  13257: |-
    Let us see...
    Ahh, yes...yes...${prompt}
  13258: To ensnare the raging beast, Rimilala summoned all of her prodigious powers and channeled them into the creation of a single artifact.${prompt}
  13259: "The mystic fetters of supreme power...at once supple as the wind and stronger than darksteel... \nShe bestowed unto it the name...${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}"
  13260: '${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt}'
  13261: |-
    She cast the fetters into Full Moon Fountain, its arcane force propelling them high into the heavens!
    For an instant that lasted an eternity, all was bathed in moonlight...and when it faded, the great beast was still.${prompt}
  13262: The beast now conquered, Rimilala used her immense power not to beat it into submission...but to reach out to it with tenderness, and share its pain.${prompt}
  13263: '...So it was that the Great Beast Fenrir, seer of the future, became the sworn guardian of Windurst.${prompt}'
  13264: To protect this land with the blessing of the moon and stars for as long as he drew savage breath...${prompt}
  13265: |-
    To decipher the ancient script with such ease...
    Extrrraordinary. You're every bit the genius they say.${prompt}
  13266: |-
    To wield once more those mystic fetters and summon the Great Beast to our aid...
    Such is my one true calling.${prompt}
  13267: |-
    Yet there remains a rub.
    This is how the text continues...${prompt}
  13268: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, its fated role complete,
    was rent in three, ne'er again to meet.${prompt}
  13269: To friends, for safekeeping, was each tatter bestowed...${prompt}
  13270: To the small, to the winged, and to our eight-chambered abode.${prompt}
  13271: |-
    A riddle?
    Ever the whimsical ones, these gods...${prompt}
  13272: |-
    The three tatters of ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}...
    If only they could be recovered somehow, I am certain that I could reunite them and wield their power as Rimilala once did.${prompt}
  13273: |-
    But I can ill afford to leave my laboratory when there is still so much work to be done...
    And yet our time draws near...${prompt}
  13274: Karaha-Baruha...${prompt}
  13275: |-
    There is no need to vex your prodigious brrrain over such a menial task!
    Carry on with your research, and leave the grunt work to your loyal assistants!${prompt}
  13276: You are saying...that you can bring me what I seek?${prompt}
  13277: |-
    With the incredible world-hopping ${name-player} on your side, you may consider the deed as good as done!
    Isn't that right, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13278: |-
    It would seem you speak in riddles as well, Master Lehko.
    I know not what you imply, and yet... Yes, I am certain of it. You and your friend will not let me down.${prompt}
  13279: |-
    Ever the genius, I see!
    Well, ${name-player}, let's be on our way.
    Time is short, and we mustn't keep the minister waiting!${prompt}
  13280: |-
    Well, the best information comes strrraight from the chocobo's mouth, I say.
    When you're looking for a relic to tame a beast, you ask...${prompt}
  13281: |-
    Yes? What is it this time?
    I have pressing matters to attend to, so make it brief.${prompt}
  13282: |-
    Oh, come now.
    You of all should know that this is a matter of the utmost imporrrt.${prompt}
  13283: |-
    ...Hmph.
    Very well.${prompt}
  13284: 'Karaha-Baruha said that according to the Book of the Gods, ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} was torn into three pieces, which were entrusted in turn to the “small,” the “winged,” and the “eight-chambered abode”...${prompt}'
  13285: |-
    Well, ${name-player}, our Carbuncle friend here has kindly agrrreed to share his knowledge, so ask away!
    It won't do to go gallivanting across time and space without a few good clues at your disposal, after all.${prompt}
  13286: '...${prompt}'
  13287: |-
    What will you ask about?
    ${selection-lines}
    The small.
    The winged.
    The eight-chambered abode.
    Nothing at the moment.${prompt}
  13288: The small...hmmm.${prompt}
  13289: There are many diminutive beings in this world.${prompt}
  13290: But none so ancient, nor bonded so closely with Altana's children, as those who call Grauberg home.${prompt}
  13291: |-
    It is said they even have a prophecy.
    That they have been waiting since the dawn of time for their “promised one.”${prompt}
  13292: |-
    “Under a dark star, in the blackest of nights, ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] will come...
    the light in ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] hand illuminating the darkness.”${prompt}
  13293: |-
    A bringer of light? How curious.
    As I recall, they themselves shine rather brightly as well...${prompt}
  13294: |-
    The wings are surely the wings of a bird.
    And birds can only mean...yes.${prompt}
  13295: To think that in those times, we counted them among our frrriends...${prompt}
  13296: |-
    That is ancient history.
    Today, they will sooner skewer you than accede to your request.
    Unless...${prompt}
  13297: |-
    There is one among them called Kaa Toru the Just.
    It is said he honors his word to friend and foe alike.${prompt}
  13298: |-
    Be warned that he does not suffer fools or imposters lightly.
    It would be wise to bring some...proof...of your integrity.${prompt}
  13299: |-
    A structure of many rooms?
    Wherever could that be?${prompt}
  13300: Few buildings remain now that have stood since the Federation was born...${prompt}
  13301: I've found that at times when you're at a loss, sometimes it's best to check rrright under your nose...${prompt}
  13302: Quite true.${prompt}
  13303: |-
    I can think of one such place, though it is like to be sealed shut these days.
    But that's no prrroblem for you now, is it ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13304: Well, I trrrust that's enough to set you on your way.${prompt}
  13305: We have some matters of our own to research, so we shall stay here in Windurst.${prompt}
  13306: |-
    Speak to Velda-Galda by the path to Windurst Walls when you return.
    He will lead you back to Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  13307: |-
    It hardly needs saying that it is not only Karaha-Baruha and ourselves, but all of Windurst that is counting on you this time.
    Do be careful, and report back as soon as your search bearrrs fruit.${prompt}
  13308: |-
    You're still wandering about, ${name-player}?
    Is there something we can do for you?${prompt}
  13309: |-
    How about it?
    Is that enough to get your search starrrted?${prompt}
  13310: |-
    I hardly need remind you that all of Windurst is counting on you.
    Do take care, and report back to us here as soon as your search bearrrs fruit.${prompt}
  13311: |-
    The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    There is no mistaking it.${prompt}
  13312: We are one step closer, for better or for worse.${prompt}
  13313: |-
    I can't help but wonder.
    What would happen if--Goddess forbid--Karaha-Baruha's attempt to summon the Great Beast went awrrry?${prompt}
  13314: |-
    The damage would be great. Of that there can be no doubt.
    And I speak not merely of the buildings that would be leveled by the raging beast.${prompt}
  13315: Indeed. Though he may have assumed a hermit's life, Karaha-Baruha is a Minister of the Federation, and the greatest genius this nation has ever known.${prompt}
  13316: |-
    Yes. Were such a trusted figure to suffer a crushing defeat, the Windurstian people would feel that their greatest--their last--hope had been snuffed out like a candle.
    For them, the war would be as good as lost...${prompt}
  13317: And yet, no doubt the most horrific fate would fall upon Karaha-Baruha himself...${prompt}
  13318: Snapped up in the great jaws of the great beast he would tame...?${prompt}
  13319: |-
    No...nothing so swift or painless.
    If the immense magical power within him were to turrrn against itself...
    ...I shudder at the thought of what might happen.${prompt}
  13320: |-
    As do we all.
    And I suspect the Star Sibyl's grief would be the deepest, the most unfathomable of all...${prompt}
  13321: 'So this is the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt}'
  13322: |-
    The birdman was true to his epithet after all. A pleasant surprrrise.
    I thought for certain that a bitter battle would be inescapable.${prompt}
  13323: The fate that joins our two peoples is a currrious one indeed...${prompt}
  13324: I wonder if it will always be so?${prompt}
  13325: |-
    That will hinge on the course of the war, no doubt.
    Will our Allied Forces triumph?
    ...Or will the Beastman Confederate rule the day?${prompt}
  13326: Or...${prompt}
  13327: |-
    Indeed.
    Or will the conflict drag on, unresolved, for ages and ages to come...?${prompt}
  13328: In that future, Vana'diel will be engulfed in dark shadows, and the stench of death...${prompt}
  13329: And any chance of coming to peace with our erstwhile friends will be lost forever.${prompt}
  13330: The power of magic will slowly fade from our world, the Great Star Tree will wither...${prompt}
  13331: And Vana'diel will sink into an eternal age of dreamless slumber, never to awaken...${prompt}
  13332: |-
    Ah, the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} that Karaha-Baruha seeks.
    Will his research succeed? I suppose only time will tell.${prompt}
  13333: |-
    Many years past--no, it was not so long ago.
    I knew a man not unlike the Minister.${prompt}
  13334: |-
    He pursued with boundless fervor his life's mission--a true calling for which he was prepared to face even death.
    And yet, in the end, his efforts were in vain...${prompt}
  13335: He lost that which he cherished most, and his eternal struggle continued...${prompt}
  13336: After that, he lived only to fight, that he might one day see the nation of the one dear to him reborn...${prompt}
  13337: |-
    His heart empty save for the stinging thorn of remorse, he harbored but one hope.
    That he might someday return to that time...${prompt}
  13338: |-
    That he might do something different...
    That he might save the one he lost...${prompt}
  13339: |-
    ...What's that?
    The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} was being held by a ghostly apparition?${prompt}
  13340: No, I'm afraid I haven't the slightest idea...${prompt}
  13341: |-
    Master Lehko is engagey-waged with other pressing matters at the momentaru.
    You'll have to come back later.${prompt}
  13342: Oh, ${name-player}. Good to see you backy-wack.${prompt}
  13343: |-
    Master Lehko awaitarus you in Heavens Tower.
    Please, come with me.${prompt}
  13344: |-
    Ah, you've returned.
    Excellent!${prompt}
  13345: |-
    We've no time to spare.
    Karaha-Baruha is right this way.${prompt}
  13346: |-
    You have done well, my friends.
    So these are the remains of ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt}
  13347: |-
    There is still much that is unknown to me...
    Can I truly restore it once more?${prompt}
  13348: |-
    No... I cannot afford to doubt myself.
    I can do it... I must.${prompt}
  13349: Shall we begin?${prompt}
  13350: |-
    Well. If it isn't my old friend, Robel-Akbel--no, the Warlock Warlord, I should say.
    It's been a while...${prompt}
  13351: Karaha-Baruha...${prompt}
  13352: 'We''ve just delivered to the minister the ingrrredients he needs to reclaim ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  13353: |-
    I see.
    Good work, Lehko, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13354: "Minister Karaha-Baruha. \nThe fate of our nation hangs in the balance.${prompt}"
  13355: I need not tell you how important it is that you succeed in your efforts.${prompt}
  13356: Yes, of course.${prompt}
  13357: |-
    Thank you, ${name-player}.
    You have served Windurst well.${prompt}
  13358: |-
    Warlock Warlord.
    A moment, if you please.${prompt}
  13359: Before you take your leave, perhaps you will allow me to clear up a few lingering...concerns.${prompt}
  13360: |-
    Oh, it's nothing to do with my research.
    No, these are mere personal...curiosities.
    You need not feel compelled to answer.${prompt}
  13361: |-
    For the longest time, the Star Sibyl refused me access to the Book of the Gods.
    Odd, is it not? Why give me her blessing to begin my work, only to forbid me to complete it?${prompt}
  13362: But the other day, she said something...curious.${prompt}
  13363: She said that it was you who convinced her so.${prompt}
  13364: '...${prompt}'
  13365: You spoke of things so horrific, so frightful, she said, that she was convinced that the tome must be kept far, far from my sight.${prompt}
  13366: I--${prompt}
  13367: |-
    And so I ask, Warlock Warlord.
    Why interfere with my research?
    What are you plotting?${prompt}
  13368: '...${prompt}'
  13369: Who...are you?${prompt}
  13370: '......${prompt}'
  13371: The Robel-Akbel I knew was a gentle, free-spirited soul...as different from you as night is from day.${prompt}
  13372: |-
    Nor is that all.
    The information is classified, released only to us in the Ministries and to the army's highest command, but as word has it...${prompt}
  13373: '...He fell in battle not long after the war began.'
  13374: I too, Karaha-Baruha...${prompt}
  13375: I too once burned with the same passion, the same sense of purpose that I see in you today.${prompt}
  13376: |-
    But that man is no more.
    It is only deep remorse and self-reproach that drives me now.${prompt}
  13377: |-
    Karaha-Baruha.
    I, too, have a mission of my own.
    There is a life I must save...no matter what the cost.${prompt}
  13378: '...?${prompt}'
  13379: And I plan to save you too...from yourself.${prompt}
  13380: You speak as if I intend to die.${prompt}
  13381: You would tell me otherwise?${prompt}
  13382: |-
    ...
    But how...how could you know?${prompt}
  13383: I am the Warlock Warlord Robel-Akbel, and none other.${prompt}
  13384: |-
    I am he--in name, in heart, and in mind.
    Anything else I might once have been...I have long since cast away.${prompt}
  13385: '...${prompt}'
  13386: |-
    When justice is served, you will have the answers you seek.
    If you choose to face them...${prompt}
  13387: |-
    Karaha-Baruha.
    Lend your strength to this nation.${prompt}
  13388: And together, we shall save Windurst from its fate of ruin...${prompt}
  13389: |-
    Thank you, ${name-player}.
    Once again, you have gone above and beyond the call of duty.${prompt}
  13390: |-
    It will not be long now before our final battle is upon us.
    The very survival of our nation is at stake.${prompt}
  13391: |-
    How will it all end?
    I would be a liarrr if I said I had the answers.${prompt}
  13392: |-
    But whatever lies ahead, this much I know.
    I want you at our side to the verrry end.${prompt}
  13393: As a fellow comrade of Windurst, I want you to have this.${prompt}
  13394: May it see you through the coming storm unscathed...${prompt}
  13395: Until next time, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13396: |-
    Which scene will you view?
    ${selection-lines}
    Random scene.
    Recovered the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    Recovered the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.
    Recovered the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}
  13397: You, there. Have you happened to come into possession of any sealed containers in your crossings with the beastmen?${prompt}
  13398: |-
    Some of our bravest soldiers have recently been bringing back a number of such containers following successful invasions of beastman strongholds. Our hope was that within they would contain some sensitive intel we could exploit.
    Only, upon returning, all those who came in contact with these containers began to die off inexplicably, one after the other.${prompt}
  13399: |-
    At present, the Allied Forces are treating these as cases of assassination by the Beastman Confederate elite.
    It would seem they are willing to go to any length to prevent the contents of these containers from being made known.${prompt}
  13400: Should you happen to get your hands on any such container, it is imperative that you bring it back here with all haste and turn it in to an agent.${prompt}
  13401: |-
    Just as we suspected. This contains a great deal of information that will prove vital to our cause.
    Hm, what's this? Not sure what to make of this... Doesn't seem to be terribly important.
    Here, why don't you hang onto it? See if you can't get some use out of it down the road.${prompt}
  13402: |-
    Just as we suspected. This contains a great deal of information that will prove vital to our cause.
    I'll keep it here under strict supervision while we investigate its contents. Job well done, soldier.${prompt}

  13407: It is good to see you in such high spirits. Now, as you are no doubt already aware, the purpose for my journey here is--${prompt}
  13408: Why, the last time we metaru would have been...${prompt}
  13409: At the final-winals of the Three-nation Conflict Tournament! Yes, that's it! Ah, the memories do come flooding back...${prompt}
  13410: I must say, the crowning moment of the tournamentaru was when, in the dying seconds of the final round, I dropped my lord cold to the groundy-wound with the butt of the club and dashed to victory with Petra in hand!${prompt}
  13411: |-
    Why, it's still freshy-wesh in my mind as though it all happened justaru yesterday!
    <Sigh>... Those were the days...${prompt}
  13412: A-ahem! Pray forgive my cutting short of your delightful reminiscences, but the matter I seek to discuss with the Warlock Warlord is of utmost urgency.${prompt}
  13413: Uh, oh yes, that's rightaru! Come with me, please.${prompt}
  13414: Windurst extends its welcome to our San d'Orian allies.${prompt}
  13415: Official emissary from San d'Oria, Halver M Borel, at your service.${prompt}

  13425: Now then, what is this urgent matter that you wish to discuss?${prompt}
  13426: Yes, well...${prompt}
  13427: '...Surrender?${prompt}'
  13428: Those were the exact words of Sir Nag'molada.${prompt}
  13429: That the regions surrounding Jeuno have hosted a great many battles against the beastmen is well known to us.${prompt}
  13430: As a matter of fact, several War Warlock brigades have been deployed to those conflict-ridden areas at the Duchy's behest.${prompt}
  13431: But if Jeuno's intention trrruly is to surrender, it would be in the best interest of Windurst to recall them back to the capital without delay.${prompt}
  13432: |-
    If I may be permitted to speak, my lord.
    San d'Oria is united in the belief that Jeuno must not fall to the beastmen. By order of King Destin, preparations are being made as we speak to send a contingent of knights to bolster Jeuno's defense.${prompt}
  13433: What is the Kingdom's stance on this matter?${prompt}
  13434: My lord, San d'Oria is united in the belief that Jeuno must not fall to the beastmen. By order of King Destin, preparations are being made as we speak to send a contingent of knights to bolster Jeuno's defense.${prompt}
  13435: That is why we've come--to seek help from our Windurstian allies in the form of further reinforcements for the Duchy.${prompt}
  13436: '...${prompt}'
  13437: Something is amiss.${prompt}
  13438: Extrrremely amiss.${prompt}
  13439: Nag'molada is renowned the two continents over as a shrewd negotiator and brrrilliant strategist.${prompt}
  13440: He certainly isn't the type to be preaching surrender at this prrremature stage.${prompt}
  13441: Hm, which means...${prompt}
  13442: While we're sorely aware that the Federation must prioritize its own welfare, Jeuno's surrender would have an irreversibly disastrous effect on the war. Please, sirs, I beg you! Assist us in the defense of Jeuno!${prompt}
  13443: Lehko, what is the current state of our forces?${prompt}
  13444: Hmmm, the War Warlocks cannot be relieved from their current posts. The Mithra Mercenaries, on the other hand, have recently had their numbers replenished. Or perhaps...${prompt}
  13445: Understood.${prompt}
  13446: Windurst would not turn a deaf ear to this earnest request from our San d'Orian brothers and sisters.${prompt}
  13447: Nor would we forget the debt we owe the Kingdom for coming to our aid at Fort Karugo-Narugo.${prompt}
  13448: Your wish is granted. Jeuno can count on reinforcements from Windurst.${prompt}
  13449: Th-thank you, Your Excellency!${prompt}
  13450: Let us fight side by side. For the survival of Jeuno, and the future of all children of Altana.${prompt}
  13451: A moment.${prompt}
  13452: '...?${prompt}'
  13453: If I may inquire your name once more?${prompt}
  13454: But of course! I'm Lilisette, Troupe Mayakov's brightest young star! Honored to have made your acquaintance!${prompt}
  13455: Lilisette...${prompt}
  13456: A beautiful name.${prompt}
  13457: What do you want? Sorry, but now isn't a good timey-wime. There are numerous affairs of state that require my undivided expertaru attention.${prompt}
  13458: You must be tired aftaru your long journey. Was Bastok's reply as favorable as the one you received from us? I do hope the reinforcements makey-wake it to Jeuno in time...${prompt}
  13459: I am one of the Patriarch Protectors, sworn defenders of the Federation's supreme governing body.${prompt}
  13460: Be it from within the shadows or on the frontline of a raging battle, my order's duty is to ensure that no harmy-warm comes to the Patriarchs.${prompt}
  13461: On the hunt, you say? For a red-headed Hume girl with ears so pointy they'd put an Elvaan to shame?${prompt}
  13462: |-
    If you would just listen for a moment, ${name-player} and I are bosom friends!
    More importantly, though, how could you possibly not know of Future Fabulous, the unbeatable tag-team duo!?${prompt}
  13463: |-
    Is that supposed to impress me? I don't give a rarab tail if you're part of some scrag-team duo.
    Unless you have ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, this conversation's over! Hssssss!${prompt}
  13464: H-hey! Who're you calling a scrag!?${prompt}
  13465: <Sigh>... What sin did I commit in a past life to be on the receivin' end of this insolence?${prompt}
  13466: '...${prompt}'
  13467: Alright, alright. You win. I'll give you a chance to prove yourself.${prompt}
  13468: Truly!?${prompt}
  13469: |-
    Sure, why the hell not?
    There's a tedious task that needs doin', and I figure better you than me...${prompt}
  13470: Hm?${prompt}
  13471: |-
    I-I mean, consider yourself fortunate that you found me in a kindly mood!
    Now perk up them ears, 'cause I'm only gonna say this once...${prompt}
  13472: '...Eh? Where was I, now?${prompt}'
  13473: Oh, right. I was gonna say, we got a veritable plague of Mithran cubs here, but I ain't seen no pointy-eared Hume.${prompt}
  13474: What's that? You're on the prowl for a red-headed Hume girl with ears yea long?${prompt}
  13475: Nope, never seen her like. We got Mithran cubs aplenty, though, if they're all the same to you.${prompt}
  13476: To think that the productaru to which I lend my preeminent name was misused and abused! Ah, the outrage!${prompt}
  13477: Rigorous-wigorous testing has proven Zonpa-Zippa's All-Purpose Putty foolproof. Thusly, only in the hands of one who has surpassed fooldom could it conceivably fail to work as intended.${prompt}
  13478: |-
    Yet more fool I for entrusting a task of such importaru to the Mithran Mercenaries.
    Needless to say, I shan't part with good coin for botchy-wotched repairs. I trust there'll be no complaintarus.${prompt}
  13479: And for this reason...${prompt}
  13480: You can get lost and find yourself another unit to join, one that's willin' to take on losers!${prompt}
  13481: Wh-what? No...${prompt}
  13482: For crrryin' out loud, Miah, what's the commotion this time?${prompt}
  13483: Ah, Boss! Sorry for raisin' a ruckus, but I felt duly obliged to put this dud applicant in her place, and then some.${prompt}
  13484: |-
    What'cha still doin' here? Waitin' for an honor guard to send you off?
    Scram, I said! Hssssss!${prompt}
  13485: Hm? Hold on a second. Don't I know you from somewhere, young lady? Jeuno, perrrhaps?${prompt}
  13486: '...!${prompt}'
  13487: It's very kind of my lady to remember. If it please you, ${name-player} and I were the tag-team duo that mashed the Orcs as if they were overripe pamamas!${prompt}
  13488: I had, um...heard that ${name-player} was a member of your ferocious Cobras, and came to see if I could be of any help to ${choice-player-gender}[him/her].${prompt}
  13489: '...${prompt}'
  13490: You're grrravely mistaken if you think this is some jolly summer camp we're runnin' here, young lady.${prompt}
  13491: Oh, I-I hadn't meant to suggest that--${prompt}
  13492: |-
    ${name-player} has survived numerrrous battles and stared death in the face on equal occasions.
    As both ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] commander and comrrrade, I know for a fact that ${name-player}'s no ordinary soldier.${prompt}
  13493: Although ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] time with us is yet brrrief, that ${name-player}'s no ordinary soldier is plain to see.${prompt}
  13494: |-
    That's why I can say this to you, and with confidence: You got nothin' to fearrr.
    ${name-player}'s nobody's easy prey, so don't you worry your prrretty little head off.${prompt}
  13495: As ${name-player} gives you ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] unconditional trrrust, so too must you give ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] yours--that ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] can hold ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] own.${prompt}
  13496: '...!${prompt}'
  13497: B-Boss! These tears...wellin' up unbidden... <Sniffle>...${prompt}
  13498: I take it we underrrstand each other now.${prompt}
  13499: Now then, we each have tasks we're supposed to be seein' to. Not the least of all, you, young lady.${prompt}
  13500: Yes, sir! Thank you ever so much, Major Romaa!${prompt}
  13501: A half-Elvaan, half-Hume child called Lilisette? With fiery red hair, to boot...${prompt}
  13502: Sorry, but I can't say I know her. Wouldn't that frrriend of yours in San d'Oria know more about such a lass?${prompt}
  13503: Lilisette, ${name-player}, I thank you both for your cooperation.${prompt}
  13504: With your invaluable assistance, our mission to entreat the aid of the two nations was a success.${prompt}
  13505: All that remains now is to relay word to Jeuno and ensure that no acts of folly such as surrender take place.${prompt}
  13506: Yes, my lord!${prompt}
  13507: I fear this is where we must part. My duties require that I be at my king's side.${prompt}
  13508: Take this letter and see it safely to the hands of Archduke Kam'lanaut.${prompt}
  13509: After you have done so, be on standby to receive our knights upon their arrival.${prompt}
  13510: Understood, sir!${prompt}
  13511: May the Goddess keep you...${prompt}
  13512: |-
    Can't you see that I'm occupied with my duties?
    I'm far too busy defending this realm from the forces of darkness to engage in idle chit-chat with ungrateful civilians like you.
    Now, begone!${prompt}
  13513: |-
    Greetings!
    Your tireless efforts on behalf of the Allied Forces are well known in these parts!${prompt}
  13514: |-
    What a coincidence that you stopped by.
    As a matter of fact, I have an offer that might prove interesting for you.${prompt}
  13515: I'm not allowed to reveal my sources, but let it suffice to say that a substantial treasure hoard has been unearthed!${prompt}
  13516: The area in which this treasure was found was one recently annexed to our territory thanks in no small part to your valiant efforts, so I simply had to let you in on the news.${prompt}
  13517: |-
    There is one small catch, however.
    Word has it that a frightening monster has staked out the surrounding environs as its lair, and laid claim to the riches within.${prompt}
  13518: |-
    Ordinarily a reclusive beast, it has been sighted only on the rarest of occasions.
    In an odd coincidence, each of the search parties that encountered it happened to be carrying a ${keyitem-singular: 8[2]} at the time...${prompt}
  13519: |-
    Curious, is it not?
    Yet, as the rumor has spread, many brave souls are trying to get their hands on these ${keyitem-plural: 8[2]}, in the hope that they might draw out and slay the beast, and dispossess it of its treasure.${prompt}
  13520: |-
    Where can you get your hands on one, you ask? Ohoho...
    What would you say if I told you that I just happen to have one with me right here?${prompt}
  13521: |-
    I procured it from my...sources, just for you!
    After all, you have as much claim to the riches as any of those would-be treasure hunters.${prompt}
  13522: |-
    Mind you, these aren't easy to come by.
    If we didn't swear allegiance to the same nation, I'd have to charge a fee of ${number: 1} Allied Notes, but...${prompt}
  13523: |-
    Seeing as you're such a staunch ally to our cause, I'd be willing to let it go for only ${number: 0}.
    Do we have a deal?${prompt}
  13524: |-
    Deal? (You currently possess ${number: 2} A.N.)
    ${selection-lines}
    Deal.
    No thanks.${prompt}
  13525: |-
    Really proceed with the transaction?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    On second thought...${prompt}
  13526: "That's a shame. \nWell, if you change your mind, I suggest you come back quickly.\nNow that our forces occupy the area, there's no telling when the beast might move on to greener pastures...${prompt}"
  13527: |-
    Wonderful! You won't regret it.
    With this, the treasure is as good as yours!${prompt}
  13528: I'm afraid you haven't enough Allied Notes...${prompt}
  13529: |-
    I'd appreciate if you could share this news with your comrades as well.
    A chance like this doesn't come every day, you know, and word has it there's more than enough treasure to go around.${prompt}
  13530: |-
    The monster lurks within the region recently brought under ${choice: 0}[San d'Orian/Bastokan/Windurstian] control.
    Make haste, and may the Goddess protect you!${prompt}
  13531: "Oh, it's you again! \nLet me guess. You've come back for the ${keyitem-singular: 8[2]}.\nAm I right or am I right?${prompt}"
  13532: |-
    How about it?
    ${selection-lines}
    Right you are.
    Actually, no...${prompt}
  13533: |-
    Yes? I'm afraid I have no time at the moment.
    Come back later, and we'll talk.${prompt}
  13534: Oh, ${name-player}, there you are!${prompt}
  13535: |-
    ...And not a moment too soon.
    Master Lehko has been searrrching all over for you!${prompt}
  13536: |-
    None too easy a task, I might add, what with everyone in the city rrrunning around like cockatrices with their heads cut off.
    It's utter chaos, I tell you!${prompt}
  13537: What, haven't you heard? Just look!${prompt}
  13538: Hear ye, hear ye! Citizens of Windurst!${prompt}
  13539: Due to imminent danger of a beastman attack, the Federation has declared a state of high alertaru!${prompt}
  13540: |-
    All non-military personnel are hereby ordered to take sheltaru indoors until further-wurther notice.
    I repeataru, this is not a drill!${prompt}
  13541: |-
    Therrre you have it.
    Civilians have been ordered off the streets, and all mercenaries are to ready for battle immediately.${prompt}
  13542: |-
    With the enemy ready to strrrike at any moment, one can never be too ready.
    Have you seen to your preparations?${prompt}
  13543: |-
    Need you even ask!?
    Why, Ajido-Marujido, Child Genius, is ever ready for anything those filthy-wilthy-feathered goons could throw at us!${prompt}
  13544: |-
    What the--!? Are you out of your gourrrd, you little brat!?
    Get back inside! If the city comes under attack, you'll break more than just the rims of those rrridiculous glasses!${prompt}
  13545: |-
    Hah! Like I'd entrust the defense of the Federation to a mangy-wangy lot like you!
    Behold the valiantaru sorcerers and swordswomen of the Windurstian Teen Force (WTF), under the capable command of Warlock-Warlord-in-Waiting Ajido-Marujido!${prompt}
  13546: |-
    Now if you'll excuse us, we have an important audience with the big cheese himself--er, even if he doesn't know it yetaru.
    Someone has to save our glorious nation while you strays stand around swatting insects with your tails!${prompt}
  13547: |-
    DaNGer!★dANgeR!

  13549: |-
    Wh-what!?
    Unhandy-wand me, you confounded contraption!${prompt}
  13550: |-
    This is that stut-doodly-uttering old Koru-Moru's doing!
    Blastaru it! When the Federation falls, he'll rue the day he detained its would-be hero!${prompt}
  13551: I said put me down, you ham-handed heap of--uwaaaaaaaaahhh!${prompt}
  13552: |-
    Oh dearrr.
    Well, that should teach the boy a lesson about getting too big for his brrreeches.${prompt}
  13553: |-
    At any rate, ${name-player}, you'd best hurrry along.
    Master Lehko's waiting in Heavens Tower, and I hear he has an especially imporrrtant assignment for you this time.${prompt}
  13554: |-
    ${name-player}! You'rrre still standing around here?
    Master Lehko's waiting for you in Heavens Tower with a special assignment. Now hurry along!${prompt}
  13555: |-
    Well, if it isn't our stalwart ${name-player}!
    You're always a sightaru for sore eyes.${prompt}
  13556: |-
    With the beastmen drawing ever nearer, it's absolutaru madness around here.
    But please, don't let me keepy-weep you. Master Lehko awaits within.${prompt}
  13557: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}! Always a pleasure.
    Come in, currrl up and make yourself comforrrtable.${prompt}
  13558: |-
    A bit lonely in here today, you say?
    Indeed it is.${prompt}
  13559: With the Warlock Warlord perrrsonally leading the Valdeaunian expedition, I fearrr I've only my own poor company to offer you today.${prompt}
  13560: |-
    But forgive me if I cut short the pleasantrrries.
    ${name-player}, I require your aid in a most vital operrration.${prompt}
  13561: |-
    To wit, I'm expecting a pair of parrrticularly important guests, and they're in need of an escort.
    ...And, should the circumstances demand it, a bodyguard.${prompt}
  13562: |-
    Two Mithran wayfarers from the homeland, to be prrrecise.
    I've just received word that they've arrived safely on Mindartian shores.${prompt}
  13563: |-
    They should be arriving at the rrrendezvous point--the monument that stands on Fort Karugo-Narugo's western embankment--before long.
    Can I trrrust you to see them safely back here?${prompt}
  13564: I'd go myself, but as you might imagine, I have my hands quite full rrreadying the mercenaries and devising a sound strrrategy for the city's defense.${prompt}
  13565: |-
    Motherland Mithra tend to be distrrrustful sorts, as likely to rend the throat of an interloper as give them the time of day.
    But don't worry. A mention of my name should be enough to keep their claws sheathed.${prompt}
  13566: '...At least I prrray as much, for your sake. Ha-ha!${prompt}'
  13567: Hmm? What makes you the lucky ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] for the job, you ask?${prompt}
  13568: |-
    Why, you've seen how jealous my girls get every time I grace a member of the fairer sex with a glance.
    If they discovered that I'd perrrsonally invited two lovely ladies to my humble abode, why, the ensuing battle would send shivers up the spine of the Shadow Lord himself!${prompt}
  13569: |-
    Oh, and you needn't worry, ${name-player}.
    My “friends” are merrrely business acquaintances, nothing more.
    <Wink, wink>${prompt}
  13570: |-
    Certainly, a dashing fellow such as yourself can sympathize with my prrredicament.
    <Wink, wink>${prompt}
  13571: |-
    Anyway, there you have it.
    Let me remind you again that this mission calls for the utmost secrrrecy.${prompt}
  13572: |-
    Take care to be neither witnessed nor heard by a soul.
    Least of all the Shadow Lord's minions...or any of your fellow mercenaries of the female perrrsuasion.${prompt}
  13573: In fact, I've got just the way for the three of you to keep an especially low prrrofile on your return.${prompt}
  13574: |-
    You rrrecall the subterranean passage connecting Fort Karugo-Narugo with the capital, do you not?
    The caverns where you helped us stave off the Yagudo onslaught...${prompt}
  13575: |-
    The entrance lies along the wall of the central grrrounds, due east of the rendezvous point.
    Why don't you lead our guests back through there?${prompt}
  13576: |-
    And now, ${name-player}, if you'll forgive me, prrressing matters elsewhere demand my attention.
    I'll keep the hearth warm for your return. May the Goddess watch over you!${prompt}
  13577: |-
    So this is the Windurst of which I have heard so much.
    Such a lush and resplendent nation...'tis a shame to see it so rrravaged by war.${prompt}
  13578: |-
    <Sniff, sniff>
    The air smells pretty, like frrresh flowers and leaves.
    I like it here, Meowmmy!${prompt}
  13579: |-
    As do I, Syu. But we've no time to stop and smell the rrroses.
    Lead us to Lehko, friend.${prompt}
  13580: |-
    It's my pleasure to welcome you to Windurst, Nhev Befrathi.
    Or should I say, Chieftainness...?${prompt}
  13581: |-
    Call me what you will. A woman in my position has little use for forrrmalities.
    This is my daughter, Syu.${prompt}
  13582: |-
    You've done well to lead my frrriends safely here, ${name-player}.
    Once again, you prove yourself worthy of all the trrrust I place in you, and then some.${prompt}
  13583: |-
    And with that, Nhev, let us prrroceed with our trrransaction.
    The item we spoke of--${prompt}
  13584: '...Is here.${prompt}'
  13585: The Bow of Light...${prompt}
  13586: '...Never did I imagine I would gaze upon it again with these two eyes.${prompt}'
  13587: Lehko...?${prompt}
  13588: |-
    There is no need for concerrrn, Nhev.
    ${name-player} is a friend--a staunch ally who has demonstrated ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] loyalty time and again.${prompt}
  13589: Perrrhaps you have heard the tales, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13590: |-
    It was some ten years ago.
    A Mithran wayfarer returned to the motherland after a brief sojourn on these shores.
    She took with her a souvenir acquirrred in her travels: a most currrious stone...${prompt}
  13591: |-
    A stone which for ages had lain sleeping in the frrrozen north.
    A stone possessed of immense and terrrible power...${prompt}
  13592: |-
    The trrraveler's name was Yow Rabntah, and with that stone, she fashioned a bow.
    An ensorcelled weapon of the most exquisite crrraftsmanship--so beautiful, and so deadly...${prompt}
  13593: '...The Bow of Light.${prompt}'
  13594: It is well possible that Yow Rabntah had only the purrrest of intentions--that the bow was meant to prrrotect her beloved homeland, and nothing more.${prompt}
  13595: |-
    Sadly, that is not what came to pass.
    For with its grrreat power came even grrreater temptation.${prompt}
  13596: '...Temptation that proved too strong for her--or me--to rrresist.${prompt}'
  13597: '...${prompt}'
  13598: |-
    The power that seethes within the Bow of Light is no ordinary power.
    It is a force that reaches to the very depths of our souls to wrest forth the fear, the ugliness, that we would deny is there.${prompt}
  13599: |-
    Jealousy, deceit, hatrrred...
    The evils that lie dormant within all of us are rrroused and brought to the fore, and we are powerless to resist.${prompt}
  13600: Powerless indeed...${prompt}
  13601: |-
    Before we could realize where we went astrrray, our verdant home was bathed in the crrrimson of our own blood.
    Time-nurtured bonds between sister and sister rrripped to shreds like so many scraps of cloth...${prompt}
  13602: |-
    Yow Rabntah was deemed a sinner for having brought this calamity upon us, and tried for her crimes.
    As fate would have it, she met her end at the hand of a fiend before her judgment could be passed.${prompt}
  13603: '...${prompt}'
  13604: |-
    As Chieftainness, I shared responsibility for the slaughter, and for this sin they hunt me to this very day.
    Even my daughter--guilty of naught but sharrring my blood--is forced to live the life of a fugitive.${prompt}
  13605: |-
    A tale to tug at the heartstrrrings, is it not, ${name-player}?
    I thought that by bringing Nhev and Syu to our shores, they could finally live out their lives in peace.${prompt}
  13606: |-
    Sadly, the predator is not so easily thrown off the scent.
    You're acquainted with the Mithran Tracker Shikaree G, are you not?
    Dispatched from the homeland, she continues to hunt her prrrey with an implacable tenacity that borders on obsession.${prompt}
  13607: |-
    ${name-player}, was it?
    I share with you my tale because Lehko assures me that you are a friend.
    Pray do not betrrray our trust.${prompt}
  13608: This, I shall take into my care.${prompt}
  13609: It's my duty as much as yours to see this dark chapter of our people's historrry to a fitting end.${prompt}
  13610: But Lehko--${prompt}
  13611: |-
    Have no fear, Nhev.
    Realizing the error of her ways, Yow Rabntah with her dying breath wove a potent incantation to seal the terrible power deep within her creation.${prompt}
  13612: That such meaningless bloodshed would never again be visited on her prrrecious people...${prompt}
  13613: |-
    The secret to undoing the seal, she carried to her grrrave.
    The bow rrremains, but there is not a living soul who can release its power.
    Is this not so?${prompt}
  13614: Aye, you've the rrright of it.${prompt}
  13615: |-
    Very well. I was prepared to dispose of it by my own hand, but the task is yours if you would have it.
    Syu and I have a long road ahead of us still, and 'tis perhaps best we keep the burrrden light.${prompt}
  13616: |-
    Indeed. Best the two of you find somewherrre to lie low until the fighting is through.
    The battlefield that awaits us will be no place for a child...${prompt}
  13617: |-
    I've ordered all families in the city to take up shelter in Windurst Walls.
    You're more than welcome to a spot among them.${prompt}
  13618: |-
    No. Your offer is kind, but we must press on.
    With the Tracker on the prowl, this place is not safe for us.${prompt}
  13619: We make for a city called Jeuno.${prompt}
  13620: |-
    A sound choice. The Duchy is vast, with a citizenry as diverrrse as it is numerous.
    If there is any place you might succeed in disguising your tracks, it would be there.${prompt}
  13621: ${name-player}, if I could trrrouble you to escort our guests to--${prompt}
  13622: |-
    That won't be necessary.
    We've imposed on your friend quite enough already.${prompt}
  13623: |-
    For as long as our journey continues, we face it on our own.
    Farewell, Lehko, ${name-player}...and thank you.${prompt}
  13624: |-
    ...Lehko.
    Twisted though its power may be, the bow can summon forth no evil that does not already reside within us.${prompt}
  13625: I have long believed that in the hands of one pure of heart and strong of will, it could have served its intended purpose...${prompt}
  13626: '...${prompt}'
  13627: |-
    The stone that brought rrruin upon us is born of nature, as are we all.
    In the end, it is but a mirrror to the soul of its wielder...${prompt}
  13628: |-
    It is not my place to question the ways of the motherland.
    But is this truly the Mithran way? To hunt to the ends of the world those who have taken a step astrrray?
    No matter how true their intentions, no matter how deep their remorse?${prompt}
  13629: |-
    Do we not strrrive to live in harmony with Mother Nature, with each other?
    No, it does not sit well with me...${prompt}
  13630: Nor I, Nhev... Nor I.${prompt}
  13631: What, trrruly, is “sin”?${prompt}
  13632: |-
    Those who judge us have found their answer.
    Perhaps someday we “sinners” will find an answer of our own.${prompt}
  13633: |-
    What's the matter, ${name-player}? You look as if you've seen a ghost.
    Fear not, for this is one bow I haven't the power to bend.${prompt}
  13634: Still, it never hurts to keep a few powerful pieces on hand as the endgame draws near...don't you think?${prompt}
  13635: |-
    Ah ha, but I jest. No, this bow just holds a cerrrtain sentimental value to me, you see.
    Given the chance, I simply couldn't let it go.${prompt}
  13636: |-
    At any rrrate, you've proven yourself a loyal friend and ally once more.
    Here, have this ${item-singular: 0[2]} for your trrroubles.${prompt}
  13637: |-
    Meow! I've got a present for my bestest friend!
    You'll take it, won't you? Pretty pretty please?${prompt}
  13638: |-
    Meowmmy and I are going to a place called Jeuno!
    Come visit us someday, okay?${prompt}
  13639: |-
    Oh, ${name-player}!
    Finished your business with Master Lehko, I see.${prompt}
  13640: Hm? Frrriends of yours, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13641: Curious. I've not seen their faces before...${prompt}
  13642: |-
    Hail, merrrchant!
    Where does the road lead you?${prompt}
  13643: We strrrike for Jeuno.${prompt}
  13644: |-
    The Duchy lies in shambles after the recent beastman attack.
    Homes rrrazed to the ground, families huddling in the streets as they forrrage for what scraps of food they can find.${prompt}
  13645: |-
    Though I feel for their plight, I cannot deny that it makes for prrrofitable times for those in my trade.
    I've even received a substantial order directly from the Ducal Army.${prompt}
  13646: |-
    An errand calls us to Jeuno as well.
    Could we trrrouble you to take us along?${prompt}
  13647: As you see, I travel with my child, and the roads these days are not safe for one of her tenderrr years.${prompt}
  13648: |-
    Cerrrtainly! I'd welcome the company.
    You're a cute little one, aren't ya?${prompt}
  13649: Meow!${prompt}
  13650: I have you this time...sinner!${prompt}
  13651: |-
    That garb...!
    A Mithran Tracker!?${prompt}
  13652: What--!?${prompt}
  13653: |-
    Well, well. If it isn't Perih of the Azure Bow.
    Still drrragging your paws in this wrrretched backwater, I see.${prompt}
  13654: |-
    When will you come to your senses and go home to Elshimo?
    You know that this land holds nothing for you save death and sufferrring.${prompt}
  13655: |-
    Your concern is touching, but it was always a bit too sweltry there for my liking.
    The more temperrrate climes on these shores suit me.${prompt}
  13656: |-
    Hmph. I shall return for you another day.
    Today, I pursue more urrrgent quarry...${prompt}
  13657: |-
    Shikaree...
    She says she's found the “sinner”...?${prompt}
  13658: |-
    Wait a minute...
    Lehko...? Lehko Habhoka!${prompt}
  13659: |-
    That day, ten years ago...
    Could he be...the son!?${prompt}
  13660: Perih? What's gotten into you all of a sudden?${prompt}
  13661: Lehko Habhoka... What is it you trrruly seek?${prompt}
  13662: |-
    ${name-player}! Drrrop some of that stuff you're carrying and take this ${item-singular: 0[2]} off my hands already, will ya?
    What in the world could this be used for, anyway...?${prompt}
  13663: |-
    Oh, ${name-player}. Lehko wanted me to give you this ${item-singular: 0[2]} as a reward for your brrravery.
    Lighten your burden and take it, will ya?
    And rest up while you can. Our fierrrcest battle still awaits.${prompt}
  13664: ''
  13665: |-
    There you are, ${name-player}!
    I've been scouring the streets for hourrrs trying to find you!${prompt}
  13666: The Warlock Warlord and his reconnaissance squad have just returned bearing grrrim news from Valdeaunia.${prompt}
  13667: He's about to hold an urrrgent defense briefing, and all mercenaries have been summoned to--${prompt}
  13668: '...I repeataru, by decree of the Warlock Warlord, a state of emergency has been declared for all wards of the capital.'
  13669: |-
    Civilians: stay calm, do not panic, and proceed in an orderly-worderly fashion to the designated sheltaru in Heavens Tower.
    Active combatants are to report to their commanding officer for immediate briefing.
  13670: |-
    ...You hearrrd that, ${name-player}.
    There's not a moment to lose!${prompt}
  13671: Ourrr apologies for the delay.${prompt}
  13672: |-
    ...And this is how we stand.
    Two enemy battalions bear down on the Federation even as we speak.${prompt}
  13673: |-
    The first is a cadre of the Dark Kindred, the elite guard of the Shadow Lord himself.
    Like the fiends that razed Karugo-Narugo, but twice as fearrrsome, if our scouts speak true.${prompt}
  13674: |-
    We'll also be welcoming a flock of crows to the festivities.
    The six regiments of the Senary Wing raise siege turrets on the outskirts of their Oztrojan nest, where they are joined by the Manifest's own Forbidden Guard.${prompt}
  13675: |-
    Their movements are measured and deliberate, as if each is matching the itinerary of the other.
    They'll be convening on the march southward, I'd wagerrr.${prompt}
  13676: It will not be long before they are upon us.${prompt}
  13677: |-
    But to launch a preemptive strike would only deprive us of what precious few advantages we possess.
    No, we shall hold them here. We defend Windurst with our lives.${prompt}
  13678: |-
    The enemy will come by way of Sarutabaruta and the port.
    War Warlocks. Make immediately for Windurst Waters and take formation as directed.
    It is there that our battle will be won.${prompt}
  13679: |-
    The foe we face is unpredictable.
    Even should the tide of battle seem to turn in your favor, lull yourselves not into a false sense of security, but be ever ready to adapt to the movements of your adversary.${prompt}
  13680: |-
    We will need all our strrrength and flawless cooperation to keep the Shadow Lord's fiends at bay.
    All Mithran Mercenary units are to join the War Warlocks and solidify the perimeter defense.${prompt}
  13681: |-
    ...With one exception.
    Romaa!${prompt}
  13682: '!?${prompt}'
  13683: |-
    You and your Cobras have proven yourselves the most verrrsatile of our units.
    I would have you on the front lines, to meet our enemy's initial charge.${prompt}
  13684: |-
    You are to take formation outside Odin's Gate, in West Sarutabaruta.
    Brrring down an enemy commander or two, disrupt their leadership and lower their morale, and the fight will be that much the easier.${prompt}
  13685: Good grrrief. Just when I thought your schemes couldn't get any more rrreckless.${prompt}
  13686: You object?${prompt}
  13687: |-
    Nah, we wouldn't have it any other way!
    Rrright, girls!?${prompt}
  13688: |-
    Very well.
    Then you have your orders--hm?${prompt}
  13689: Ah! Begging-wegging your pardon, sirs...${prompt}
  13690: |-
    What is this intrrrusion?
    This is a confidential briefing!${prompt}
  13691: |-
    Truly-wuly sorry I am, M-Master Lehko, sir.
    It's justaru that... It's Minister Karaha-Baruha, sir.
    He's...surfaced.${prompt}
  13692: '!?${prompt}'
  13693: Lead him in at once!${prompt}
  13694: It's really him...!${prompt}
  13695: Egads! He's as pale as a wightaru...${prompt}
  13696: |-
    Well met, friends!
    I am sorry if my extended absence has caused undue concern.${prompt}
  13697: |-
    What's this!? The hermit minister lives!?
    You were cooped up in that musty-wusty laboratory of yours for so long I figured there was nothing left of you but dustaru and robes!${prompt}
  13698: |-
    Always a pleasure to see you as well, Zonpa-Zippa!
    And what of your Cardians? Are they ready for battle?${prompt}
  13699: |-
    Bwahahaha! It would seem the moldy-wold on your cap has gone straight to your brain!
    You should know that the prodigious intellect of the great Zonpa-Zippa knows no limitaru!
    A stronger army of automata the world has never seen!${prompt}
  13700: |-
    Warlock Warlord.
    It is my pleasure to announce that my research, at long last, reaches completion.${prompt}
  13701: |-
    Excellent. We have but a moment of calm before the storm.
    Rest your mind, and ready yourself fully for the task ahead.${prompt}
  13702: |-
    Very well. You all have your orders.
    To your positions! Dismissed!${prompt}
  13703: A moment, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13704: Your questioning gaze has not escaped me.${prompt}
  13705: |-
    I will not ask what you may have seen.
    No, I ask you only to trust me, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13706: |-
    Place your trust in Robel-Akbel?
    ${selection-lines}
    I shall, unwaveringly.
    ...${prompt}
  13707: |-
    You have my thanks.
    Listen well, for this will be the last request I make of you.${prompt}
  13708: |-
    ...I see.
    Then do this not for me, but for Windurst.
    In either event, it will be the last request I make of you.${prompt}
  13709: You are, I imagine, acquainted with magicite.${prompt}
  13710: Perhaps, in your travels, you have acquainted yourself with a substance called magicite.${prompt}
  13711: Resembling a crystal, but possessing a power even more fearsome...${prompt}
  13712: |-
    ${name-player}.
    I would have you deliver three shards of magicite here to me.
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}, and ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}.${prompt}
  13713: In chambers deep, where the baleful shadows of darkness have long since vanquished the light...it is there they lie.${prompt}
  13714: |-
    Three chambers where none--save you--may travel.
    I need not explain further.${prompt}
  13715: |-
    What purpose will they serve?
    Bring them to me, and I shall see that all your questions are answered.${prompt}
  13716: I await your return, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13717: |-
    Hm? On another top-secretaru mission for the Warlock Warlord, are we?
    Something about a magic-wagic stone?${prompt}
  13718: |-
    Oh, looky-wook who's back.
    You'd best hurry in. Robel-Akbel's waiting for you, and we both know he's not a patientaru man!${prompt}
  13719: ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13720: |-
    I know I am not an easy master. Despite this, you have served me loyal and true.
    For this, you have my thanks.${prompt}
  13721: |-
    We stand on the eve of reckoning.
    Our age-old struggle with the beastmen shall draw to a close, and with it, one chapter of history.
    Before we go forth to meet our fates, I would share with you...my secret.${prompt}
  13722: |-
    What I am about to say is known to Lehko and none other.
    I trust you will see that it remains that way.${prompt}
  13723: |-
    It is as you surmise. I, like you, have traveled here from an age yet to come.
    ...From Vana'diel's future.${prompt}
  13724: |-
    But the future I call home is not the one you know.
    No, in my Windurst, the Star Sibyl has long since fallen to the clutches of darkness.
    The once-majestic branches of the Great Star Tree sag, withered and dying...${prompt}
  13725: 'Many years have I lived with bitter remorse as my only companion, my heart haunted by a single thought: “if only I could have saved her...”${prompt}'
  13726: Until, by a stroke of what can only be called fortune, I found myself with the chance to return here--to the past--to set right that which had gone so terribly wrong.${prompt}
  13727: My long-awaited chance...to rewrite the pages of history.${prompt}
  13728: Armed with the knowledge that Warlock Warlord Robel-Akbel fell in the First Battle of Windurst, it was no great task to take control of this nation and assume my role on this grand stage.${prompt}
  13729: That he was an intensely private man known to shun public appearances made it that much the easier.${prompt}
  13730: |-
    My face concealed, I returned from the battlefield upon which he had perished.
    Who would think to question my identity?${prompt}
  13731: |-
    You look as if you have something to say, ${name-player}.
    Well? Speak your mind.${prompt}
  13732: |-
    What concerns you?
    ${selection-lines}
    The original Robel-Akbel.
    Your true identity.${prompt}
  13733: |-
    He was possessed of great powers, of this there is no doubt.
    But he was perhaps a bit too trusting for his own good...${prompt}
  13734: I can see the gears turning in your head, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13735: You would believe that I had a hand in his demise?${prompt}
  13736: |-
    ...My true identity?
    What would you have me say, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13737: I am but a sad fool who would brandish his half-cocked schemes in an impudent rebellion against history, all for the love of a single woman. To say more would only render my humiliation complete.${prompt}
  13738: |-
    No matter. You are free to speculate as you wish.
    Such trifling details are soon to be buried deep in the sands of time.${prompt}
  13739: |-
    Let us return to the matter at hand.
    I intend to channel my own magical energies to ensure Karaha-Baruha's safety during the summoning.
    The magicite you brought me shall act as a conduit.${prompt}
  13740: |-
    A sound plan, yet not likely to escape the notice of our friends from the future.
    No, we can expect them to do all in their power to seize the energy for their own foul purposes...${prompt}
  13741: |-
    ${name-player}, listen to me.
    When all is done, you and Lehko must--${prompt}
  13742: |-
    My apologies.
    Might I have a moment of your time, Warlock Warlord?${prompt}
  13743: Of course.${prompt}
  13744: |-
    ...So we meet again.
    ${name-player}, it was?${prompt}
  13745: |-
    Such a curious ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] you are.
    Yes, there can be no doubt...${prompt}
  13746: |-
    I suspected as much from the moment I met you.
    You have come here from another world. No, another--${prompt}
  13747: |-
    Ah, but it hardly matters now.
    No, there is but one thing I would ask of you...${prompt}
  13748: Where you hail from, do the people of Windurst live in happiness?${prompt}
  13749: |-
    Do they live in happiness?
    ${selection-lines}
    They do.
    ...${prompt}
  13750: '...${prompt}'
  13751: |-
    I see.
    Thank you for your candor.${prompt}
  13752: |-
    ${name-player}. The hour draws near.
    Romaa and the Cobras ready themselves in West Sarutabaruta as we speak.
    It is time you joined them.${prompt}
  13753: How do we stand, Minister?${prompt}
  13754: |-
    Quite well, Warlock Warlord. Quite well.
    I have reviewed my calculations over and again, and can find no flaws of which to speak.${prompt}
  13755: |-
    Needless to say, with such a complex invocation, there are countless variables at play.
    You may rest assured, though, that all possible contingencies have been accounted for.${prompt}
  13756: |-
    Above all else, it will come down to my strength of spirit.
    Have I within me the courage to confront my most deeply held terrors and emerge with heart and mind intact?${prompt}
  13757: |-
    I will be frank with you, Warlock Warlord.
    I am not, by nature, a fearful man.
    But as I came to unravel the riddle of your identity, I became frightened--frightened to the very core of my soul.${prompt}
  13758: '...${prompt}'
  13759: I should have known it would be impossible to conceal the truth from you forever.${prompt}
  13760: '...!${prompt}'
  13761: Yes...yes...so it is as I thought!${prompt}
  13762: |-
    My summoning of the Great Beast did not proceed as planned.
    I...failed us.${prompt}
  13763: |-
    I could not save Windurst from its fate of destruction.
    I...failed us.${prompt}
  13764: |-
    This time, though, will be different.
    We will succeed. We must.${prompt}
  13765: |-
    Oh, yes. Hearing ${name-player}'s words just now has freed me from all doubt.
    There can be no question. We shall emerge victorious.${prompt}
  13766: |-
    Indeed.
    Hearing ${name-player}'s words just now has instilled me with newfound resolve.
    We have no other choice.${prompt}
  13767: Let us win back our rightful future, Warlock Warlord Robel-Akbel.${prompt}
  13768: No. I should say--
  13769: Warlock Warlord, sir!${prompt}
  13770: |-
    News from Karugo-Narugo, sir!
    The enemy is on the move in Aragoneu!${prompt}
  13771: |-
    Understood.
    Minister, it is time.${prompt}
  13772: |-
    Yes, Warlock Warlord.
    Let us go.${prompt}
  13773: |-
    Cobras are to rrreport to West Sarutabaruta, just outside Odin's Gate.
    That means you too, ${name-player}! On the double!${prompt}
  13774: Is it...over at last?${prompt}
  13775: '!?'
  13776: |-
    What mockery is this...?
    Brought to heel by mortal manikins?${prompt}
  13777: O, my piteous brother beast, it grieves me to see you fall so far...${prompt}
  13778: |-
    Where's the Warlock Warlord!?
    Quickly, we must--
  13779: '!?'
  13780: Urgh...!
  13781: --nnngh...
  13782: Wh-what's happening to them!?
  13783: Grrraaaaa...rrrggghhhhhh...
  13784: No...it couldn't be.${prompt}
  13785: Even with their powers combined...were they unable to tame the beast?${prompt}
  13786: |-
    Does fate refuse to be alterrred without demanding due sacrifice?
    After all this, have we...failed?${prompt}
  13787: |-
    No, it's not over yet!
    I'll take back our rrrightful future...by my own hand!${prompt}
  13788: '...Lehko, no!'
  13789: |-
    Stop this madness!
    Have you taken leave of your senses!?${prompt}
  13790: Stand back, Perih!
  13791: |-
    This is the Warlock Warlord's own wish!
    I sworrre an oath, that if it came to this...${prompt}
  13792: I would bring down our foe and the Great Beast with them...by any means!${prompt}
  13793: What!?${prompt}
  13794: |-
    Snivelling smoothskins, hear well these words.
    Though you claim victory today, your fate has long since been sealed.${prompt}
  13795: |-
    We await you in Oztroja.
    It is there the age-old struggle between our people shall come to its predestined close.
  13796: Grrrrrraaarrrggghhh...!!!
  13797: Does the beast go with them...?
  13798: What was that monstrrrous thing?${prompt}
  13799: |-
    That was the Great Beast Fenrir.
    Along with the Warlock Warlord and Karaha-Baruha...or what rrremains of them.${prompt}
  13800: |-
    For all their power, they could not tame the beast's fury.
    Their spirits consumed whole, together they form a mindless juggernaut that knows not where or why it rrrages.${prompt}
  13801: Wh-what!?${prompt}
  13802: |-
    Lehko.
    I'll be taking this from you now.${prompt}
  13803: But--${prompt}
  13804: No bow of such crrraftsmanship should be made to suffer the grip of an amateur.${prompt}
  13805: |-
    Besides, I see no need for you to bearrr your mother's burden.

    But there's no time to pat each other on the back.
    No, we must strike while the irrron is hot.${prompt}

    Perih! Romaa! Regroup as soon as you're able and make for Meriphataud with speed!
    The crows' nest shall be beset by a bed of vipers.${prompt}

    Now it is left to us to see that his loss was not in vain!
    War Warlocks, form two regiments of equal strength!${prompt}

    One unit remains here to guard against a return visit by our feathered frrriends.
    The other shall strike north to Valdeaunia. Our allies fight bravely, but they cannot win the battle alone.${prompt}
  13824: |-
    It was your commander's dying wish that his loss not stir undue panic in the hearts of his countrymen.

    Though it pains me, it seems you'll have your way.
    I've decided to stand aside and watch the saga play out of its own accorrrd.${prompt}

    Fate itself has seen fit to relieve me of my task.

    The Yagudo aren't known to take prrrisoners.

  13838: |-
    Now do you understand, Lehko?
    You will answer for your sins. Not to me, but to the very world around you.

    ...But I fear our task is not over.
    Perhaps you're wondering just what it was the Warlock Warlord meant to ask of you back at Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  13842: His final request to the two of us, no doubt the only people in this world that he can call frrriends.${prompt}
  13843: We must take his life, ${name-player}.
  13844: |-
    He knew from the beginning that this was how it would end.
    The power of the moon and stars cannot be allowed to fall into the clutches of darkness.${prompt}
  13845: And so we must strike him from the pages of history...erase him, and all traces of the future from which he came.${prompt}
  13846: |-
    He intends to turn to dust, to be swept away by the winds of time.
    And all his dark secrets with him...${prompt}
  13847: |-
    The bloody annals of war...
    A ruthless, stonehearted commander...
    Memories of a future ruled by shadow and rrruin...

    The “true” future has no place for any of these.
    The man we know as Robel-Akbel knows this full well.

    The final stage of our journey calls us to Oztroja, to the hearrrt of the beasts' den.${prompt}

    ...And this is one cat that doesn't intend to let her prrrey slip away!
    Soon as everyone's ready, we march for Castle Oztroja. Those birds'll be roastin' on spits before they rrrealize what hit 'em!${prompt}
  13856: Dhea! Have you seen to our preparations?${prompt}

  13859: Excellent.${prompt}
  13860: |-
    I see you're rrrarin' to go as well, ${name-player}.
    We'll set up camp in the Meriphataud Mountains, just out of the enemy's sight.${prompt}

    Listen. I probably don't need to be sayin' this to a veteran like you, but this'll prove to be our toughest battle before it's through.
    So ready yourself good and prrroper, and I'll see ya in the field!${prompt}
  13863: |-
    This is it, ${name-player}--the day that mercenaries like us live for.
    The crows have run rrroughshod over this poor nation for too long. It's time we returned the favor!${prompt}

    You gonna stand around here all day? Get your things together and make for the Meriphataud encampment!

    Get your things together and head for Meriphataud on the double. We can't afford to miss our chance to pounce!${prompt}

  13895: |-
    And I have decided thus: from this day forth, I bequeath a portion of our land to you.
    For as long as Windurst stands, the Mithran people will have a home here.${prompt}
  13896: Your Holiness. You honor us beyond our wildest imaginations...${prompt}
  13897: |-
    You can expect a good number of my girrrls to take you up on your offer.

    Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul.

  13956: 'At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}'
  13957: Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.${prompt}
  13958: That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.${prompt}

  13960: But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.${prompt}

  13965: |-
    Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands.
    For reasons yet to be determined, however, both infusion and enrichment can be safely performed by laymen, provided they're at a planar rift.${prompt}

  14771: 'While reports of Voidwalker encounters vary greatly in content, one thing is certain: the creatures are gaining in strength, a mounting threat that cannot be left unchecked.${prompt}'
  14772: In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning adventurers to lend their aid.${prompt}
  14773: As the nature of Voidwalker battles renders full-scale military operations unfeasible, we have chosen to stake our success on the mobility and versatility of adventurers.${prompt}
  14774: In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning soldiers of the Allied Forces to lend their aid.${prompt}
  14775: To be sure, there're those who question the wisdom of thinning our ranks in the face of the Shadow Lord's armies. But I assure you, friend, the Voidwalker threat is no less real.${prompt}

    These magicked stones are distributed in regular shipments from our Jeuno-based research team.

  14782: That's provided we have any in stock at all. Much time is required in imbuing them with requisite powers.${prompt}
  14783: The Voidwatch is an organization that exists for the sole purpose of protecting the world from extradimensional invaders we call “Voidwalkers.”${prompt}
  14784: Recognizing the graveness of this threat, the nations of the Middle Lands joined together in common cause and formed the Voidwatch.${prompt}
  14785: Helming the organization is the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, with the remaining three nations contributing resources for its operation.${prompt}
  14786: 'Possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt}'
  14787: It can be earned only through loyal service to your nation, and thus serves as a testimonial for your prowess.${prompt}
  14788: You would do well to obtain one if you haven't already done so.${prompt}
  14789: Affiliation with the Allied Forces of Altana is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt}
  14790: In other words, you must belong to the armed forces of one of the three nations.${prompt}
  14791: The enlistment procedure varies depending on nation. Those wishing to obtain a recommendation letter should pay visit to one of the military encampments surrounding Jeuno.${prompt}
  14792: When you battle a Voidwalker, you must do so as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of the dimension who has harnessed the powers of the voidstone and stratum abyssite.${prompt}
  14793: Bereft of these two objects, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.${prompt}
  14794: However, there are a few points all budding Voidwatchers should bear in mind.${prompt}
  14795: Most crucial of all, the extradimensional nature of being a Voidwatcher renders you isolated and unable to receive help from the outside world.${prompt}
  14796: Scientists attribute this to the dimensional misalignment that occurs. As people are ordinarily unable to see Voidwalkers, so too are they unable to see you.${prompt}
  14797: But you needn't concern yourself with the hows and whys of such matters. It would behoove you far more to become familiar with the workings of the “existential spectrum.”${prompt}
  14798: |-
    You see, each dimension is composed of an existential spectrum to which all things within are aligned.
    In turn, the spectrum is formed of five lights: blue, red, yellow, green, and white.${prompt}
  14799: The alignment of these lights between Voidwalker and Voidwatcher plays an important role in our efforts.${prompt}
  14800: To elaborate, the act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning ourselves to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  14801: Now, while Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with these creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  14802: Compensating measures, however, have been developed to allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe.${prompt}
  14803: One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items,” while another entails performing certain actions against the enemy.${prompt}
  14804: Both methods aim to manipulate the alignment value of individual lights to various ends.${prompt}
  14805: All five lights influence the contents of the treasure chest which appears at the successful end of battle.${prompt}
  14806: Our researchers have succeeded in determining what manner of benefits are associated with each light.${prompt}
  14807: For instance, improving blue spectral alignment is known to produce greater quantities of spoils.${prompt}
  14808: In contrast, manipulating red spectral alignment reportedly enhances the quality of individual items--potions becoming hi-potions, and so forth.${prompt}
  14809: Yellow and green, on the other hand, influence experience gain and cruor yield respectively.${prompt}
  14810: If you wish to know more about the curious red substance we call cruor, you need but ask.${prompt}
  14811: |-
    Lastly, we have white spectral alignment, which is unique even in this company.
    It has been determined to affect the appearance of transdimensional objects such as atmacite and periapt.${prompt}
  14812: Research regarding these artifacts is still ongoing.${prompt}
  14813: Lastly, be reassured that there're no known negative effects of manipulating spectral alignment. We unreservedly encourage all Voidwatch operatives to endeavor towards maximum alignment.${prompt}
  14814: Ascent items are unique objects that can be used to manipulate the spectral alignment of corresponding lights in the existential spectrum.${prompt}
  14815: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are representative of such items.
    They're the pride and joy of our Jeuno-based research team, who'd have folk believe they're the greatest inventions since airships.${prompt}
  14816: (Just between you and me, though, it is Far Eastern scientists that pioneered the technology they're based upon.)${prompt}
  14817: They're not the only means by which we manipulate spectral alignment, mind you. Similar results can be achieved by performing specific actions against the enemy.${prompt}
  14818: Truth be told, much is still shrouded in mystery. What actions will produce the desired effect is something you will have to discover for yourself through trial and error.${prompt}
  14819: Defeating a Voidwalker will cause a mysterious pyxis to emerge at the selfsame planar rift whence the creature was felled.${prompt}
  14820: 'Such riftworn pyxides exhibit a most peculiar characteristic: the content they bear reportedly changes depending on who glimpses within.${prompt}'
  14821: |-
    Our scientists conjecture that this is due to some trick of spectral alignment. As with numerous other mysteries surrounding Voidwalkers, however, I highly doubt they have even an inkling of understanding.
    But I digress...${prompt}
  14822: Only one combatant need possess a voidstone for all party or alliance members to do battle with a Voidwalker. Of the other squad members only stratum abyssite is required.${prompt}
  14823: |-
    As always seems to be the case, however, there is a catch.
    Pyxides have been observed to yield less spoils for combatants without a voidstone of their own.${prompt}
  14824: It scarce needs be said, but it would be to your benefit to have both the aforementioned items readied before taking on a Voidwalker.${prompt}
  14825: |-
    Lastly, a warning: pyxides will eventually vanish if left untouched overlong.
    Our scientists have put forth the theory of normalizing spatial dissonance, but you needn't concern yourself with their mumbo-jumbo.${prompt}
  14826: Just see to it that your hard-earned spoils are claimed in good time, and things will be rosy for all involved.${prompt}
  14827: 'The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is a magicked object produced by the Voidwatch''s Jeuno-based research wing.${prompt}'
  14828: Its innocuous appearance belies the immense power it holds...the power to render Voidwalkers visible to its bearer.${prompt}
  14829: The stone achieves this feat by realigning our existential spectrum to that of the creature.${prompt}
  14830: I shall explain the process in layman's terms for your benefit. No need to thank me--I merely perform my duty.${prompt}
  14831: I want you to visualize two canvases, each the same distance from the other. Yes, as two separate objects are normally wont to be.${prompt}
  14832: Imagine you and I standing on one of the canvases--what else does one do with a canvas but stand on it, yes?${prompt}
  14833: Now, imagine Voidwalkers standing on the other canvas, doing whatever it is Voidwalkers do. Destroying things and behaving with utter impropriety, no doubt.${prompt}
  14834: |-
    Being on two different canvases, it follows that we cannot touch the Voidwalkers, let alone see them.
    Actually, that doesn't explain why we can't see the Voidwalkers...unless it's a magical canvas they're on that makes all things upon it invisible! Yes, that'll serve!${prompt}
  14835: And this brings us full circle back to the voidstone. I want you to think of it as a magical paintbrush that we use to...grapple ourselves over to the Voidwalkers' canvas. Thence the fighting begins.${prompt}
  14836: |-
    I trust you now have a rudimentary understanding of the process. That's all you need, really.
    Leave the fractal geometry to the fractal geometrists, I always say.${prompt}
  14837: |-
    As long as you remember the canvas and the paintbrush--that's the voidstone--you cannot go astray.
    Now, to apprise you of more practical matters...${prompt}
  14838: Twenty hours (Earth time) is required to produce a stone and imbue it with the necessary magicks, although word is that this may be shortened as research progresses.${prompt}
  14839: |-
    Mind you, this isn't the only variety of stone you'll be needing.
    There exists another: stratum abyssite.${prompt}
  14840: |-
    Whereas the voidstone serves as a power source, acting as a compass for channeling that power is stratum abyssite.
    Only by using the two in conjunction can we achieve our objectives.${prompt}
  14841: |-
    Are you familiar with ${color: 5}voiddust${color: 1}?
    Put simply, it is a granular substance from which voidstones may be fabricated.${prompt}
  14842: |-
    As I explained, significant time is required to produce a voidstone from scratch.
    Provide me with voiddust, however, and I can fashion a stone for you in short order.${prompt}
  14843: |-
    The same comrades of ours who stock ascent items may also furnish you with voiddust.
    Why do they not fabricate the stones themselves, or deliver the dust directly to me?
    Shush! The Voidwatch works in mysterious ways, and it would behoove you to inquire no further.${prompt}
  14844: |-
    At any rate, should you manage to obtain any ${color: 5}voiddust${color: 1} in your travels, you need only return here and trade it to me.
    Simple enough, wouldn't you say?${prompt}
  14845: Furthermore, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.${prompt}
  14846: Based on the evolutionary state of your stratum abyssite, the Voidwatch will direct you to a suitable operation area.${prompt}
  14847: If you wish to have your stone analyzed, simply present it to an atma refiner.${prompt}

    Planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space--have manifested across the land.
    The Voidwalker hordes roam beyond, unchecked and ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt}
  14849: By invoking the power of stratum abyssite, it is possible to battle the fell creatures as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of our dimension.${prompt}
  14850: Those also possessed of a voidstone will find their Voidwatcher experience greatly enhanced.${prompt}
  14851: Alone, however, stratum abyssite serves no purpose; only when used in conjunction with a voidstone can its powers be unleashed.${prompt}
  14852: Hence, at least one member of your squad--be it party or alliance--must possess a voidstone in order to arrange a confrontation with a Voidwalker.${prompt}
  14853: Keep this fact in mind at all times.${prompt}
  14854: It is not known when the planar rifts first manifested. Some say they've always been there, while others claim recent events have triggered their appearance.${prompt}
  14855: If only we could return to the past, perhaps we could shed some light upon this mystery...${prompt}
  14856: Obtainable by defeating Voidwalkers, cruor is an energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt}

  14858: |-
    As far as our researchers can tell, however, it's inanimate like most well-behaved plants.
    There's no fear of cruor suddenly springing to life in your palms.${prompt}

    Namely, the infusion and enrichment of atmacite.
    If you wish to learn about these two processes, you need but ask an atmacite refiner, our experts on such matters.${prompt}
  14861: As cruor is a vital aspect of our operations, the Voidwatch is always looking to procure more. Should you have any excess cruor, we would be glad to take it off your hands and offer you useful items in exchange.${prompt}
  14862: Abyssite is the name given to a mysterious stone that assumes various forms and colors, the roles they serve likewise manifold in nature.${prompt}
  14863: Of the copious varieties thus far discovered, there exist those called “periapt”--lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt}
