    The effects of controlling regions.
    Regions controlled by other nations.
    Regions under beastman control.${prompt}
  6740: All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt}
  6741: Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt}
  6742: Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt}
  6743: So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt}
  6744: |-
    Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.
    They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt}
  6745: Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt}
  6746: Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt}
  6747: |-
    So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.
    We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt}
  6748: |-
    You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.
    Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt}
  6749: |-
    Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.
    The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt}

    You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}

    We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  6752: |-
    You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.
    Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt}
  6753: Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt}
  6754: |-
    You also receive rank points for completing missions.
    Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt}
  6755: |-
    You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.
    Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}
  6756: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt}
  6757: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt}
  6758: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt}
  6759: Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt}
  6760: Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt}
  6761: Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt}
  6762: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt}
  6763: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt}
  6764: |-
    Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.
    If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt}
  6765: If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt}
  6766: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt}
  6767: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt}
  6768: There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt}
  6769: |-
    Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.

  7384: Then, is it true that the first prince to quell the Orcs of Ghelsba will inherit the Kingdom?${prompt}
  7385: Bah. Simply taking Ghelsba won't make anybody king.${prompt}
  7386: Aye, but he'd be a step closer to the throne! Still, it must be in their blood to quarrel.${prompt}
  7387: It's been twenty years since the Great War, and the king is old. His little princes have grown into men, now...${prompt}
  7388: Yet I hear they bicker over which will be king. A sadder fate has never befell a kingdom, if it's true.${prompt}
  7389: Who knows? And they were such good brothers in their youth.${prompt}
  7390: Aye, 'tis true that San d'Oria joined Windurst, Bastok, and Jeuno in war twenty years ago. We slew the Shadow Lord, and drove back his hordes!${prompt}
  7391: I say “we,” but what did the absent-minded Windurstians and granite-licking Bastokers do? Nothing! And don't get me started on those upstart fishermen from Jeuno!${prompt}
  7392: Our knights triumphed against darkness that day. San d'Oria saved this world from the clutches of the Shadow Lord!${prompt}

  7437: 'Hello there, I am Altiret. I''m here to catch things on the airship hulls: fiends, and worse.${prompt}'

  7444: Well, I'll give it to you anyway. Perhaps it will be of some use.${prompt}

  7469: I walked about so much yesterday, I could have dropped it anywhere.${prompt}
  7470: Well, go on! We can't help you unless you say where you went!${prompt}
  7471: Yesterday morning, I was at the South Auction House, then I went to the outpost in West Ronfaure. I met a trader there.${prompt}
  7472: I took him all the way to the La Theine Plateau. On the way back through West Ronfaure, I passed Knightwell. Then I came back to the city through the Westgate.${prompt}
  7473: Say, you don't think you could find that document for me, could you? I'd reward you, of course. What say you?${prompt}

  7475: You'll go find it for me? That's a relief. You have my thanks, adventurer.${prompt}
  7476: Where could I have dropped it? Was it the South Auction House, or the outpost in West Ronfaure where I met the trader?${prompt}
  7477: Or maybe I dropped it when I escorted him to the La Theine Plateau... Or when I passed by Knightwell in West Ronfaure, or even near the Westgate!${prompt}
  7478: What? You've found it! The missing bond! My reputation is saved!${prompt}

  7494: Fine. Very well, I'll have to go apologize to Regine over at the Magicmart in person. Take more care, next time.${prompt}

  7518: Huh? I didn't order this! Here, take it back.${prompt}

  7603: Alas, what a terrible sight they were! I still shiver just thinking of them!${prompt}
  7604: If heroes hadn't come forth to stop the Shadow Lord...who knows what would have become of this world!${prompt}
  7605: Beyond lies the residential area.${prompt}
  7606: The airship docks are down this corridor. Not that they'd let a two-gil guard and a starry-eyed adventurer on one of those airships, eh?${prompt}
  7607: But they cannot hold us back! Work hard, and our day will come. We shall ride that airship together!${prompt}
  7608: A pickpocket? No, not round here.${prompt}
  7609: This corridor leads to an auction house. Prince Pieuje ordered their construction. But if you ask me, such places do not become our grand city.${prompt}
  7610: A proud Elvaan would not peddle wares like some Hume merchant... How times have changed!${prompt}
  7611: But if you must go, the far corridor there leads to the residential area. After all, even knights must rest!${prompt}
  7612: Hmm? Someone suspicious? Now that you mention it, I did see a woman dart up the western stair, that way.${prompt}
  7613: Below these stairs lies the auction house. Some may grumble about proud San d'Orians reduced to squabbling merchants, but I care not.${prompt}

  7615: A pickpocket? Now there's a scoundrel unworthy of San d'Oria! It wasn't an Elvaan, was it?${prompt}
  7616: This passage leads to the airship docks. There's a magic shop if you take the corridor on the right there.${prompt}
  7617: Magic is the specialty of the Federation of Windurst, of course. We have some, but for true sorcery you have to search there.${prompt}
  7618: Aye, pickpockets will get you if you don't watch yourself.${prompt}
  7619: Ahead lies the port, where airships are laden with goods for Jeuno. You'll find an auction house and the residential area, too.${prompt}
  7620: The Brugaire Consortium owns the cargo rooms there. They're on good terms with Monarlais Halver and the papsque, I hear.${prompt}
  7621: A pickpocket? Things sure have gotten rough around here. You watch yourself.${prompt}
  7622: Take this corridor if you're heading to Northern San d'Oria or Southern San d'Oria.${prompt}

  7625: Hey, that pickpocket just ran that way! Get after her, quick!${prompt}
  7626: Up ahead are the airship docks. The Grand Duchy of Jeuno runs all the airships, you know.${prompt}
  7627: Only those of good standing, or deep pockets, are allowed onboard. I can't see why you'd want to go there.${prompt}
  7628: The residential area is up these stairs. If you ask me, San d'Orians must cast aside the trappings of wealth.${prompt}
  7629: It's not knightly to sit on cushioned couches in gilt halls! No, we should sleep with the grass as our pillow, the dew our morning gown.${prompt}

    Mind you that one Orc under the belt does not a hero make!

    Normally, the Royal Knights of San d'Oria would be on the job already,

    Take the path before the Westgate, then turn right when the path splits in the forest. You'll find the outpost entrance up in the hills.${prompt}

    闇の王率いる、獣人たちの
    強大な力に対抗するため、ジュノが調停役となり

  7790: It's not true, is it? I couldn't bear another war like twenty years ago. Those were dark times for all of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7791: I'm scared... I'm very scared. My husband, my children, my friends...all the people I've come to know these twenty years. I will not lose them to another war!${prompt}
  7792: Heard the whispers, have you? The beastmen have a new leader. War is preparing!${prompt}
  7793: Ah, but any horde of beastmen will break upon these walls like water. Long live King Destin!${prompt}
  7794: Long live King Destin! Huh? Pickpockets? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something here?${prompt}
  7795: Orcs have been harassing us ever since they took West Ronfaure. Confound those beastmen!${prompt}
  7796: But where are the knights? They should have stomped their camps flat months ago, just like in the Great War.${prompt}
  7797: Confound them! Give me a sword and... Eh? A pickpocket? Do I look like I hang out with that sort?${prompt}
  7798: |-
    ここは立入禁止だ。
    わかったら、さっさと向こうへ行け。${prompt}
  7799: Well, well... A new recruit! I was once an adventurer myself. Mind you, that was a long time ago...${prompt}
  7800: Aye, there hasn't been a war since the beastmen rose twenty years ago. I tried to settle down, and sold off my armor for some city clothes.${prompt}
  7801: But this son of adventurers couldn't give up his heritage for steady work. Not for lack of trying, mind you!${prompt}
  7802: Always got into fights with superiors, or quit at the first hint of boredom. Come to think of it, I've gotten nowhere, have I?${prompt}
  7803: I won't complain, but San d'Oria's days of glory are gone forever.${prompt}
  7804: Our days of glory are gone forever.${prompt}

    Not now.${prompt}
  7807: I see, I see. Well, to each ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] own. You come back if you change your mind.${prompt}
  7808: That's the spirit! Now to business. I've got something I want you to take to the Tenshodo in Jeuno. ${prompt}
  7809: There's a bit of a story behind this one... But nothing that need concern you! You just take it to the Tenshodo for me.${prompt}
  7810: I'd bring it by foot, if I wasn't so sure it'd get broken. Airship's the way to go... But then there's customs to deal with.${prompt}
  7811: You'll get it through, won't you? If they catch you, they'll only confiscate the goods and keep you from flying for a while. No worries! I'll pay good, I will.${prompt}
  7812: All you have to do is deliver some goods by airship to the Tenshodo in Jeuno.${prompt}
  7813: |-
    How about it?
    ${selection-lines}
    Let's do it.
    I don't think so.${prompt}
  7814: That's what I like to hear! Just hop on the airship to Jeuno, and make sure this gets to Yin Pocanakhu at the Tenshodo there.${prompt}
  7815: And it might be best to wait until nightfall.${prompt}
  7816: You're doing yourself a disservice, not taking this job, you know. Come back if you change your mind.${prompt}
  7817: Just make the delivery to Yin Pocanakhu at the Tenshodo in Jeuno. Don't worry! If you're caught, they'll just suspend your Jeuno flight privileges a short while.${prompt}
  7818: But if you're still a touch worried, you might consider waiting until nightfall.${prompt}
  7819: You made it! You're a lucky one, then; they always seem to catch me. Oh, and your money, as promised!${prompt}
  7820: Eh, they caught you? Ah, just a stripe of bad luck, that's all. This business is like rolling dice.${prompt}
  7821: Sorry to put you in a fix, eh? But don't let it get you down! There's always next time!${prompt}
  7822: What? Damaged it, did you? Pay attention when I talk to you! Take it on the airship next time!${prompt}
  7823: I'll ask you again once you get your flight privileges back in Jeuno. Best lay low for now.${prompt}
  7824: What's this? A magic shop? Hmm...I could use a new line of work, and magic just might be the ticket!${prompt}
  7825: I heard that the Brugaire Consortium that runs these warehouses is looking for workers.${prompt}
  7826: They're one of San d'Oria's biggest trading companies...but I hear they're a little rough with their staff.${prompt}
  7827: And people say they smuggl--ahem! Wouldn't want a prospective employer to hear me saying that, now would I!${prompt}
  7828: What? A pickpocket? Hey! I may be a loafer, but I'm no thief!${prompt}
  7829: Are you confident in your faith? Somewhere out there lies the gate to eternal paradise.${prompt}
  7830: We are children of the Goddess of the Dawn. She is the mother of all living things, and Vana'diel is her cradle.${prompt}
  7831: I am Teilsa, one of the faithful. Ever do I seek the way to Paradise.${prompt}
  7832: 'If you lose your way, choose “Map” from your main menu. Here, let me give you this in exchange for your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  7833: Blessed are the believers. Always are we bathed in the light of the Goddess, and soothing is the sound of her song.${prompt}
  7834: Blessed are the believers, for spared are we her pain and sorrow. Her cold blade will never touch us.${prompt}
  7835: Soon you will see. Shadows of chaos will fall upon Vana'diel, and herald the coming of Crystal Warriors.${prompt}
  7836: 'The Goddess of the Dawn spoke: “He who fails to question his faith is blind. A believer without doubt will turn gold to lead.”${prompt}'
  7837: “I can only light thy candle; thou must carry thy own.”${prompt}
  7838: “I cannot lead thee, for thy path is thine alone. Let the light of thy candle guide thee.”${prompt}
  7839: “He who finds me at the journey's end...” That is all. No one knows what follows.${prompt}
  7840: But the day will come when all is revealed.${prompt}
  7841: Behold San d'Oria, city of legends! I've always wanted to come here and join a proud order of knights.${prompt}
  7842: They don't let raw recruits into the chateau, but no matter! I'll complete so many missions they'll make me a certified adventurer in no time!${prompt}
  7843: But first, I'll warm up on a few of those worms outside the city gates! You have to walk before you can fly, my friend.${prompt}
  7844: A magic shop? Oh, it's right near here. I'll go check it out sometime.${prompt}
  7845: A pickpocket!? Whew, my wallet's safe. It takes money to be an adventurer!${prompt}
  7846: I've told Fontoumant, so all you have to do is deliver the goods to Avandale as...${prompt}
  7847: Hey! There're some things best left unheard, stranger. I trust you'll be leaving... Now!${prompt}
  7848: Come on, man, I think we're a little over our heads here! Someone big over in Jeuno gave that to commemorate...${prompt}
  7849: H-hey! Who are you? I don't know what you heard, but this is Brugaire Consortium business! Top secret. Get lost.${prompt}
  7850: Hey! I may be a child, but I am the captain of the Royal Knights Youth Division!${prompt}
  7851: My troops...well, it's just me and my brother, but Orcs shiver at our name! It's true!${prompt}
  7852: Hey! Salute when you speak to me! I am second captain of the Royal Knights Youth Division! Don't make me use my nirvana slash on you!${prompt}
  7853: Maybe we could use you. You'd be just a private...but there is plenty of opportunity for advancement.${prompt}
  7854: My grandpa always said that only a thief would take other people's things! If I find that pickpocket... Wham! Wham!${prompt}
  7855: My grandpa always said that the only stuff thieves take are other people's things! If I find that pickpocket, he's chocobo-feed!${prompt}
  7856: Hmph. A new recruit, are you? Let me give you some advice. There's Orcs outside our walls, more now than ever.${prompt}
  7857: Best not to face them before you're ready. They're known to attack without warning... Nasty things!${prompt}
  7858: Heh. Fighting is good, but discretion is the better part of valor! Run back to the gates if you need to.${prompt}
  7859: That's called a strategic retreat, that is!${prompt}
  7860: Yeah, a tradegic stretreat!${prompt}
  7861: I'll never forget the Great War of twenty years ago. The kindred of the Shadow Lord... So many lives lost... My sons... Oh, my sons!${prompt}
  7862: I'll not let it happen again! Not while blood still flows through my veins!${prompt}
  7863: Every morning I pray to Altana. Please, I say, please let these days of peace go on, till that day when we can all laugh and say, “Life is grand...life is beautiful!”${prompt}
  7864: It seems everyone is worried about the Orcs these days. Something's going on, that's for certain!${prompt}
  7865: It's about time we marched on their camps, I say. We've put up with those Orcs long enough! We Elvaan must put them back in their place.${prompt}
  7866: I heard the Orcish camp in West Ronfaure is called Ghelsba. There are so many of them these days!${prompt}
  7867: And I've heard they kidnap people! It's horrible, just horrible.${prompt}
  7868: This is the first I've heard of a magic shop here in San d'Oria. Such arts have never been popular in the Kingdom.${prompt}
  7869: I am Maunadolace of the Temple Knights, on orders from the prince to watch the auction house. I would love to chat, but I'm on duty.${prompt}
  7870: A fine chocobo, is she not? My tried and true companion, mine since she was but a chick.${prompt}
  7871: Admittedly, I'd rather be out in the field, doing battle with fiends, not standing here monitoring...commerce.${prompt}
  7872: A pickpocket? I would have detained anyone suspicious coming this way.${prompt}
  7873: Heh-heh-heh... Don't tell anyone, but I found me a wallet! I'm lucky, I tell you, real lucky!${prompt}
  7874: Finders keepers, finders keepers. Wonder what's inside! Nah, I'll look later.${prompt}
  7875: What have I got here? Look, I can't read, but I takes what I gets, and you ain't getting it back!${prompt}
  7876: Sorry, but we're currently unable to issue World Passes.${prompt}

  8103: Truth be told, that's a matter of great contention between us. We've competed to see who's the better fisherman before, but could never agree on the results, you see.${prompt}

  8114: Good day. I am Joulet, and Gallijaux is my elder brother. Our mother likes to say we were born with fishing rods in our hands.${prompt}
  8115: We've always wondered who was the better angler...but never could agree on the results of our contests, no matter how many times we tried.${prompt}

    Welcome to the auction house.
    Do you have any questions about our establishment?${prompt}
  8130: |-
    What do you want to know?
    ${selection-lines}
    What is the auction house?
    How are auctions run?
    Are there any fees?
    Are there any limits?
    How do you check up on merchandise?
    How do you remove an item?
    My “Sales Status” list is full!
    Nothing right now.${prompt}
  8131: Auction houses can be found in all of Vana'diel's major cities. Here adventurers gather to bid on battle spoils, unwanted items, old armor...almost anything.${prompt}
  8132: Currently, the auction houses in Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno all work independently. Therefore, prices differ from city to city.${prompt}
  8133: Adventurers may use any auction house regardless of nationality.${prompt}
  8134: The first adventurer to bid at or above the asking price will automatically purchase the product.${prompt}
  8135: Once put up for auction, merchandise will remain there for a maximum of thirty weeks Vana'diel time (nine-and-a-half days Earth time).${prompt}
  8136: If merchandise does not sell within this time limit, it will be returned to the seller's current residence.${prompt}
  8137: Transaction fees are proportional to the amount for which an item is put up on auction. The method of calculating this fee is different for single items and stackable items.${prompt}
  8138: A transaction fee is collected when any merchandise is put up for auction. This fee is nonrefundable.${prompt}
  8139: The International Auction House Committee, or IAHC, has declared that a maximum of seven items may be put up for auction at one time.${prompt}
  8140: However, the IAHC has recently removed the limit to how many items one may purchase.${prompt}
  8141: A small amount of time is required before new merchandise appears on our bid list.${prompt}
  8142: Once an item appears on your “Sales Status” list, it may not immediately appear on the bid list. If you do not see your item on the bid list, try looking again at a later time.${prompt}
  8143: If you would like to withdraw an item from an auction, you must travel to the auction house, and select “Stop Sale” from the “Sales Status” menu.${prompt}
  8144: To remove an item from your “Sales Status” list, you must visit an auction counter to acknowledge the sale or return of your merchandise.${prompt}
  8145: Otherwise, previously sold or returned items will fill up your list and prevent you from selling any more merchandise.${prompt}
  8146: At any auction counter, open the “Sales Status” menu and acknowledge the transaction to clear it from the list.${prompt}
  8147: Press the confirm button to remove any transaction colored yellow (sold) or red (returned).${prompt}
  8148: Is there anything else you would like to know?${prompt}
  8149: In the past, many have amassed great wealth through the auction house. I hope you find fortune, too!${prompt}
  8150: I wonder who that beautiful young lass is waiting for every day and every night down by the docks...${prompt}
  8151: I dare you to go down there and ask her name. You think you could handle that?${prompt}
  8152: You've got to be joking! We're still on duty! Though I do get off in three hours...${prompt}
  8153: A fine tune it is. Never heard it before, but it somehow sounds familiar...${prompt}
  8154: I never thought I'd live to hear that melody again. Brings back memories, it does...${prompt}
  8155: You still haven't found the girl you're looking for?${prompt}
  8156: No, I have not...${prompt}
  8157: Don't worry. She'll turn up, I guarantee it. You'd have to be crazy not to be drawn by the sweet melody of Ulmia's harp.${prompt}
  8158: Hey, music-lady, you wouldn't happen to be looking for somebody, would you?${prompt}
  8159: Ah...y-yes I am!${prompt}
  8160: I am searching for a young girl. Her hair is light blue, and she is dressed in the theologian gowns of the Tavnazian Cathedral.${prompt}
  8161: |-
    Hmmm...

  8164: Kind traveler, do you know anything of the girl that the Duchy seeks?${prompt}
  8165: Yeah, well, it just happens to be that I'm looking for the same girl.${prompt}
  8166: Now whether that girl is the same girl you'rrre looking for...I don't know.${prompt}
  8167: '...${prompt}'
  8168: I do not mean to pry, but has Jeuno hired you to find the girl they are searching for?${prompt}
  8169: Does it look like I work for the Duchy? If that's what you want to believe, go rrright ahead. You Elvaan are all the same--only seeing what you want to see.${prompt}
  8170: '...${prompt}'
  8171: Hey, did you know that along with the girl's, there's another warrant out for the capture of some strrrange boy?${prompt}
  8172: How much do you want to bet that those two are togetherrr?${prompt}
  8173: |-
    I do not know...
    But if the girl you and I are searching for is the same person, I can tell you this: she is not one to run.${prompt}
  8174: |-
    Huh...
    Catching mice is what we Mithra live for, but it's turning out to look like this job is going to be a little differrrent.${prompt}
  8175: Oh well, I don't have time to play two games of cat and mouse, so I guess I'll just concentrrrate on the boy.${prompt}
  8176: |-
    Wait!
    What... What do you know of the boy?${prompt}
  8177: |-
    Hah hah...
    Music-lady, you should be careful about what you ask. The answerrr might just bite you back.${prompt}
  8178: '...${prompt}'
  8179: If the girl you are looking for is the same one I'm seeking, then we'll meet again.${prompt}
  8180: If you still want to know the answerrr to your question, then I guess it wouldn't hurt to tell you. Until next time...${prompt}

  8273: Is somebody making burritos, or something? Some people from the Tenshodo told me that these would sell, but I haven't had many customers.
  8274: Is there going to be a party, or something? Some people from the Tenshodo told me that these would sell, but I haven't had many customers.
  8275: I put blood, sweat, and tears into my work. Makes goodies really tasty!
  8276: Like, these dudes from the Tenshodo were like, “sell these beans,” so like, here I am. Are you gonna buy some beans, dude?
  8277: Like, these dudes from the Tenshodo were like, “sell these fireworks,” so like, here I am. But like, don't go using those things around my hair, dude.
  8278: |-
    Today, festival day!
    You must buy. You buy now.
  8279: I just can't understand what those people from the Tenshodo are thinking! Who would want to buy something that rots their teeth? You wouldn't...would you?
  8280: I just can't understand what those people from the Tenshodo are thinking! Who would want to buy something that blows up? You wouldn't...would you?
  8281: I would like to sell goods from the Elshimo Uplands, but I cannot, as it's under foreign control.${prompt}
  8282: Hello, friend! Can I interest you in specialty goods from the Elshimo Lowlands?${prompt}
  8283: Hey, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/miss]! How about some specialty goods from Kuzotz?${prompt}
  8284: My shipment is in! Would you like to see what has just arrived from the Elshimo Uplands?${prompt}
  8285: You hear more and more talk of the Dragon King Ranperre these days. They say that his top vassal was a dragoon. I wonder what ever happened to all the dragoons...${prompt}
  8286: I heard that to become a dragoon, you had to make a pact with a living wyvern. However, thanks to the dragonslayers, there aren't that many dragons left.${prompt}
  8287: The dragonslayers keep down the number of deadly dragons, but the number of dragoons can never go up. It's a sad, sad cycle.${prompt}
  8288: They say that King Ranperre's top vassal, the “Last of the Dragoons,” collapsed after a battle with a dragonslayer.${prompt}
  8289: I even heard a rumor that a new dragoon appeared in San d'Oria, but no one has ever seen him. Some even say that it is that Cyranuce, locked up in the dungeons.${prompt}
  8290: There's nothing to those rumors. If he really was a dragoon, why would he be in the Oubliette?${prompt}
  8291: You have a point...${prompt}
  8292: Hey, have you reached your quota for this week?${prompt}
  8293: |-
    N-no, not yet.
    I'm really gonna get it when the boss gets here. What am I gonna do?${prompt}
  8294: I know you have a lot to deal with at the moment, but I can't bail you out this time...${prompt}
  8295: How goes it? Making mountains of gil, you two? You know I've got no use for those who don't bring in the cash.${prompt}
  8296: |-
    Sure, Boss.
    Here, this week's profits.${prompt}
  8297: |-
    You're cutting it pretty close, there.
    Well, at least you're consistent. Keep it rolling in.${prompt}
  8298: And what about you? Meeting your quota, I trust?${prompt}
  8299: Uh, actually, Boss, I...${prompt}
  8300: "Hm? Are you trying to tell me you haven't met your quota? \nYou just had a baby, though, didn't you? Probably costs a fortune keeping the little one fed.${prompt}"
  8301: Y-yes, Boss.${prompt}
  8302: You know what you need to do, right?${prompt}
  8303: Meet my quota, Boss!${prompt}
  8304: |-
    Got it in one.
    I'll give you a little more time this week. But if this happens again, you and your kid'll be out on the street!${prompt}
  8305: Good Goddess...${prompt}
  8306: What're you gonna do? Have you got anyone you can go to?${prompt}
  8307: |-
    No, no one I can think of.
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 7[2]} are not that easy to get ahold of. My family's gonna be begging in the alley at this rate.${prompt}

    Help him out?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure, why not.
    I only work for cold, hard gil.${prompt}
  8310: |-
    Really?
    Well, I won't hold my breath. There aren't too many adventurers who work for nothing these days.${prompt}
  8311: |-
    Can't say I'm surprised.
    Haven't met many adventurers who work for free.${prompt}
  8312: 'Well, I''m not gonna hold my breath waiting for that ${item-singular: 7[2]}. There aren''t too many adventurers who work for nothing these days.${prompt}'
  8313: Meeting your quota is an iron rule of the Brugaire Consortium. I've seen more than a few prospective merchants shown the door after failing to observe it. The business world is an unforgiving place.${prompt}
  8314: You're gonna let me have this? I didn't think adventurers like you still existed. The boss would do well to take a lesson in compassion from you...${prompt}
  8315: What do I need to be learning a lesson in?${prompt}
  8316: |-
    Ah, Boss!
    I, uh, I was just talking about changing my baby's diapers, and thought that you might need to learn someday, in case you were thinking of having children...${prompt}
  8317: |-
    ...I think I'll pass on that.
    Diapers aside, have you met your quota yet?${prompt}
  8318: H-here you go, Boss.${prompt}
  8319: |-
    Hmm, this'll do, I suppose.
    Keep to your deadline next time.${prompt}
  8320: Yes, sir!${prompt}
  8321: Boss!${prompt}
  8322: What is it? Did you get caught smuggling again?${prompt}
  8323: I came to inform you that your father has just passed away. Funeral arrangements need to be made...${prompt}
  8324: I see...${prompt}
  8325: Boss, I'm sorry for your loss...${prompt}
  8326: |-
    Loss? Who's lost anything?
    My father was just a foolish old man. I wanted to do anything but follow in his footsteps.${prompt}
  8327: He would be at work from sunrise to sunset, so I never had what you could call a “conversation” with him. And despite the hours he spent at his trade, we never had any money. I was always out making deliveries for pocket change.${prompt}
  8328: I haven't seen the old man for years now, but I suppose I must give him a funeral for decency's sake.${prompt}
  8329: The boss has never talked about his family before... It's kinda surprising that he even has a father in the first place.${prompt}
  8330: I hope my child will be sad when I leave this world... Dammit, I'm starting to tear up. Gotta get back to work.${prompt}
  8331: I'm glad the boss hasn't been hit too hard by the loss of his father, but you know...${prompt}
  8332: He has my sympathies.${prompt}
  8333: Ouch, that still stings...${prompt}
  8334: Boss, what happened to you?${prompt}
  8335: After the funeral, I left with my father's inheritance, and then some scoundrel clouted me from behind. When I woke up, a young lady was binding my wound, and my inheritance was gone.${prompt}
  8336: |-
    Are you sure you're all right?
    And your inheritance, what of that...${prompt}
  8337: It was just some old armor that wasn't of any real value to me.${prompt}
  8338: But there was this rich merchant who was interested in buying it for a high price. I hate to see a source of revenue get away from me like that.${prompt}
  8339: This kind of criminal is more than the merchants can deal with. We need an adventurer who's no stranger to battle. Your reward will be twenty percent of the selling price of the armor. Come back here when you have it.${prompt}
  8340: |-
    The boss doesn't take no for an answer. Actually, he usually doesn't give you a chance to answer...
    But for this job, you can't help but take his side in the matter.${prompt}
  8341: The cad that mugged our boss must have been following him the whole time. There must be someone who saw what happened.${prompt}
  8342: 'The girl who tended to the boss after his attack picked up that ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}? Hmm, I guess it could have belonged to his attacker...${prompt}'
  8343: That kind of jewelry isn't worth much without the matching earring. It looks to be of reasonably high quality, and would bring in a nice profit if you could get the Goldsmith's Guild to recreate its partner.${prompt}
  8344: The person who attacked our boss must have lost their desire to live. As soon as you find out who it is, the boss is gonna beat them to a pulp! ${prompt}
  8345: |-
    You got it back?
    Good work! Let's go tell the boss.${prompt}
  8346: This is it. You have my thanks, adventurer.${prompt}
  8347: My father was hired to repair this armor, but the customer never showed to collect it after it was fixed. Not knowing what else to do, he just decided to hold on to it.${prompt}
  8348: Apparently there were quite a few potential buyers, but my father made excuses not to part with it.${prompt}
  8349: Well, if someone wants to buy this armor, then that's fine by me. Get it off my hands and fill my pockets at the same time!${prompt}
  8350: Brugaire, the weapons you delivered to the knights contained many blades of poor quality. Surely you inspected your goods before sending them off?${prompt}
  8351: "What? Yeah, of course I did. \nIf you have a problem with the quality, we can always take them back. I don't think you'll find another distributor who deals in that kind of quantity, though.${prompt}"
  8352: |-
    ...You would take advantage of us? Have you no pride in your work...?
    You are nothing like your father was.${prompt}
  8353: You knew my father?${prompt}
  8354: I cannot count the number of knights who owe their lives to the sturdy armor crafted by that man. We have lost a truly talented and valued individual. You have my deepest sympathies.${prompt}
  8355: '...I never knew about that.${prompt}'
  8356: "In honor of your father, I will let this matter of shoddy weapons pass. \nHowever, I should tell you I have heard rumors that the Tenshodo are considering expanding their business into San d'Oria.\n...I bid you good day, Brugaire.${prompt}"
  8357: |-
    That haughty sonofa...
    He sounds just like my father.${prompt}
  8358: '...Hmph. Pride, huh.${prompt}'
  8359: Ah, Felippe will be here soon.${prompt}
  8360: Brugaire, you have the item we discussed?${prompt}
  8361: Yeah, I got it...${prompt}
  8362: |-
    Well then, let us be down to business.
    This piece will be the pride of my collection.${prompt}
  8363: |-
    What's the matter? Having troubles with the authorities again?
    Fear not! I can help clear up any “misunderstandings.”${prompt}
  8364: '...Felippe, I hate to do this to you, but can we just forget about this whole deal?${prompt}'
  8365: "...? \nIf my offer is too low, I'm open to negotiation.${prompt}"
  8366: |-
    No, it's not that.
    It's a problem of conscience.
    I'll pay you a fee for breaking our deal, so just let it go, okay?${prompt}
  8367: |-
    It's a bit late for that!
    I've already bragged to all my friends about my new acquisition. You'll make me a laughingstock!${prompt}
  8368: I realize this goes against all our rules, but I'm not gonna back down on this. Please understand, Felippe.${prompt}
  8369: |-
    Hmph! You were the one who brought this deal to me in the first place. I don't appreciate being toyed with, Brugaire...
    Don't come crying to me when you can't find another buyer!${prompt}
  8370: Boss, are you all right?${prompt}
  8371: |-
    I... This has nothing to do with what that walking tin can said about my father.
    Just holding on to this thing reminds me of my old man and the things he used to lecture me about... It makes my teeth grind.${prompt}
  8372: |-
    Here, you can have this.
    You're the one who brought it back here, after all.${prompt}
  8373: |-
    Your father's inheritance...
    Boss, are you sure?${prompt}
  8374: |-
    If I say I'm sure, then I'm sure, all right!
    It seems I've gotten something more valuable in its place...${prompt}
  8375: My father used to say to me, “The pride that a craftsman takes in his work is reflected in the quality of his wares.”${prompt}
  8376: I've never really thought about what that meant before...${prompt}
  8377: Boss, where are you going?${prompt}
  8378: |-
    I'm just gonna go pay my respects to my father.
    Tell him that maybe his way of living wasn't so bad after all...${prompt}
  8379: Our boss is really a nice guy, but he's just a little awkward in expressing himself. It's that quality that makes me wanna keep working for him.${prompt}
  8380: I might send my mother something nice for the holidays. We've all but disowned each other, so it makes it difficult for me to just drop in.${prompt}
  8381: The boss has a question for you. Wait here a moment.${prompt}
  8382: |-
    There's something I forgot to ask.
    Who the hell was the rogue that stole my father's inheritance?${prompt}
  8383: "What, you can't tell me the name? \nAnd there's someone who's pulling this thief's strings?\nHmmm...things just got interesting. I'd really like to catch whoever it is and break a few of their teeth.${prompt}"
  8384: |-
    This guy must be after the relics of the last dragoon...
    If we can find the armor before him, maybe we can use it to lure him out into the open.${prompt}
  8385: If you say you can't tell me the name of the thief, I'm sure you got your reasons. I'm not interested in sparring with a small fry, in any case. Instead, there's something I want you to procure for me.${prompt}
  8386: "I want you to find the helm of the last dragoon, hidden somewhere within the Kuftal Tunnel. I've wanted to get my hands on it for some time now, and an adventurer like yourself is perfect for the job. \nWell, don't just stand there!${prompt}"
  8387: You've got nerve, keeping secrets from the boss... I think you'd be better off finding that treasure chest in the Kuftal Tunnel and getting back here as soon as possible!${prompt}
  8388: "Huh, the chest was empty!?\nAll you found was some letter of defiance...? \nWhen the boss finds out, he's gonna hit the roof! He hates to be made a fool of...${prompt}"
  8389: |-
    I went down to the jail to beat the hell out of that Ancolain for making a fool out of me, but started to feel kinda ridiculous.
    ...He's suffering plenty already.${prompt}
  8390: |-
    I heard it all from Rahal.
    He told me things got pretty tense out there.
    But it's those kinds of situations that make life interesting, don't you think?${prompt}
  8391: I've been thinking about what my work means to me, and truth to tell, I couldn't really say. What I can say, though, is that this business gives me some exciting times.${prompt}
  8392: |-
    And isn't that enough?
    I might find out what it all means someday, and then again, I might not. But I never got into this business to soul-search, anyway.${prompt}
  8393: |-
    Enough of that kinda talk.
    You boys better be on target for your quotas for next week!
    Be seeing you soon.${prompt}
  8394: All this “last dragoon” business has tired me out, but at least it's never dull around here! Keeps me motivated, even if meeting my quota can be stressful sometimes.${prompt}
  8395: |-
    Urgh... I think I'm gonna struggle to get clear this week.
    But you'll be there to bail me out, right!?${prompt}
  8396: Wh-when will the airship from Tavnazia arrive!?${prompt}
  8397: I am sorry, but we have no records for the type of airship you described.${prompt}
  8398: Vessels not registered with the air travel agency are considered illegal, and are only permitted to dock here in emergency situations.${prompt}
  8399: |-
    Did you truly see an airship like that?
    Are you sure it wasn't a dream or hallucination?${prompt}
  8400: |-
    Are you still going on about that imaginary airship?
    I assure you, every single vessel is strictly monitored by the air travel agency.${prompt}
  8401: Even under the orders of the cathedral, no airship can be freely commandeered to fly off to any old place in Vana'diel--especially not the Tavnazian Marquisate!${prompt}
  8402: |-
    If you don't believe me, try asking at any of the other agencies.
    That is, if you don't mind having people doubt your sanity...${prompt}
  8403: |-
    Beans, beans, and more beans.
    If the world were not in this sorry state, my connections with the count would have me seated at a banquet table.${prompt}
  8404: |-
    Will not Uncle Louverance restore the Knights Mistalle to our former glory in the foreseeable future?
    An age has passed since he left on his journey to the north...${prompt}
  8405: |-
    What's this?
    You wish to hear more of my uncle?
    You have strange interests for an adventurer, friend.${prompt}
  8406: |-
    If you wish to learn more about my uncle, why not meet with him in person?
    He can be found somewhere beyond the Uleguerand Range, north of Xarcabard.${prompt}
  8407: |-
    The Orcish forces passed over the Uleguerand Range to stage their invasion into Quon.
    Several hundred years ago, during their efforts to halt the Orcs' advance through the mountains, the Royal Knights drew a map of the area.${prompt}
  8408: Access to this map is strictly controlled, and it cannot be freely borrowed.${prompt}
  8409: The cartography was based on intelligence gathered in the conflict with the Orcish Empire...${prompt}
  8410: '...and perusal of the map will reveal the Royal Knights'' battle tactics.${prompt}'
  8411: Due to the return of Lord Excenmille--and his report that the Orcish Empire's strength far exceeds our estimates--the map has been placed under even tighter security.${prompt}
  8412: In the case of my uncle, his problem was solved by the appearance of a man who offered to guide him across the mountains.${prompt}
  8413: According to that guide, the northern side of the Uleguerand Range can be reached through the tunnels that wind beneath Thousandfall Ridge.${prompt}
  8414: If you truly intend to meet with my uncle, tell him his nephew, Antreneau, worries for him and wishes for his swift return.${prompt}
  8415: If you wish to meet with my uncle, you must cross the Uleguerand Range.${prompt}
  8416: I am not permitted to give you a map of the area, however I will tell you the directions the guide gave my uncle.${prompt}
  8417: According to the guide, a cave found on the slopes of Thousandfall Ridge leads to the other side of the Uleguerand Range.${prompt}
  8418: You actually managed to find my uncle!?${prompt}
  8419: "So, he is well?\nHe travels a hard path, if what you say is true. \nI feel ashamed to be complaining of nothing more than a steady diet of beans.${prompt}"
  8420: |-
    But I cannot quell this desire for meat!
    Bring me meat! Any dish with meat in it will do!${prompt}

  8546: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  8547: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  8548: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  8549: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  8550: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  8551: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  8552: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  8553: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  8554: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  8555: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  8556: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  8557: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  8558: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  8559: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  8560: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  8561: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  8562: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  8563: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  8564: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  8565: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  8566: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  8567: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  8568: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'
  8569: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt}
  8570: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  8571: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  8572: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}

    Festival time, kupo～!!!
    We moogles have come up with a new game for you to enjoy called "Azimuth Circle"!${prompt}
  8620: |-
    Azimuth Circle is played in pairs!
    First, find a partner and make a party, kupo!${prompt}
  8621: After you've done that, try to find a certain checkpoint located in this town! There are many checkpoints, but only one right answer, kupo!${prompt}
  8622: However...you can only check three points, kupo! But don't worry--once you've checked a point, you can look at it again any number of times!${prompt}
  8623: At each location lies a compass that points in the direction of your partner's special checkpoint! The directions will be indicated from the viewpoint of your partner, kupo～.${prompt}
  8624: Find both of your special checkpoints and exchange the items you receive from them! Bring those items to us. We will give you a reward in exchange, kupo!${prompt}
  8625: |-
    That's all there is to it, kupo!
    To participate, make a party of two and talk to a moogle!${prompt}
  8626: |-
    That's all there is to it, kupo!
    Your partner seems to already be participating in the game.
    If you want to play together, ask your partner to cancel the current game and talk to a moogle again!${prompt}
  8627: Will you participate in Azimuth Circle with your partner, kupo?${prompt}
  8628: |-
    Play the game?
    ${selection-lines}
    Ready to go!
    I'll pass.${prompt}
  8629: When both of you are ready, talk to a moogle! Then the game will begin, kupo!${prompt}
  8630: If you decide you want to play, just come with a friend, kupo!${prompt}
  8631: Our records indicate that you are presently signed up for Azimuth Circle somewhere else, kupo. Would you like to cancel your participation there?${prompt}
  8632: |-
    Well, kupo?
    You want to stop playing Azimuth Circle?${prompt}

    Cancel participation in Azimuth Circle?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, freedom!
    I'll keep playing, thanks.${prompt}

    Your game has been cancelled.
    If you want to try again, speak to a moogle, kupo!${prompt}

  8636: This isn't the item your partner found! We're still waiting on the item you got from your friend, kupo!${prompt}
  8637: |-
    You must wait for your partner to finish, kupo!
    Would you like to cancel the current game instead?${prompt}

  8644: |-
    I must say, things are rather lively in town today.
    Do you not agree, Regine?${prompt}
  8645: With all the people coming in and out, I find myself hoping some rich red mage without a spell to her name might wander in and purchase our entire stock...${prompt}
  8646: Just when you think a customer has finally appeared, they flash that silly badge and begin prattling about the “Empire of Aht Urhgan.” As if we would know anything about such an exotic country.${prompt}
  8647: |-
    Who would dream that either of us had even traveled beyond the borders of San d'Oria?
    Do they believe we are like the Tavnazians of old and maintain trading partners in the Near East?${prompt}
  8648: |-
    I hear the town of Al Zahbi, a strategic location in the west of Aht Urhgan, often finds itself surrounded by invading beastman forces...
    What feeble defenses they must have in the Near East.${prompt}
  8649: |-
    This is what comes of a nation that does not embrace the path of chivalry.
    Our heroic knights would make short work of any beastman horde, no matter their number!
    Long live King Destin!${prompt}
  8650: |-
    Hmph, thinking of becoming a mercenary, are you?
    Let me give you some advice: The beastmen of the Near East are far more savage than the fiends of Ronfaure.${prompt}
  8651: I would avoid those lands until I was sure of my strength. They care not who they kill--in that respect, they are much like the Orcs.${prompt}
  8652: |-
    In war, survival is key.
    Picking your battles is also a valid strategy.${prompt}
  8653: That's called “Knowing your enemy,” that is!${prompt}
  8654: |-
    Yeah!
    “Knowing your anemone!”${prompt}
  8655: I hear frightful tales from the Near East. They say that the beastmen are leading armies into the lands of people.${prompt}
  8656: |-
    That badge...
    It is as if the terrible events of twenty years past have returned to haunt us...${prompt}
  8657: |-
    Yes, the nation they speak of lies far away, yet I feel the seed of fear blossom in my heart.
    War is like a raging fire that leaps from country to country, consuming all in its path...${prompt}
  8658: I wonder what culinary delights grace the tables of the Near East.${prompt}
  8659: |-
    The rice dish “pilaf” is rumored to be delicious.
    All those exotic spices...${prompt}
  8660: |-
    <Rumble...>
    Oh! It seems I have awoken the beast of my appetite with all these gastronomic musings!${prompt}
  8661: Hm...${prompt}
  8662: I do not remember ever seeing you before. What do you need of me?${prompt}
  8663: |-
    Show him Leleroon's letter?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    Not now.${prompt}
  8664: Well now, what have we here? I have not seen Leleroon in a long time. I wonder how the little Qiqirn is doing...${prompt}
  8665: You are a member of the Seagull Phratrie, correct? Sorry for my curt words earlier.${prompt}
  8666: I was a member of the Black Cradle's crew until that giant hole was blown into its hull... Then I ventured here to San d'Oria.${prompt}
  8667: As the oldest member, all the battles were starting to take their toll on me. So when the ship sank, I took the opportunity to retire.${prompt}
  8668: You came here in order to get some quality corsair armor, did you?${prompt}
  8669: 'Well then, you have come to the right place. I can make ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} for you.${prompt}'
  8670: However, first I must test your skill as a corsair and determine that you are up to my standard. Until now, I have created equipment for Qultada only.${prompt}
  8671: You have met Qultada, have you not?${prompt}
  8672: When I decided to abandon life at sea, the fool tried desperately to stop me.${prompt}
  8673: Anyway, that is all in the past.${prompt}
  8674: 'Bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}...${prompt}'
  8675: I cannot do anything until you bring me the materials first.${prompt}
  8676: Come back after you manage to find them.${prompt}
  8677: Ah, I see you've managed to find all the materials. Good work.${prompt}
  8678: All you have to do now is pay the costs of production.${prompt}
  8679: 'That will be ${number: 5} ${item-given-plurality: 5[2], 4[2]}...${prompt}'
  8680: I am not going anywhere. Just bring the materials whenever you want.${prompt}
  8681: Well, this is an unexpected development...${prompt}
  8682: I guess I will have to actually make your equipment, then! Please wait a while until I can finish.${prompt}
  8683: Patience, now, patience. Hasty work makes sloppy work.${prompt}
  8684: The way of the corsair means being able to show the world an easygoing smile in the most anxious of times.${prompt}
  8685: So relax and wait just a bit longer.${prompt}
  8686: 'Here you go... A genuine ${item-singular: 6[2]}, all for you.${prompt}'
  8687: Ah, the corsairs... Those were the days...${prompt}
  8688: Qultada and I had many a disagreement on that ship. I used to have more of a temper.${prompt}
  8689: I thought we should stop hounding the Empire.${prompt}
  8690: I often disagreed with his methods, and eventually left the Phratrie because of it.${prompt}
  8691: Now that I am here on land, though, I am starting to understand his ideas, too. I have had a lot to think about...${prompt}
  8692: It seems to me that a captain is a lot like the sea breeze...${prompt}
  8693: Leading a storm of a crew... Pressing ever forward over the seas...${prompt}
  8694: You know Qultada, so you must know what I mean.${prompt}
  8695: That man can be like a hurricane...${prompt}
  8696: When you came to visit me the other day, I felt the same qualities in you.${prompt}
  8697: Such memories make me long to return to life on the endless waves...${prompt}
  8698: Please give everyone my blessings.${prompt}
  8699: I can no longer sail, but I have no doubt that you and your companions will shape a new path for the corsairs.${prompt}
  8700: 'Are you properly caring for your ${item-singular: 0[2]}? Whenever you have the time, please tell me how things are going on the Aradjiah continent.${prompt}'
  8701: I have been long separated from Aradjiah, but the smell of the sea is the same across Urhguum.${prompt}
  8702: Whenever I close my eyes, my homeland spreads out before me as vividly as ever.${prompt}
  8703: |-

    Satisfaction.

  8927: “Strength” is a term used to describe the chocobo's leg power. The more strength a chocobo has, the faster it will be able to run. Rental chocobos have been raised with an emphasis on this attribute.${prompt}
  8928: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  8929: “Endurance” is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.${prompt}
  8930: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  8931: “Discernment” is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.${prompt}
  8932: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  8933: “Receptivity” is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.${prompt}
  8934: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  8935: “Energy” is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.${prompt}
  8936: You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!${prompt}
  8937: “Affection” is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!${prompt}
  8938: You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.${prompt}
  8939: 'If you really want to raise your chocobo''s affection quickly, you can give it ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, but I can''t recommend doing so unless absolutely necessary.${prompt}'
  8940: “Satisfaction” is a term used to describe how full or hungry your chocobo is. If your chocobo is full, it will gain a lot of energy before the next day.${prompt}

  8943: A care schedule is a series of plans that you set up for your chocobo so that we can take care of it while you are away.${prompt}
  8944: How you want us to care for your chocobo each day is completely up to you.${prompt}
  8945: You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).${prompt}
  8946: When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.${prompt}
  8947: With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.${prompt}
  8948: The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.${prompt}
  8949: You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.${prompt}
  8950: The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.${prompt}
  8951: However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.${prompt}
  8952: We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.${prompt}
  8953: Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.${prompt}
  8954: Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.${prompt}
  8955: If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  8956: Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.${prompt}
  8957: If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  8958: Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.${prompt}
  8959: However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.${prompt}
  8960: If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  8961: Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.${prompt}
  8962: But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.${prompt}
  8963: If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  8964: You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  8965: The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.${prompt}
  8966: You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.${prompt}
  8967: The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.${prompt}
  8968: You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  8969: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  8970: You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.${prompt}

  8976: In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  8977: Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.${prompt}
  8978: On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.${prompt}
  8979: However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.${prompt}
  8980: You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  8981: Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.${prompt}
  8982: You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.${prompt}
  8983: I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)${prompt}
  8984: Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.${prompt}
  8985: This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.${prompt}
  8986: Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.${prompt}
  8987: You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.${prompt}
  8988: I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.${prompt}
  8989: Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!${prompt}

    ${selection-lines}
    Why feeding is important.
    Vegetables.
    Wildgrasses.
    Carrots.
    Worms.
    Medicines.
    Pastes.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  8991: Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.${prompt}
  8992: However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.${prompt}
  8993: The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.${prompt}
  8994: At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!${prompt}
  8995: Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.${prompt}
  8996: There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!${prompt}
  8997: 'Just ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.${prompt}'
  8998: 'This is the standard variety of chocobo feed, among which ${item-plural: 0[2]} are most popular.${prompt}'
  8999: 'Chocobos also seem to enjoy ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  9000: These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.${prompt}
  9001: Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.${prompt}
  9002: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, the effects are different.${prompt}'
  9003: 'In addition, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is effective for illness, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for a stomachache. It''s a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.${prompt}'
  9004: Carrots are high in nutrition, and will have an effect on the chocobo's strength and discernment.${prompt}
  9005: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}, for example, affect the chocobo''s physical attributes, and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are good for its mental attributes. ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 2[2]} are in a category of their own.${prompt}'
  9006: Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  9007: Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!${prompt}
  9008: 'For example, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will dramatically increase your chocobo''s affection, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will restore its energy.${prompt}'
  9009: But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...${prompt}
  9010: 'The most curious of all the worms is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...${prompt}'
  9011: Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  9012: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will restore your chocobo''s energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.${prompt}'
  9013: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.${prompt}'
  9014: A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.${prompt}
  9015: Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.${prompt}
  9016: You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.${prompt}
  9017: Chicks can also eat regular feed, though.${prompt}

    Which would you like to ask about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Abilities.
    Temperament.
    Weather preferences.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  9019: Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.${prompt}
  9020: For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.${prompt}
  9021: Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.${prompt}
  9022: But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.${prompt}
  9023: The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.${prompt}
  9024: Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.${prompt}
  9025: Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.${prompt}
  9026: Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.${prompt}
  9027: You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.${prompt}
  9028: After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.${prompt}
  9029: 'When your chocobo retires, you will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Be sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  9030: 'You can use the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  9031: The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!${prompt}
  9032: When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.${prompt}
  9033: 'You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}'
  9034: 'You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  9035: I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.${prompt}
  9036: 'When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  9037: You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  9038: That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.${prompt}
  9039: 'When you want to register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field, trade ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  9040: 'Also, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}''s power will grow weak after you''ve used it several times.${prompt}'

  9046: 'You can use ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to call your chocobo in the field to use as a mount.${prompt}'
  9047: The more you use it, the weaker it will get, so eventually you will need to exchange it to a VCS member for a new one.${prompt}
  9048: 'Only people who have been approved by the VCS President can get ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, so good luck with that...${prompt}'

    Return.${prompt}
  10173: |-
    Why not!?
    Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.${prompt}
  10174: We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A “win-win situation,” as we like to call it in the business.${prompt}
  10175: However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...${prompt}
  10176: The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.${prompt}
  10177: And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.${prompt}
  10178: Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!${prompt}
  10179: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  10180: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  10181: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  10182: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  10183: Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.${prompt}
  10184: Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.${prompt}
  10185: In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.${prompt}
  10186: Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.${prompt}
  10187: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  10188: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  10189: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  10190: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  10191: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  10192: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  10193: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  10194: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  10195: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.${prompt}'
  10196: You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)${prompt}
  10197: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  10198: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  10199: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  10200: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  10201: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  10202: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
  10203: 'Ah, it says here that you are a member of the ${choice: 0}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.${prompt}'
  10204: Have you come today to change your affiliation?${prompt}
  10205: 'Remember, you will not be able to use any chocobucks earned in ${choice: 0}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst] here, and you will also lose any Solo Victory Points that you may have. Are you sure you want to go through with this?${prompt}'
  10206: |-

  10467: 'Attendants at the chocobet centers are there to assist you with acquiring ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, as well as collecting your winnings.${prompt}'
  10468: There are a total of five centers readily available for your convenience, each of which are located near the transportation portals. There are two to the east and west of here, and one just to the north.${prompt}

    Race Progression.
    That's about it.${prompt}
  10482: A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.${prompt}
  10483: Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.${prompt}
  10484: In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.${prompt}
  10485: For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.${prompt}
  10486: The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.${prompt}
  10487: What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.${prompt}
  10488: Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  10489: Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.${prompt}
  10490: The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.${prompt}
  10491: The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.${prompt}
  10492: The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.${prompt}
  10493: In such an event, the “less endowed” of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.${prompt}
  10494: Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.${prompt}
  10495: Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the “race grade.”${prompt}
  10496: For example, a “C4 Chocobo Race” would indicate a typical grade 4 race.${prompt}
  10497: We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.${prompt}
  10498: No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.${prompt}
  10499: Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.${prompt}
  10500: As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.${prompt}
  10501: Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  10502: Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.${prompt}
  10503: Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.${prompt}
  10504: The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.${prompt}
  10505: As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.${prompt}
  10506: Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  10507: We have a total of four races that run in succession.${prompt}
  10508: Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.${prompt}
  10509: Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.${prompt}
  10510: Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!${prompt}

    Signing up for another race.
    I'm fine, thanks.${prompt}
  10512: There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.${prompt}
  10513: First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.${prompt}
  10514: Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a “race chocobo,” for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.${prompt}
  10515: Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...${prompt}
  10516: All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.${prompt}
  10517: A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.${prompt}
  10518: Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.${prompt}
  10519: There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.${prompt}
  10520: There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.${prompt}
  10521: 'Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.${prompt}'
  10522: 'In the event that you should lose or misplace your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.${prompt}'
  10523: The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!${prompt}
  10524: You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.${prompt}
  10525: 'To collect, simply hand in the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you received during race signup at any signup center.${prompt}'
  10526: The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.${prompt}
  10527: You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.${prompt}
  10528: After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).${prompt}
  10529: This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.${prompt}
  10530: We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.${prompt}

    What would you like to ask?
    ${selection-lines}
    What is chocobetting?
    How do I bet?
    What are odds?
    When do I bet?
    How do I collect winnings?
    Nothing.${prompt}
  10532: Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.${prompt}
  10533: To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.${prompt}
  10534: Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.${prompt}
  10535: For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.${prompt}
  10536: And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.${prompt}
  10537: Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.${prompt}
  10538: The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!${prompt}
  10539: 'To place a chocobet, you must obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the chocobet center. ${prompt}'
  10540: 'For any single ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.${prompt}'
  10541: We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.${prompt}
  10542: Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.${prompt}
  10543: Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.${prompt}
  10544: It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.${prompt}
  10545: What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.${prompt}
  10546: 'Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.${prompt}'
  10547: The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.${prompt}
  10548: Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.${prompt}
  10549: Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.${prompt}
  10550: Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.${prompt}
  10551: 'Once the race is finished, you can exchange your ${item-singular: 0[2]} at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.${prompt}'
  10552: 'Without ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  10553: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.${prompt}'
  10554: Should one week pass, we will be unable to accept the ticket, so it is always best to cash out as soon as possible.${prompt}

    Return.${prompt}
  10617: With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.${prompt}
  10618: As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!${prompt}
  10619: “The Monster Races”!${prompt}
  10620: Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing! ${prompt}
  10621: |-
    Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele.
    What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?${prompt}
  10622: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  10623: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  10624: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  10625: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  10626: Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!${prompt}
  10627: |-
    The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal.
    It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.${prompt}
  10628: |-
    Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern.
    If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.${prompt}
  10629: |-
    Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area.
    Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.${prompt}
  10630: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  10631: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  10632: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  10633: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  10634: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  10635: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  10636: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  10637: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  10638: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo''s performance.${prompt}'
  10639: |-
    You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers.
    Thank you for your understanding.${prompt}
  10640: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  10641: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  10642: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  10643: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  10644: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  10645: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
  10646: Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.${prompt}
  10647: |-
    We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence.
    The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.${prompt}
  10648: |-
    Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits.
    And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.${prompt}
  10649: |-
    As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind.
    It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack.
    Consider yourself warned.${prompt}
  10650: |-
    In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well.
    Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part.
    It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!${prompt}
  10651: |-
    Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed.
    These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.${prompt}

  10719: 'First we have ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}, who will be ridden by ${choice: 1}[the ace of the chase, Ignazio/three-time chocobo racing all★star, Eudocia/the bloody emperor, Roinolier/the empress of speed, Maurette/Lami-Baami Suave Esquire III/the red rose of racing, Sosopapa/CRA legend, Khowa Mathgalhi/rising CRA star, Bayansh].${prompt}'
  10720: ピヨピヨ！${prompt}
  10721: She says, “When the ace makes chase, there's not a bird in Vana'diel who can keep pace.”${prompt}
  10722: She says, “And you can bet the chocobo farm that this year it'll be 'four-time' all☆star!“${prompt}
  10723: She says, “This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean.”${prompt}
  10724: She says, “There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed.”${prompt}
  10725: She says, “This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say.”${prompt}
  10726: She says, “Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn.”${prompt}
  10727: She says, “This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race.”${prompt}
  10728: She says, ”This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'”${prompt}
  10729: 'Next we have ${choice: 0}[Pure Beauty/Ambitious Impact/Young Typhoon], being ridden by ${choice: 0}[the chocogirl next door, Hazina/dark chocostalker, Pikanza/self-proclaimed chocogeek, Qunbubu].${prompt}'
  10730: Sakura says, “Don't be fooled by the innocent smile--this girl will rip your chocobo's gizzard out and eat it for a late breakfast or early lunch!”${prompt}
  10731: Sakura says, “This Galka's unrelenting love for all things chocobo makes him a dangerous opponent on the track.”${prompt}
  10732: Sakura says, “Thousands of hours of chocoresearch have sharpened the mind of this jolly jockey into a pointy stick, ready to poke and prod anyone who dares stand in her way.”${prompt}
  10733: 'Our next chocobo is ${choice: 0}[Shining Lady/Moon Night/Jet Fire], ridden by ${choice: 0}[Chanaille, a.k.a. Dances With Chocobos/the chocowhisperer, Sah Zhaowam/Sakura''s number one fan, Chamu-Pashamu].${prompt}'
  10734: Sakura says, “Ain't no one knows a chocobo's heart like this here lil' lady.”${prompt}
  10735: Sakura says, ”She has a good grasp of our vocabulary, but her pronunciation, especially her gutturals and fricatives, need a little work.”${prompt}
  10736: ピヨ～♪${prompt}
  10737: Sakura says she knows who she'll be rooting for this race...${prompt}
  10738: 'The next contestant is ${choice: 0}[Invincible Ace/Gold Queen/Million Spirit], jockeyed by ${choice: 0}[chocobo reincarnate, Vieuballideme/hyper breeder, Graciela/20-year racing veteran, Mayza-Hapurza].${prompt}'
  10739: She says that simply smelling like a chocobo doesn't make one a chocobo.${prompt}
  10740: She says that breeding chocobos is like stocking a warehouse with 10,000 opo-opos and 10,000 typewriters--you are bound to stumble across a masterpiece sooner or later.${prompt}
  10741: She says that this Tarutaru has been practicing the choquestrian arts since he was only two years old.${prompt}
  10742: And that's our lineup. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a feeling that today's match up will go down in the annals of racing history.${prompt}
  10743: And here's today's lineup. What excitement lies in store for all our faithful chocofans listening on the CRA linkshell channel?${prompt}
  10744: The contestants have arrived at the starting line, and the race will begin shortly.${prompt}
  10745: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to another round of awe-inspiring head-to-head chocobo racing! I am Goccilo, your master of ceremonies.
  10746: And joining us today are the commentating duo which require no introduction, the equally adroit and adorable Sakura...
  10747: '...and her obedient interpreter, everyone''s favorite lover of animals, Markovich!'
  10748: Good day, fol--
  10749: ピヨ！
  10750: 'Sakura would like to take this opportunity to speak out against fowl abuse across Vana''diel. '
  10751: And on that note, here come our eight avian racers now!
  10752: |-
    #${number: 4}: ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}
    #${number: 5}: ${unknown: 0x01058482818080}

    #${number: 7}: ${unknown: 0x01058482838080}
  10753: And there's your lineup, folks! It looks like we're going to have a real doozy on our hands here today!
  10754: Well, let's get right down to it! The race is about to begin!
  10755: I must admit, I was a tad vexed about who our bird might be facing today, but I realize now that my petty presentiments were quite unfounded.${prompt}
  10756: Yeah! What he said! You're lucky we're even letting you share the same track as Best!${prompt}
  10757: |-
    Yeah...
    Good luck, ${name-player}...${prompt}
  10758: Today's match is a head-to-head battle, with the winner taking all! Let's start off by introducing our two competitors.${prompt}
  10759: 'And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, ${choice: 0}[Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].${prompt}'
  10760: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'”${prompt}
  10761: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.”${prompt}
  10762: Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.${prompt}
  10763: They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.${prompt}
  10764: Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], Wahboud!${prompt}
  10765: Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!${prompt}
  10766: As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.${prompt}
  10767: ${name-player}. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.${prompt}
  10768: Good luck, ${name-player}. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!${prompt}
  10769: Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!${prompt}
  10770: 'And next we have ${choice: 0}[Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by ${choice: 0}[VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].${prompt}'
  10771: ピヨッ！${prompt}
  10772: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.”${prompt}
  10773: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.”${prompt}
  10774: Sakura says, “Big things often come in small packages.”${prompt}
  10775: Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--${prompt}
  10776: a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!${prompt}
  10777: This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.${prompt}
  10778: Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!${prompt}
  10779: It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted “piece de resistance”?${prompt}
  10780: We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.${prompt}
  10781: Well, there you have it.${prompt}
  10782: Now let's take a look at today's participants...${prompt}
  10783: |-
    Ladies and gentlemen!
    President of the Bastokan Republic, Hrichter Karst, proudly presents...${prompt}
  10784: '...the most prestigious chocobo race in all of southern Quon--the Gustaberg Derby!${prompt}'
  10785: Joining me today is Metalworks mastermind, Cid.${prompt}
  10786: Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?${prompt}
  10787: Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  10788: Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--${prompt}
  10789: The Rakapopo Cup!${prompt}
  10790: Today's guest is Heavens Tower's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Ku～pipi～!${prompt}
  10791: So～,♪ I've lea～rned that yo～u have entered♪ your ve～ry own pe～rsona～l♪ cho～cobo in the cu～p.♪ Wha～t do yo～u think her♪ cha～nces are of ta～king♪ ho～me the gra～nd pri～ze?♪${prompt}
  10792: Are yo～u making fun of me, si～r!? We～ll, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my～ gutty-wutty when my Starlight sai～ls across the finish line yea～rs before the nearest competitaru!♪${prompt}
  10793: Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.${prompt}
  10794: My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!${prompt}
  10795: '${choice: 0}[Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing all★star/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Ne～ver heard of ${choice: 0}[him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!${prompt}'
  10796: We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one “Kamp Kweh.” We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.${prompt}
  10797: Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...${prompt}
  10798: Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take mo～re than an embiggened brainy-wa～iny to beat Starlight!♪${prompt}
  10799: What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.${prompt}
  10800: Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...${prompt}
  10801: Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fa～n! I won't let Starlight lo～se to some impo～ster!${prompt}
  10802: Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called “reincarnate's” redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!${prompt}
  10803: Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?${prompt}
  10804: Hah! Well, I～ have been riding cho～cobos for twenty-one years!${prompt}
  10805: 'And next is ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by ${choice: 1}[San d''Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d''Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!${prompt}'
  10806: Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.${prompt}
  10807: Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...${prompt}
  10808: Both Starlight a～nd the professor hate to take orders... Maybe tha～t's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!♪${prompt}
  10809: The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.${prompt}
  10810: When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.${prompt}
  10811: When the profe～ssor's not stumbling over his spee～ch impediment-ethy, he's re～searching the intricacies of chocobo beha～vioral patterns.${prompt}
  10812: And they're off!
  10813: Markovich, what did you think of the start?
  10814: Well, I fel--
  10815: ピヨピヨッ！
  10816: Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.
  10817: Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  10818: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  10819: And as they pass the halfway mark...
  10820: '#${number: 1} ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} holds on to the lead!'
  10821: '${number: 0} different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!'
  10822: 'While from behind the pack, #${number: 1} ${unknown: 0x01058482838080} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  10823: 'While from behind, #${number: 2} ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  10824: 'All ${number: 0} chocobos battle for the lead!'
  10825: Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!
  10826: And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!
  10827: ピヨピヨ！
  10828: Sakura says, “The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.”
  10829: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  10830: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  10831: 'Incredible! ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}''s speed is approaching dangerous limits!'
  10832: 'It looks like ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!'
  10833: '${unknown: 0x01058482808080} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  10834: '${unknown: 0x01058482808080}''s speed has begun to drop off!'
  10835: 'It looks like ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} has begun to tire!'
  10836: The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  10837: The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  10838: The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!
  10839: The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!
  10840: 'The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}!?'
  10841: 'Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}!?'
  10842: 'And yet ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} seems completely unaffected by the attack!'
  10843: And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  10844: And now they're approaching the final corner!
  10845: '#${number: 1} ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  10846: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  10847: '#${number: 1} ${unknown: 0x01058482838080} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  10848: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead!'
  10849: The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  10850: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching #${number: 1} ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} today!'
  10851: 'And ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} takes the crown!'
  10852: 'What''s this? #${number: 1} ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} is making its move on the lead!'
  10853: 'And it''s ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} by a beak!!!'
  10854: Let's take a look at the results...${prompt}
  10855: '${number: 2}: ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} (#${number: 1})${prompt}'
  10856: There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!${prompt}
  10857: Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.${prompt}
  10858: Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.${prompt}
  10859: Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.${prompt}
  10860: |-
    What an amazing race!
    The other chocobos were no match for ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?${prompt}
  10861: 'What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird''s performance?${prompt}'
  10862: '${choice: 0}[Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!${prompt}'
  10863: The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.${prompt}
  10864: Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!${prompt}
  10865: Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...${prompt}
  10866: Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exa～ctly as I expected!♪${prompt}
  10867: The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no wa～y Starlight could lose! Her horoscope sai～d so!${prompt}
  10868: |-
    And there you have it.
    This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!${prompt}
  10869: And now, let's see the results from the last race.
  10870: '${number: 2}: ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} (#${number: 1})'
  10871: And that's all she wrote, folks!
  10872: 'The winnings for a ${number: 0}-${number: 1} bet come to ${number: 2} gil per quill!'
  10873: Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?
  10874: She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!
  10875: She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.
  10876: Until next time, race fans...
  10877: Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.${prompt}
  10878: 'Taking the crown for today''s race was none other than ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}!${prompt}'
  10879: 'To the winning steed''s owner we present the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Rocochookie,” I mean, “Chocorookie”!${prompt}'
  10880: 'And to the ambitious and sporting ${name-player}, we present this undeniably useful ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  10881: Good show, ${name-player}. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.${prompt}
  10882: |-
    Excellent race, ${name-player}!
    You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.${prompt}
  10883: Okay, ma～ybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I sti～ll think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!${prompt}
  10884: Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.${prompt}
  10885: But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.${prompt}

  10901: I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.${prompt}

    Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...${prompt}

  10906: |-
    But of course! I had forgotten all about it!
    Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you!
    Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!${prompt}
  10907: |-
    But that's not where it ends!
    There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?${prompt}
  10908: |-
    A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself.
    Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?${prompt}
  10909: It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.${prompt}
  10910: |-
    Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state!
    But...${prompt}
  10911: But...?${prompt}
  10912: I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.${prompt}
  10913: |-
    I see...
    Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?${prompt}
  10914: |-
    You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo.
    Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?${prompt}
  10915: |-
    But enough talking, I say.
    It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!${prompt}
  10916: |-
    Oh, yes, right...
    Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay!
    It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!${prompt}
  10917: 'In the chocobo corner, we have ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.${prompt}'
  10918: |-
    Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo?
    I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.${prompt}
  10919: '${unknown: 0x01058482808080}''s formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don''t let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, “a wolf in sheep''s clothing”!${prompt}'
  10920: I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!${prompt}
  10921: I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?${prompt}
  10922: Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that “monsters” like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.${prompt}
  10923: Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!${prompt}
  10924: With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!${prompt}
  10925: |-
    Whoopee!
    Bring them on, I say!${prompt}
  10926: |-
    Erm...yes...
    Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.${prompt}
  10927: Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.${prompt}
  10928: |-
    Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki!
    Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.${prompt}
  10929: |-
    Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo.
    I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.${prompt}
  10930: And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!${prompt}
  10931: |-
    My, oh my...!
    I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--${prompt}
  10932: |-
    A-ahem!
    I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.${prompt}
  10933: |-
    All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies!
    Well done, my pretty! Well done!${prompt}
  10934: |-
    It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders...
    <Sniffle>${prompt}
  10935: |-
    Next in the lineup is Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    ...!? What on Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  10936: |-
    Hrmmm...
    Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.${prompt}
  10937: Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...${prompt}
  10938: |-
    What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man!
    There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!${prompt}
  10939: Um, yes... Please forgive me...${prompt}
  10940: |-
    And won't you look at the lineup!
    This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks?
    I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?${prompt}
  10941: And with me today is our regular guest commentator...${prompt}
  10942: |-
    Huh?
    Why isn't Markovich here?${prompt}
  10943: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.${prompt}
  10944: |-
    <Gulp>
    You...you're that mage from Windurst...${prompt}
  10945: '...Professor Shantotto!${prompt}'
  10946: |-
    If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich,
    as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.${prompt}
  10947: |-
    Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence,
    four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.${prompt}
  10948: |-
    So if you care to hear out my little proposal,
    these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.${prompt}
  10949: |-
    With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice...
    Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?${prompt}
  10950: |-
    With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused?
    Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.${prompt}
  10951: First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.${prompt}
  10952: |-
    Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold.
    I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.${prompt}
  10953: Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.${prompt}
  10954: |-
    Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word “failure.”
    Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.${prompt}
  10955: Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.${prompt}
  10956: |-
    Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable.
    If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.${prompt}
  10957: Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!${prompt}
  10958: |-
    For Ace of Trophies, “championship contender” is an unfitting description.
    Even “consecutive champion” would not be too high an expectation.${prompt}
  10959: |-
    Um...Professor Shantotto...
    Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?${prompt}
  10960: |-
    Ohohohohoho!
    Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so.
    But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!${prompt}
  10961: |-
    Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage.
    Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.${prompt}
  10962: |-
    Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview.
    So let the race begin, without further ado!${prompt}
  10963: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    Of this inevitable result, I was always assured--
    that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!${prompt}
  10964: |-
    The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor.
    But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.${prompt}
  10965: |-
    H-hey!
    What do you think you're trying to pull here!?${prompt}
  10966: |-
    My, my, what a pleasant surprise!
    I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.${prompt}
  10967: |-
    How dare you “ohoho” your way into my hard-earned commentary seat!
    This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!${prompt}
  10968: |-
    Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification.
    I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.${prompt}
  10969: |-
    And you, Goccilo!
    What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!${prompt}
  10970: |-
    Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing!
    Until next time...!${prompt}
  10971: ${name-player}, I knew you'd make it all the way here.${prompt}
  10972: |-
    What's with the baffled expression?
    It's me, Sakura.${prompt}
  10973: |-
    You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird.
    I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.${prompt}
  10974: I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.${prompt}
  10975: I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...${prompt}
  10976: And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.${prompt}
  10977: I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.${prompt}
  10978: Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.${prompt}
  10979: I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  10980: I hope that'll be your chocobo, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  10981: |-
    And next, we have Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    But something seems to be different...
    Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.${prompt}
  10982: She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!${prompt}
  10983: The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.${prompt}
  10984: |-
    I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround!
    A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.${prompt}
  10985: And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.${prompt}
  10986: It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.${prompt}
  10987: |-
    And that completes the lineup, folks.
    With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!${prompt}
  10988: 'You find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10989: Welcome to the Dream Race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10990: I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.${prompt}
  10991: I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.${prompt}
  10992: I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.${prompt}
  10993: |-
    But no more...
    If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.${prompt}
  10994: This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.${prompt}
  10995: I won't hold back in today's race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10996: Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.${prompt}
  10997: Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  10998: I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?${prompt}
  10999: Next, we have Sakura...${prompt}
  11000: |-
    Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?
    This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!${prompt}
  11001: |-
    Well I'll be...
    In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!${prompt}
  11002: '...${prompt}'
  11003: |-
    Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks.
    For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?${prompt}
  11004: '${name-player}, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Chocochampion”!${prompt}'
  11005: |-
    Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far!
    Congratulations!${prompt}
  11006: |-
    Great race, ${name-player}.
    It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.${prompt}
  11007: |-
    But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come..
    With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...${prompt}
  11008: |-
    Princess...
    Princess Sakura!${prompt}
  11009: |-
    Princess...?
    What are you talking about? Who are you?${prompt}
  11010: |-
    Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion.
    I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.${prompt}
  11011: Searching for...me?${prompt}
  11012: |-
    Yes, Your Highness.
    You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.${prompt}
  11013: |-
    Are you serious!?
    Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?${prompt}
  11014: |-
    That is correct.
    Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.${prompt}
  11015: D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?${prompt}
  11016: |-
    ...!
    I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...${prompt}
  11017: Wh...what happened?${prompt}
  11018: |-
    You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world.
    You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...${prompt}
  11019: She...she gave up her life to save me?${prompt}
  11020: |-
    Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again.
    But, I never once gave up hope...${prompt}
  11021: My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.${prompt}
  11022: So that's what happened...${prompt}
  11023: Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos! ${prompt}
  11024: '...${prompt}'
  11025: I'm sorry, but I can't go.${prompt}
  11026: |-
    Your Highness!
    But...why!?${prompt}
  11027: Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like ${name-player}'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.${prompt}
  11028: What's more...${prompt}
  11029: I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...${prompt}
  11030: I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.${prompt}
  11031: What...?${prompt}
  11032: The only place I belong is here, beside you.${prompt}
  11033: |-
    And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer?
    I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?${prompt}
  11034: I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!${prompt}
  11035: |-
    Heehee!
    Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!${prompt}
  11036: |-
    ${name-player}, I'm looking forward to our rematch!
    Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?${prompt}
  11037: You're still here, eh, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  11038: Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?${prompt}
  11039: |-
    What?
    How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?${prompt}
  11040: |-
    Hohoho...
    It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.${prompt}
  11041: I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...${prompt}
  11042: |-
    Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos?
    No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.${prompt}
  11043: Sakura is the queen, you say?${prompt}
  11044: |-
    <Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises.
    But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.${prompt}
  11045: |-
    You know what they say: Home is where the heart is.
    To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.${prompt}
  11046: |-
    And you, our new Chocochampion!
    Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.${prompt}
  11047: |-
    Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today.
    These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.${prompt}
  11048: And they're off!
  11049: |-
    Hrmmm!
    ${choice: 0}[Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!
  11050: Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?
  11051: |-
    All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance.
    But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.
  11052: Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  11053: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  11054: '${unknown: 0x01058482808080} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  11055: The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  11056: The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!
  11057: And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  11058: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  11059: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead!'
  11060: The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  11061: 'What''s this!? ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} has used ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!'
  11062: '${unknown: 0x01058482808080} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  11063: '${unknown: 0x01058482808080} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  11064: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} today!'
  11065: 'What''s this? ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} is making its move on the lead!'
  11066: '${number: 1}: ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}${prompt}'
  11067: 'What''s this!? ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}''s using ${choice: 1}[Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!'
  11068: 'Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those ${choice: 0}[monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!'
  11069: |-
    ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed!
    And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!
  11070: "I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}'s step. \nAnd the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!"
  11071: |-
    And here's some unexpected drama, folks!
    The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?
  11072: 'Look at that! ${lettercase: 1}${unknown: 0x01058482808080}''s stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!'
  11073: |-
    Uh-oh, what's going on here!?
    The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!
  11074: 'Oooh! In a bold move, ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} has just used a ${choice: 0}[Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!'
  11075: |-
    What's this!?
    All of the chocobos other than ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!
  11076: |-
    Thanks to that brazen little act, ${unknown: 0x01058482808080} can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks!
    That just might seal the deal for ${unknown: 0x01058482808080}!
  11077: |-
    Never in all my days, race fans!
    In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!
  11078: |-
    How could my creation make such a rookie mistake?
    In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!
  11079: Shantotto starts casting Tornado!
  11080: The speed of the chocobos has dropped!
  11081: The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!
  11082: The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!
  11083: |-
    Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!?
    What in the world do you think you're doing!?
  11084: |-
    Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame.
    This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.
  11085: |-
    What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today?
    I've heard it being said that today's ${choice: 0}[creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal.
    This could get heavy, folks!
  11086: |-
    All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them.
    Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?
  11087: It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!
  11088: |-
    There's still plenty of race to go, race fans!
    More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!
  11089: And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!
  11090: |-
    The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now.
    This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!
  11091: |-
    This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent.
    Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!
  11092: |-
    And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty!
    Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!
  11093: |-
    And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them!
    But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?
  11094: |-
    I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call!
    Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?
  11095: |-
    It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now!

    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  11276: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.

  11277: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  11278: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  11279: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  11280: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  11281: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  11282: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  11283: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  11284: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  11285: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  11286: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  11287: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  11288: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  11289: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  11290: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  11291: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  11292: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  11293: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  11294: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  11295: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  11296: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  11297: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  11298: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  11299: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  11300: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  11301: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  11302: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  11303: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  11304: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  11305: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  11306: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  11307: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  11308: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  11309: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  11310: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  11311: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  11312: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  11313: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  11314: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  11315: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  11316: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  11317: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  11318: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  11319: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  11320: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  11321: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  11322: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  11323: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  11324: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  11325: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  11326: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  11327: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  11328: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  11329: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  11330: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  11331: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  11332: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  11333: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  11334: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  11335: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  11336: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  11337: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  11338: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  11339: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  11340: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  11341: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  11342: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  11343: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  11344: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  11345: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  11346: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  11347: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  11348: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  11349: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  11350: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  11351: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  11352: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  11353: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  11354: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?
    Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  11355: |-
    A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know.
    Let's see here...${prompt}

    That is all.
    Should you wish to have any other pieces of equipment analyzed, you know where to find us.${prompt}
  11362: |-
    Hmm...
    I'm afraid your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot house any more apertures.${prompt}
  11363: |-
    ...Alas.
    It's a shame, but it appears your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be etched.${prompt}
  11364: |-
    Hmm, what's this?
    It would seem that your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be etched at this time.${prompt}

    A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living.
    Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.${prompt}
  11374: |-
    I thought you'd never ask!
    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  11375: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  11376: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'
  11377: |-
    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  11378: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  11379: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  11380: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  11381: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  11382: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  11383: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}
  11384: |-
    That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.
    Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt}

  11481: She tore my fragile pride to shreds with her innocent words. In a fit of anger, I took leave of myself and chased the poor lass away.${prompt}
  11482: |-
    After she had fled, however, I mulled over her comments...and found naught but truth in them.
    It was exactly as she had said regarding the seasoning.${prompt}
  11483: In retrospect, many and more of my success stories--my better-loved dishes--owe their existence to her.${prompt}
  11484: She was undeserving of my anger. It shames me still to think of my unseemly behavior that day.${prompt}
  11485: Hrmmm... Come to think of it, there was another little girl even before then, one equally given to speaking her mind with regards to my cuisine.${prompt}
  11486: But age has taken its toll, I fear, and my memory is reluctant to divulge anything in full nowadays.${prompt}

  11548: |-
    I see, I see... Martello #0${number: 1}, you say?
    It sounds as if the operation was ${choice: 0}[a modest success./a reasonable success./a rousing success!/an unqualified success!]${prompt}
  11549: |-
    The resistance greatly values your contributions.
    Take this as a small token of our appreciation, and do not hesitate to return the next time you are willing to lend your support.${prompt}
  11550: |-
    I've been working with these here martellos since I was knee-high.
    Ask away, and my knowledge is yours.${prompt}
  11551: |-
    Ask something?
    ${selection-lines}
    So, what's a martello?
    Martello replenishment.
    Martello upgrades.
    Cautionary notes.
    Not now.${prompt}
  11552: |-
    The device we know as the martello was first developed by military engineers many years past, during an age of great war.
    Martellos serve to keep combatants fighting fit, healing their wounds and restoring their mental energies.${prompt}
  11553: You will observe that martellos have been constructed in numerous locales, so as to provide strategically located safe havens for harried resistance fighters. No doubt you will find yourself making use of them as well.${prompt}
  11554: In the bowels of each martello is contained a tank designed to hold martello fuel.${prompt}
  11555: |-
    This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is the lifeblood of the martello, and the source of its curative powers.
    Depleted stores will render the device little more than an oversized parchmentweight.${prompt}
  11556: That being the case, we're in continual need of volunteers willing to take on the vital task of replenishing these martellos.${prompt}
  11557: |-
    I have been charged with overseeing a supply of martello fuel.
    Should you be willing to take part in a replenishment run, you need only say the word.
    Needless to say, you will not go unrewarded for your efforts.${prompt}
  11558: |-
    Feast your eyes on this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. She's a beauty, isn't she?
    Installing one of these into a martello will increase its fuel capacity.${prompt}
  11559: |-
    An upgraded martello will be able to sustain its energy stores for a longer time between replenishment operations.
    Needless to say, this is a blessing and a half to those on the battlefield.${prompt}
  11560: |-
    Unfortunately, the installation procedure is quite complex.
    As such, we can only entrust it to experienced hands.${prompt}
  11561: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} are quite large and unwieldy.
    Even the burliest among us would be unable to carry one and ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} at the same time.${prompt}
  11562: Furthermore, these materials are quite unstable, and will rapidly corrode and be rendered useless if brought outside our immediate environs.${prompt}
  11563: '''Course, not that anyone could manage to travel that far, what with these fearsome landslides...${prompt}'
  11564: |-
    ${color-alt: 121}Warning:
    Changing areas, logging out, or becoming disconnected will cause all data pertinent to this quest to be reset.
  11565: 'Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has been lost.'
  11566: |-
    The resistance is currently suffering a materials shortage.
    Those wishing to participating in replenishment and upgrading operations should return at a later time.${prompt}
  11567: 'The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} breaks!'
  11568: 'Table: ${number: 0}'
  11569: |-
    Very well, friend.
    Should you ever find yourself in need of assistance, do not hesitate to return.${prompt}
  11570: |-
    Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo!
    Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?${prompt}
  11571: |-
    Do something, kupo?
    ${selection-lines}
    Porter service?
    Buy a storage slip.
    No, thank you.${prompt}
  11572: |-
    Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over?
    Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.${prompt}
  11573: |-
    That's where I come in, kupo.
    I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.${prompt}
  11574: 'To make use of my services, first you''ll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of ${number: 19} gil.${prompt}'
  11575: Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt}
  11576: You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt}
  11577: Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt}
  11578: |-
    Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.
    I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt}
  11579: |-
    Invisible to you, at least.
    It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt}
  11580: When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt}
  11581: |-
    I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.
    Simple as that, kupo!${prompt}
  11582: |-
    What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!
    Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt}
  11583: |-
    Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.
    So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt}
  11584: For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt}
  11585: |-
    Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!
    It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt}
  11586: Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt}
  11587: |-
    If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!
    No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”
    Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt}
  11588: Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt}
  11589: If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt}
  11590: |-
    And that's all there is to it.
    This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!${prompt}

  11850: Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.${prompt}
  11851: Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.${prompt}
  11852: “Unity” is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.${prompt}
  11853: Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.${prompt}
  11854: 'Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as “${keyitem-plural: 1[2]}.”${prompt}'
  11855: Chat settings may be changed by selecting “Status” from the main menu, and choosing “Unity Info” under the “Unity” submenu.${prompt}
  11856: You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.${prompt}
  11857: Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.${prompt}
  11858: The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.${prompt}
  11859: Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).${prompt}
  11860: Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.${prompt}
  11861: “Wanted” objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.${prompt}
  11862: These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as “Unity accolades” to undertake.${prompt}
  11863: Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.${prompt}
  11864: Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.${prompt}
  11865: The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.${prompt}
  11866: A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.${prompt}
  11867: Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.${prompt}
  11868: Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.${prompt}
  11869: When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.${prompt}
  11870: Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  11871: No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.${prompt}
  11872: You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.${prompt}
  11873: An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.${prompt}
  11874: One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.${prompt}
  11875: A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.${prompt}
  11876: Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  11877: These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.${prompt}
  11878: Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.${prompt}
  11879: You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.${prompt}
  11880: This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.${prompt}
  11881: This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.${prompt}
  11882: However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.${prompt}
  11883: Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.${prompt}
  11884: The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.${prompt}
  11885: Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.${prompt}
  11886: Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.${prompt}
  11887: On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.${prompt}
  11888: 'Additionally, an individual''s evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by ${number: 0}. A Unity''s ranking is the average of all eligible members'' individual evaluations.${prompt}'
  11889: The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.${prompt}
  11890: Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.${prompt}
  11891: 'Those with evaluations of ${number: 0} or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.${prompt}'
  11892: Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.${prompt}
  11893: A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.${prompt}
  11894: Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.${prompt}
  11895: A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.${prompt}
  11896: It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.${prompt}

  11963: Its insatiable avarice defines it more than even it can possibly realize.${prompt}
  11964: But I am not a “human” such as you. I will be--I must be--an existence far beyond the most grandiose thought of such petty, grasping beings.${prompt}
  11965: For that is what life is. And those who cannot reach that pinnacle are fated to perish.${prompt}
  11966: Time is a cruel beast whose savageness cannot be sated.${prompt}
  11967: Every man, woman, and child feels its claws sinking into their backs, the talons digging ever deeper with each passing day.${prompt}
  11968: It marches on, unstoppable, immaterial, and unforgiving, and all any of us can do is watch it pass.${prompt}
  11969: I claimed ever greater power in pursuit of my goals until my time, too, ran out.${prompt}
  11970: All I wanted to do was protect my countrymen...my homeland...${prompt}
  11971: An alternate world, with alternate fates and alternate existences.${prompt}
  11972: I gambled my own life away to protect the world I called home.${prompt}
  11973: 'Can you truly say that you ${choice: 2}[did/would have done] any different?${prompt}'
  11974: I channeled my love for my homeland into power.${prompt}
  11975: When I fell before you...${prompt}
  11976: '...did it mean everything was for naught?${prompt}'
  11977: I, and I alone, have seen the true nature of things in this world.${prompt}
  11978: And thus, I have learned why all beings that rise must fall.${prompt}
  11979: This is a burden which I must bear and prevent from happening ever again.${prompt}
  11980: Should you not understand why my goal is pure and just, then you are unworthy of being called human.${prompt}
  11981: Open your eyes and witness the truth!${prompt}
  11982: Don't let ignorance cloud your judgment!${prompt}
  11983: ${name-player}...${prompt}
  11984: What you see before you--is it a dream, or something else?${prompt}
  11985: |-
    Is this a dream?
    ${selection-lines}
    What else could it be?
    No. It's something more...${prompt}
  11986: Come. Surely your vision cannot be that clouded.${prompt}
  11987: A keen eye, as always.${prompt}
  11988: The minds of all who have existed--and all who will exist--are as one.${prompt}
  11989: As, too, are the light and darkness inherent in the mothercrystals.${prompt}
  11990: I need not point out that the apparitions appearing before you are those whose schemes you have foiled.${prompt}
  11991: And those...${prompt}
  11992: '...Who you are destined to stop.${prompt}'
  11993: I have sought them out of my own volition, hoping to manipulate their essences for my own ends.${prompt}
  11994: Dark, infernal forces, serving as a counterbalance to the light you hope to make manifest.${prompt}
  11995: And now is the time for me to fill you with that energy. Come.${prompt}
  11996: You don't really expect to save the world, do you?${prompt}
  11997: At best you might buy it a few more phases of the moon.${prompt}
  11998: Even should I fall, there is a grand legion aching to take my place.${prompt}
  11999: So in the end, all my journeys have been utterly without meaning.${prompt}
  12000: One by one, those I have trusted have fallen. None are left to prop me up when I begin to falter.${prompt}
  12001: Hahaha...none know who I rrreally am.${prompt}
  12002: |-
    False prophets. False worlds. False adventurers...
    The truth is the pain I feel inside.${prompt}
  12003: Each combat has prepared me for the next...but in the end, it's all worthless. A new age is descending, and it threatens to leave me behind.${prompt}
  12004: Pandora's box-wox has been opened, overturned, and shaken until nothing remains inside.${prompt}
  12005: Perhaps not even your precious-wecious “hope.”
  12006: Some claim that hope is what keeps humanity sane in these trying times...yet in reality it is a prison that shuts away the real world.${prompt}
  12007: No matter how deeply darkness has penetrated your soul...${prompt}
  12008: '...no matter how much you want to give up...${prompt}'
  12009: You must not. You cannot.${prompt}
  12010: Hope is something seized, not given.${prompt}
  12011: Whether surrounded by friends or walking a hard road alone...${prompt}
  12012: There is unshaking value in seeing your path to its conclusion.${prompt}
  12013: You are the culmination of all your experiences.
  12014: Even those who are gone still depend on you.
  12015: '${name-player}, this rhapsody is yours to sing.${wait-animation: 3}'
  12016: '　　 ${wait-animation: 1}'

    醴泉島${prompt}
  12019: Master--the orb.${prompt}
  12020: You have set history on its proper course yet again, having passed through the fourth gate that stood before you.${prompt}
  12021: Yet Selh'teus's words ring true--the darkness slumbering within you is great.${prompt}
  12022: He claims that not even the crystal is enough to illuminate it.${prompt}
  12023: I must confess my trepidation at the current state of affairs. What if the darkness overcomes you not in the future, but even earlier than I had anticipated?${prompt}
  12024: What a morbid state of affairs we find ourselves in.${prompt}
  12025: We must take solace in the hope that the orb will guide you to safety, so that you will be prepared for the Reckoning.${prompt}
  12026: Until that time, your footsteps must remain unerring.${prompt}
  12027: And so fate guides you to Ceizak Battlegrounds...${prompt}
  12028: The future should have changed...${prompt}
  12029: '...And I should have been dissolved into nothingness.${prompt}'
  12030: Yet the crystal's clarion song has ceased.${prompt}
  12031: And the Cloud of Darkness threatens the world once more.${prompt}
