    The trader who I acquired these from was muttering something about terrible beasts sealed away in the far-off reaches of Bearclaw Pinnacle and the Boneyard Gully.

    Regions under beastman control.${prompt}
  7392: All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt}
  7393: Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt}
  7394: Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt}
  7395: So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt}
  7396: |-
    Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.
    They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt}
  7397: Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt}
  7398: Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt}
  7399: |-
    So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.
    We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt}

  7408: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt}
  7409: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt}
  7410: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt}
  7411: Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt}
  7412: Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt}
  7413: Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt}
  7414: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt}
  7415: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt}
  7416: |-
    Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.
    If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt}
  7417: If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt}
  7418: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt}
  7419: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt}
  7420: There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt}

  7824: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  7825: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  7826: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  7827: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  7828: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  7829: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  7830: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  7831: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  7832: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  7833: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  7834: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  7835: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  7836: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  7837: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  7838: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  7839: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  7840: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  7841: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  7842: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  7843: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  7844: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  7845: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  7846: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'
  7847: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt}
  7848: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  7849: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  7850: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
  7851: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}

    Trading cinder.${prompt}
  8248: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt}
  8249: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  8250: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt}
  8251: |-
    Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.
    If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt}
  8252: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  8253: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  8254: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  8255: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  8256: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  8257: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  8258: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  8259: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  8260: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  8261: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  8262: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  8263: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  8264: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  8265: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  8266: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  8267: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  8268: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  8269: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  8270: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  8271: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  8272: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  8273: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  8274: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  8275: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  8276: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  8277: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  8278: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  8279: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  8280: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  8281: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  8282: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  8283: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  8284: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  8285: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  8286: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  8287: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  8288: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  8289: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  8290: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  8291: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  8292: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  8293: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  8294: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  8295: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  8296: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  8297: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  8298: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  8299: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  8300: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  8301: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  8302: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  8303: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  8304: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  8305: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  8306: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  8307: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  8308: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  8309: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  8310: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  8311: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  8312: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  8313: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  8314: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  8315: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  8316: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  8317: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  8318: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  8319: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  8320: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  8321: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  8322: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  8323: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  8324: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  8325: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  8326: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  8327: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  8328: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  8329: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  8330: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  8331: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?
    Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt}

    Hmm...

    ...Alas.
    It's a shame, but it appears your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be etched.${prompt}

  8347: |-
    Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one!
    Ain't synergy grand?${prompt}
  8348: |-
    Wait! No, don't tell me.
    You strike me as a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.${prompt}

    A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living.
    Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.${prompt}
  8351: |-
    I thought you'd never ask!
    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  8352: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  8353: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'
  8354: |-
    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  8355: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  8356: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  8357: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  8358: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  8359: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  8360: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}
  8361: |-
    That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.
    Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt}

  8387: I'm not one fer beatin' 'round the bush, so I'll say it straight. What ye witnessed was a phenomenon called “noise”--the irregular brushin' of one dimension against another. Ordinary folk don't see such things, mind ye. So I s'pose that makes ye extra-ordinary.${prompt}

  8426: |-
    Now, what I'm about t' tell ye is deathly crucial, so take it t' heart.
    Stay anchored in another dimension overlong, an' what was temporary will become permanent. In other words, ye risk losin' fer good the means t' return home.${prompt}

    Eh? Looks like ye've already got yerself ${number: 2} of them.
    Sorry, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass], but no sane ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] ought have more, lest ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] risk gettin' ${choice-player-gender}[hisself/herself] stranded in Abyssea.${prompt}
  8440: |-
    Ah, sorry, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass], but I've got nothin' fully charged right now.
    Check back in a wee while, would ye?${prompt}
  8441: Here ye go, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass]. That should be enough fer now.${prompt}
  8442: I see ye've hooked yerself up with some cruor. In case ye didn't already know, these red granules first appeared when the cataclysm befell Abyssea.${prompt}
  8443: We've yet t' uncover the mystery of this strange mineral--what the hell it is, fer instance--but thanks t' its gem-like appearance, folk quickly adopted it as currency in Abyssea. ${prompt}
  8444: That's not the only reason fer its meteoric rise t' prominence, mind ye. Cruor's a highly condensed source of energy, ye see, an' has already found application in various facets of post-apocalyptic life.${prompt}
  8445: Martellos, veridical confluxes...all these things depend on cruor fer power. Can't imagine gil bein' half as useful, can ye?${prompt}
  8446: But that ain't all. By unleashin' the power of cruor, you can now instantaneously travel from here t' cavernous maws what serve as gateways t' Abyssea. Ye jus' need t' have been there once b'fore.${prompt}
  8447: Is there nothin' these little red buggers can't do? I, fer one, am beginnin' t' think not.${prompt}
  8448: If ye've a mind to teleport somewhere, jus' speak with Horst beside me here. He'll take good care of ye.${prompt}
  8449: 'It''ll take me ${number: 4} more ${choice-plurality: 4}[minute/minutes] t'' fully charge another ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} (Earth time).${prompt}'
  8450: |-
    Ye want t' know how many ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} ye've got to yer name?
    That'd be ${number: 1}, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass].${prompt}
  8451: 'Obtained key item: ${number: 1} ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  8452: 'Obtained key item: ${number: 1} ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  8453: ${name-player}. I've been told ye met some mates of mine.${prompt}
  8454: Ye ought t' know now how starved of hope me folk are, livin' each day not knowin' if it'd be the last.${prompt}
  8455: So far we've managed t' stay in the fight, puttin' up protective wards an' pitchin' warmachines into the fray, but they're temporary measures at best.${prompt}
  8456: The Abyssean hordes continue to grow, an' not a day goes by without us losin' ground t' them.${prompt}
  8457: Fer too long we've been forced onto our back foot. If we're t' have any hope of survival, we need t' go on the offensive.${prompt}
  8458: But fer this we need yer aid.${prompt}
  8459: I beg ye, ${name-player}! Help us turn the tide of battle in our favor!${prompt}
  8460: ${name-player}! I couldn't believe me ears when first I heard the news!${prompt}
  8461: |-
    Yer exploits against the Abyssean hordes've allowed us t' escape the rut we're in.
    Fer once I find meself thankin' the gods fer strandin' me in this world.${prompt}
  8462: |-
    With yer help, there's hope yet fer Abyssea.
    Why, there're even some as say it might be restored to its former glory!${prompt}
  8463: I meself am not one fer countin' eggs afore they're hatched, but one thing's fer certain:${prompt}
  8464: The seed of hope has sprouted!${prompt}
  8465: A seedling it is still, but lit with determination and watered with perseverance, into a great, towerin' oak it'll surely grow!${prompt}
  8466: A long road stretches far ahead of us...${prompt}
  8467: But with yer help, ${name-player}, we'll follow it one step at a time...'til the day we reach its end!${prompt}
  8468: Ah, there ye are, ${name-player}. I was wonderin' when next ye'd turn up.${prompt}
  8469: There be somethin' I need t' ask of ye. Well, t' be precise, there be someone I'd like ye t' meet.${prompt}
  8470: |-
    Due t' reasons beyond our control, the man can't be here. So instead he'll be waitin' for ye at the stone circle in the La Theine Plateau.
    I trust a veteran adventurer such as yerself knows how t' navigate ${choice-player-gender}[himself/herself] there.${prompt}
  8471: |-
    Truly sorry fer this sudden request, but circumstances won't allow fer a meetin' t' take place here.
    I'd explain the reason why, except I'm sworn t' silence on this.${prompt}
  8472: |-
    Go meet the mystery man?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oooh, I love mysteries!
    Sounds a little shady...${prompt}
  8473: |-
    I beg fer yer understandin', ${name-player}.
    Ye know I'd tell ye all if I could, but this is jus' the way it's gotta be.${prompt}
  8474: |-
    I'm in yer debt yet again, ${name-player}.
    Now, as I said, ye'll meet yer man at the stone circle in La Theine. Thing is, due t' the stones' properties, he can't be there fer long stretches of time.${prompt}
  8475: Only from dusk till dawn can he cross over t' this world. Be keepin' that in mind.${prompt}
  8476: I don't blame ye if ye're feelin' reserved about meetin' this mystery man, but I assure ye, he's a real dinkum bloke.${prompt}
  8477: Jus' take yerself over t' the rendezvous point, an' he'll seek ye out. It's simple as meat pie.${prompt}
  8478: Go well, ${name-player}. Be seein' ye again real soon.${prompt}
  8479: |-
    Welcome back, ${name-player}.
    It seems the meetin' went without incident.${prompt}
  8480: I trust ye understand now why the man couldn't come t' Jeuno.${prompt}
  8481: Bein' an underworld figure of sorts, it wouldn't do if he were seen paradin' himself hereabouts.${prompt}
  8482: Doubtless he's already bent yer ears 'bout havin' been a pirate back in the day, runnin' his operations out of Elshimo.${prompt}
  8483: Considerin' how well-traveled an adventurer ye are, I reckon ye already knew the man.${prompt}
  8484: But I won't probe ye on that subject. Some things are best left untouched, t' be sure.${prompt}
  8485: |-
    I find meself sayin' this often of late, but yer aid has allowed hope t' sprout among the survivors.
    If ye were t' ask me if mankind's made any real progress, though, the answer would be a resoundin' “no.”${prompt}
  8486: |-
    The survivors're more organized than afore, true, but our fundamental plight be as grim as ever.
    The Abyssean hordes attack, an' we beat them back as best we can. An' when we're not busy fendin' off monsters, we're scrapin' up what livin' we can, foragin' fer food what can still be had.${prompt}
  8487: |-
    None of this has changed, ${name-player}, an' I suspect that be why ye were called out t' La Theine.
    Rumors of yer feats aren't like t' escape the notice of key resistance folk fer long. Soon or late, they'd look ye up, hopin' t' recruit yer aid in gettin' us out of this rut.${prompt}
  8488: |-
    Hit the nail fair on the head, did I?
    I'm not the only one who sees great things in ye, ${name-player}, an' fer good reason.${prompt}
  8489: Me comrades an' I crossed over t' this world, desperately searchin' fer a way t' save our home.${prompt}
  8490: An' in the midst o' our despair, we found our ray of hope in strong, compassionate folk such as yerself.${prompt}
  8491: Uncoverin' the truth an' restorin' Abyssea t' its erstwhile state--these things've proven t' be far beyond the power of me folk t' accomplish alone.${prompt}
  8492: I beg ye, ${name-player}, please keep lendin' us yer strength! Stand with us t' the bloody end!${prompt}
  8493: |-
    How will you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    If you need a hero, look no further!
    It's just too big a commitment.${prompt}
  8494: "Words alone aren't enough t' express me gratitude, ${name-player}. \nWith yer help, Abyssea will surely again be restored t' the beauteous realm she once was.${prompt}"
  8495: |-
    I know I ask much of ye, ${name-player}, an' fer that I'm sorry.
    We'd still appreciate yer aid, though, in whatever quantity ye can offer. Please jus' don't turn yer back on us.${prompt}
  8496: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}. Always a sight fer sore eyes.
    I've got a message fer ye here, from ye-know-who. Needs t' speak with ye again, he says.${prompt}
  8497: |-
    The location's the same, out at the stone circle in La Theine.
    As fer the time, remember what I told ye earlier.${prompt}
  8498: While I'm not privy t' the purpose of this next meetin', I know the man wouldn't cross over here fer whimsical reasons.${prompt}
  8499: That he'd come again so soon doesn't bode well, I fear...${prompt}
  8500: The meetin' went all right, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass]?${prompt}
  8501: |-
    Aye, the old man's certainly fond o' talkin'.
    Mind ye don't go divulgin' the conversation t' me or the others, though.${prompt}
  8502: Were it somethin' meant fer our ears, we would've already heard about it.${prompt}
  8503: Certain things are confidential fer a reason, I think ye'll agree.${prompt}
  8504: |-
    I'd be a great big liar if I said I wasn't at all curious.
    On the other hand, though, I fear what learnin' the truth might be liable t' do t' me sanity.${prompt}
  8505: Countless unbelievable things've come t' pass since that fateful day.${prompt}
  8506: Afore the cataclysm, any talk of dimensional travel would've been met with ridicule.${prompt}
  8507: Lookin' back, we were all happier then, blissful in our ignorance.${prompt}
  8508: |-
    Wakin' up one day, suddenly findin' meself capable o' traversin' dimensions...that was a bloody huge shock, I tell ye.
    But I digress...${prompt}
  8509: Gilgamesh claims not t' possess full knowledge of things, but it's clear enough he's better informed than most.${prompt}
  8510: |-
    I've got a hunch that be part of the reason why he specifically picked ye out.
    I won't badger ye fer the details, though.${prompt}
  8511: |-
    I've got me own job t' do, an' I mean t' do it well.
    I must continue recruitin' strong adventurers t' aid our plight.${prompt}
  8512: And ye, ${name-player}. Me comrades an' I hope we can keep relyin' on yer trusty sword arm.${prompt}
  8513: I trust yer journeys in Abyssea've introduced ye t' the defensive structures we call martellos.${prompt}
  8514: |-
    The ones garrisoned in Vunkerl, Attohwa, and Misareaux are earlier models what need t' have their power augmented from a central location.
    An outpost has been established in each area especially fer this purpose.${prompt}
  8515: |-
    However, the Abyssean fiends've somehow caught wind of the outposts' true nature.
    Since then they've been hell-bent on tearin' them t' the ground.${prompt}
  8516: |-
    If an outpost were t' fall, the effectiveness of all martellos in the area'd be gravely compromised.
    Suffice it t' say, that'd be right disastrous fer the resistance effort.${prompt}
  8517: |-
    I realize ye're already doin' much fer us, but the outposts sorely lack fer defenders.
    I'd volunteer meself fer the job, weren't I stuck here in Vana'diel.${prompt}
  8518: |-
    I beseech ye, ${name-player}, help us t' defend the outposts!
    Think of it as doin' a personal favor fer me!${prompt}
  8519: Ye never cease t' amaze me, ${name-player}. Why, not only did ye shine in yer defense of the outposts, ye even managed t' slay those vicious fiends what've wreaked havoc upon us fer so long.${prompt}
  8520: Words can't express how glad I am t' have ye fightin' on our side.${prompt}
  8521: |-
    Ah, what I wouldn't give t' possess even half yer strength--t' be able t' do somethin' fer me own folk.
    But...there's somethin' I mus' confess.${prompt}
  8522: |-
    A part of me's grateful fer bein' stranded here. Thankful that I never again have t' set foot upon that hell on earth.
    That I think such cowardly thoughts...it racks me with guilt, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8523: Ye...ye understand how I feel, ye say?${prompt}
  8524: |-
    Ye truly are a kindhearted soul.
    It's a rare ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who possesses both strength an' compassion in abundance like ye.${prompt}
  8525: |-
    Please forgive me fer that unseemly display.
    The pressures of me world's plight can be overwhelmin' at times.${prompt}
  8526: ${name-player}. I pray ye never cease t' be the ray of hope fer the folk of Abyssea.${prompt}
  8527: Oh, my... Such a pristine, untainted world...${prompt}
  8528: |-
    Greetings, friend. Delighted to finally meet you.
    My name is Horst, and I have the utmost pleasure of being Joachim's assistant.${prompt}
  8529: I also derive much pleasure from assisting the brave, selfless souls who have made our cause their own.${prompt}
  8530: If there is anything you wish to know regarding Abyssea, it would delight me so to share my knowledge with you.${prompt}
  8531: |-
    What would you like to ask about?
    ${selection-lines}
    My current cruor balance.
    Resistance outpost status.
    Teleporting to a cavernous maw.
    Nothing right now.${prompt}
  8532: 'According to my logbook--which is kept to the highest standards--you have ${number: 0} cruor in your possession.${prompt}'
  8533: |-
    Ask about which area?
    ${selection-lines}
    Abyssea - Vunkerl.
    Abyssea - Misareaux.
    Abyssea - Attohwa.
    Never mind.${prompt}
  8534: According to the latest intelligence reports...${prompt}
  8535: |-
    This area's pulse martello defense rate presently stands at ${number: 0}%.
    The likelihood of an Abyssean horde invasion, on the other hand, is ${number: 1}%.${prompt}
  8536: |-
    You'd like to teleport to a cavernous maw?
    Through the power of the little red pretties we call cruor, I shall be overjoyed to assist you!${prompt}
  8537: |-
    Go to which area's gateway?
    ${selection-lines}
    Abyssea - La Theine.
    Abyssea - Konschtat.
    Abyssea - Tahrongi.
    Abyssea - Vunkerl.
    Abyssea - Misareaux.
    Abyssea - Attohwa.
    Abyssea - Altepa.
    Abyssea - Uleguerand.
    Abyssea - Grauberg.
    I've changed my mind.${prompt}
  8538: '${number: 1} cruor is required to teleport to the gateway to Abyssea - ${choice: 0}[La Theine/Konschtat/Tahrongi/Attohwa/Misareaux/Vunkerl/Altepa/Uleguerand/Grauberg].${prompt}'
  8539: Oh, my, it seems you don't have enough cruor.${prompt}
  8540: |-
    Will you proceed? (Cruor balance: ${number: 2})
    ${selection-lines}
    Make it so.
    Make it no.${prompt}
  8541: "These martellos are defensive fortifications developed by the resistance to aid in our battle against the fell hordes.\nEnchanted structures, they may be employed to restore your health and magic, cure ailments, and generally restore you to fighting trim.${prompt} "
  8542: I have been entrusted with the supervision and maintenance of these martellos...but this is none of your concern.${prompt}
  8543: |-
    I have been entrusted with the supervision and maintenance of these martellos.
    Would you be needing something of me?${prompt}
  8544: |-
    Need something?
    ${selection-lines}
    Assist with replenishment.
    Assist with upgrades.
    Martellos? Come again?
    Nothing in particular.${prompt}
  8545: |-
    Splendid! Your aid is a great boon to the resistance effort.
    To replenish a martello, you'll need to insert one of these ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} into the structure.${prompt}
  8546: 'Be forewarned: you will be unable to carry these and ${keyitem-plural: 1[2]} at the same time.${prompt}'
  8547: |-
    Take along the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  8548: |-
    We would be particularly indebted to you for efficient replenishment of martellos in remote locations.
    Best of luck in your efforts!${prompt}
  8549: |-
    Why, is that not ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} already in your posssesion?
    You need only insert that into a martello to initiate replenishment.${prompt}
  8550: |-
    I see that you currently possess ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.
    Do you wish to abandon your upgrading efforts and participate in replenishment instead?${prompt}
  8551: 'You return the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and obtain ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} in its stead!${prompt}'
  8552: |-
    Your support is most heartening in these dark times.
    Upgrading a martello will require you to attach a device known as ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  8553: |-
    Mind you, the device is rather unwieldy.
    You will not be able to carry it and ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} at the same time.${prompt}
  8554: |-
    Excellent. I would be especially appreciative if you could upgrade those martellos in distant locations--the quicker the better.
    Be careful out there!${prompt}
  8555: |-
    Hm? Is that not ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} you hold in your hand?
    You need only find the martello you wish to upgrade, and attach it.${prompt}
  8556: |-
    Is that ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} I see?
    Do you wish to curtail your replenishment activities and assist with upgrading instead?${prompt}
  8557: |-
    Welcome back, friend! Allow me to take that ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} off your hands.
    How did you fare in your efforts?${prompt}
  8558: |-
    I see, I see... Martello #0${number: 1}, you say?
    It sounds as if the operation was ${choice: 0}[a modest success./a reasonable success./a rousing success!/an unqualified success!]${prompt}
  8559: |-
    The resistance greatly values your contributions.
    Take this as a small token of our appreciation, and do not hesitate to return the next time you are willing to lend your support.${prompt}
  8560: |-
    I've been working with these here martellos since I was knee-high.
    Ask away, and my knowledge is yours.${prompt}
  8561: |-
    Ask something?
    ${selection-lines}
    So, what's a martello?
    Martello replenishment.
    Martello upgrades.
    Cautionary notes.
    Not now.${prompt}
  8562: |-
    The device we know as the martello was first developed by military engineers many years past, during an age of great war.
    Martellos serve to keep combatants fighting fit, healing their wounds and restoring their mental energies.${prompt}
  8563: You will observe that martellos have been constructed in numerous locales, so as to provide strategically located safe havens for harried resistance fighters. No doubt you will find yourself making use of them as well.${prompt}
  8564: In the bowels of each martello is contained a tank designed to hold martello fuel.${prompt}
  8565: |-
    This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is the lifeblood of the martello, and the source of its curative powers.
    Depleted stores will render the device little more than an oversized parchmentweight.${prompt}
  8566: That being the case, we're in continual need of volunteers willing to take on the vital task of replenishing these martellos.${prompt}
  8567: |-
    I have been charged with overseeing a supply of martello fuel.
    Should you be willing to take part in a replenishment run, you need only say the word.
    Needless to say, you will not go unrewarded for your efforts.${prompt}
  8568: |-
    Feast your eyes on this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. She's a beauty, isn't she?
    Installing one of these into a martello will increase its fuel capacity.${prompt}
  8569: |-
    An upgraded martello will be able to sustain its energy stores for a longer time between replenishment operations.
    Needless to say, this is a blessing and a half to those on the battlefield.${prompt}
  8570: |-
    Unfortunately, the installation procedure is quite complex.
    As such, we can only entrust it to experienced hands.${prompt}
  8571: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} are quite large and unwieldy.
    Even the burliest among us would be unable to carry one and ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} at the same time.${prompt}
  8572: Furthermore, these materials are quite unstable, and will rapidly corrode and be rendered useless if brought outside our immediate environs.${prompt}
  8573: '''Course, not that anyone could manage to travel that far, what with these fearsome landslides...${prompt}'
  8574: |-
    ${color-alt: 121}Warning:
    Changing areas, logging out, or becoming disconnected will cause all data pertinent to this quest to be reset.
  8575: 'Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has been lost.'
  8576: |-
    The resistance is currently suffering a materials shortage.
    Those wishing to participating in replenishment and upgrading operations should return at a later time.${prompt}
  8577: 'The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} breaks!'
  8578: 'Table: ${number: 0}'
  8579: Grauberg, Altepa Desert, Uleguerand Range...${prompt}
  8580: |-
    The monsters what prowl these three areas in Abyssea are right frightful, I tell ye.
    Why, the ones ye've dealt with so far would seem as tame kittens beside 'em.${prompt}
  8581: |-
    But that ain't the half of it, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass].
    Even if ye took away the threat of nasty beasties, Altepa an' Uleguerand are in an' of themselves perilous places.${prompt}
  8582: These two locales represent some of the world's harshest environments, utterly ill-suited fer sustainin' life.${prompt}
  8583: We gotta make haste an' pave an evacuation route fer the survivors, else they won't be in the survivin' business fer much longer.${prompt}
  8584: The casualties are mountin' even as we speak, ${name-player}, folk dyin' of exposure, starvation, simple maladies...${prompt}
  8585: I know we've played out this scene upwards of a dozen times...but I mus' ask fer yer help yet again.${prompt}
  8586: I beg ye, ${name-player}! Please do what ye can fer the embattled folk of Abyssea!${prompt}
  8587: |-
    By the heavens, ${name-player}! Ye truly did it...ye did fer that detestable menace!
    Is there no limit t' yer potential, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass]?${prompt}
  8588: |-
    When word of yer amazin' deed reached me ears, me whole body fair trembled with excitement.
    With a staunch comrade such as ye fightin' beside us, there's nothin' me folk and I need fear.${prompt}
  8589: Now, I'm not so naive as t' celebrate prematurely. I know full well it'll take much time an' effort yet afore our former lives are restored.${prompt}
  8590: But we've managed t' cast off the shackles of despair, a right momentous first step.${prompt}
  8591: |-
    The situation's taken a turn fer the better all across the land, an' we owe it all t' ye, ${name-player}.
    I honestly don't know where we'd be without ye.${prompt}
  8592: |-
    From what vile loins were the Abyssean hordes spawned? And why did the sky take on a bloody red?
    Questions such as these remain unanswered, t' be sure.${prompt}
  8593: But with the aid of ye an' yers, we're gettin' closer an' closer t' uncoverin' the truth.${prompt}
  8594: |-
    Ah, don't be takin' me comment the wrong way, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass].
    The help ye've already afforded us verges on immeasurable, an' it's not me intention t' put undue pressure on ye.${prompt}
  8595: Havin' said that, I hope ye'll stand with us through t' the very end.${prompt}
  8596: |-
    The location's different this time, mind ye.
    Ye ever heard of the Hall of the Gods, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass]?${prompt}
  8597: |-
    I'll fill ye in on the directions, jus' fer good measure.
    T' get there, first leave the Meriphataud Mountains from the northeast. Ye should find yerself standin' in the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah, the gateway way t' the Li'Telor Region.${prompt}
  8598: Make yer way north through the coniferous forest, an ye'll wind up in the sprawlin' ruins of Ro'Maeve. Proceed further on in, an' ye'll eventually come upon the Hall of the Gods.${prompt}
  8599: |-
    In olden times, the place was said t' be the destination fer many a pilgrim.
    Nowadays, though, ye're more like t' bump into spirits. There's nary a better place fer hush-hush dealings, I reckon.${prompt}

  8735: Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt}
  8736: You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt}
  8737: Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt}
  8738: |-
    Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.
    I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt}
  8739: |-
    Invisible to you, at least.
    It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt}

  8741: |-
    I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.

    Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.
    So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt}
  8744: For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt}
  8745: |-
    Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!
    It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt}
  8746: Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt}
  8747: |-
    If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!
    No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”
    Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt}
  8748: Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt}
  8749: If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt}

  8828: I had no idea adventurers possessed so much free time. No matter how many times you ask, it will be ready when it is ready...unless you would rather I hand you a half-finished piece of scrap.${prompt}
  8829: Of course I could never bring myself to hand back a work in progress. You will wait your full day and you will like it, hear me?${prompt}

    I'm not confident...${prompt}
  9011: Ah, Lady Prishe. 'Tis good to see you looking your usual chipper self.${prompt}
  9012: '''Course I am.${prompt}'
  9013: Gimme a break. You keep spewing a load of crap about the end of the world, so how else am I supposed to react?${prompt}
  9014: We already put a lid on that messy business, so there's nothing left to worry about!${prompt}
  9015: Lady Prishe...? Are you feeling ill?${prompt}
  9016: Why, most certainly.${prompt}
  9017: How else would one feel when an old friend comes bearing ill tidings about the end of the world?${prompt}
  9018: Have we not already solved this problem? Why would it rear its ugly head anew? It's enough to set my head swimming!${prompt}
  9019: Ah, that would explain it. I must confess to having difficulty discerning my right from my left as well these past weeks...${prompt}
  9020: This creepy old coot rushes in and starts blabbing about dying world this, dark future that...ugh. It was all I could do not to smack him right in the kisser!${prompt}
  9021: The blood rushed to my head and now it's pounding like I just ran face-first into a wall!${prompt}
  9022: Ah. Well, that solves the mystery of his obnoxious prattling.${prompt}
  9023: Then this whole “Emptiness” thing's gotta be connected, right?${prompt}
  9024: And you mean to say that it's our destiny to send it packing?${prompt}
  9025: This crazy ninja lady burst into my place in Tavnazia and dragged me over here kicking and screaming.${prompt}
  9026: She said Despachiaire would never miss me, what with the way he's got his eye on Ulmia like a hawk.${prompt}
  9027: Think it's safe for me to be here?${prompt}
  9028: Lady Prishe, surely Kagero explained to you the gravity of the situation.${prompt}
  9029: All those close to you, whether in Tavnazia or beyond, are in grave danger.${prompt}
  9030: You shoulda heard Tenzen prattle on! Dying world this, dark future that...ugh. It was all I could do not to smack him right in the kisser!${prompt}

  9032: Lady Prishe, are you not the least bit concerned!?${prompt}
  9033: All those close to you, whether in Tavnazia or beyond, are in grave danger!${prompt}
  9034: Yeah, yeah. But what good does it do any of us to sit here with our thumbs up our butts moaning about it?${prompt}
  9035: Less talk, more action!${prompt}
  9036: A most becoming response. But how are we to act when we know so little?${prompt}
  9037: Didn't you mention something 'bout a delicate little waif from the future who had all the answers?${prompt}
  9038: Unfortunately, although Iroha can see the grand picture, there are many details that escape her.${prompt}
  9039: The one most familiar with the situation is he who came after her.${prompt}
  9040: This ambassador from the void guy, yeah. I've half a mind to rip that mask from his scrawny little neck and expose him for the sham he is!${prompt}
  9041: And this would be your masked ambassador from the void?${prompt}
  9042: Would that our paths had crossed, but I know only his name.${prompt}

    How do you respond?

    He was fearsome.

  9048: Next time the pounding will come right from me!${prompt}
  9049: So you did not come into direct conflict?${prompt}
  9050: I know we can claim victory the next time if we work together!${prompt}
  9051: That's the ${name-player} I know and love!${prompt}
  9052: Hang on--you didn't actually smack him around, did you!?${prompt}
  9053: Can't fool me! My fingers start to twitch whenever someone's trying to finagle their way out of the truth!${prompt}
  9054: That's wonderful news!${prompt}
  9055: Wait. Was that...a joke?${prompt}
  9056: How undeniably cruel! Why would you get any enjoyment out of toying with me?${prompt}
  9057: Thinkin' he can just snatch victory like candy from a babe, no doubt!${prompt}
  9058: Let him do what he wants, I say! I'll mangle his face so bad he'll never dare to remove that mask!${prompt}
  9059: If he's as impressive as you claim, I would surely like to meet him.${prompt}
  9060: But goodness, my knees would certainly turn to jelly.${prompt}
  9061: This is no time for nonsense. That man can call forth voids at will.${prompt}
  9062: Wait...there's something desperately wrong...${prompt}
  9063: Hm?
  9064: Aaaaaah!
  9065: Hm?
  9066: Eeep!
  9067: There is no need for concern, Lady Prishe.${prompt}
  9068: The same thing happened earlier. The orb filling with light--this is what Iroha was mentioning, is it not?${prompt}
  9069: Urk! I thought the damn thing was trying to rip my soul from my body!${prompt}
  9070: Lady Prishe, I assure you no such thing would occur.${prompt}
  9071: Hmph. Long as I'm still in one piece I couldn't give a flying fig.${prompt}
  9072: But let's track back a minute to where we can find this Iroha of yours.${prompt}
  9073: I...I felt like my soul was being ripped from my body!${prompt}
  9074: Thank the heavens! Hopefully my shivers will calm down...${prompt}
  9075: But wait--where can we find Iroha?${prompt}

    What do you think?
    ${selection-lines}
    Maybe she got lost?
    She didn't seem well.
    Think she forgot?${prompt}
  9079: Only in the most dire of circumstances is a priestess from Reisenjima Sanctorium permitted to leave the tiny island.${prompt}
  9080: And now she might be lost in this most bustling of towns--I must find her before something happens!!!${prompt}
  9081: So you're saying she let it hurl? That can't be good.${prompt}
  9082: Whatever shall we do?${prompt}
  9083: A priestess's calling is to remain sheltered in her cloister and pray to the gods.${prompt}
  9084: And now she might be lost in this most bustling of towns--I must find her before something happens!!!${prompt}
  9085: She probably caught a whiff of some sausages or something and is gorging herself as we speak.${prompt}
  9086: Lady Prishe, a priestess from the Far East is not tempted by such carnal desires.${prompt}
  9087: Well, she must have found some stunning number and is flitting from store to store wasting ponzes of gil on cute little baubles.${prompt}
  9088: Ahem. Our priestesses take vows of poverty, and I highly doubt that centuries-old tradition will have changed in the future.${prompt}
  9089: Then I bet someone beat her up and left her lying in a ditch!${prompt}
  9090: Perhaps the delectable scent of sausages enticed her?${prompt}
  9091: Well...maybe she found some delightful dress and is spending her hours at the clothiers?${prompt}
  9092: What if...what if someone accosted her!?${prompt}
  9093: D-do you think that's possible!?
  9094: I must find her before it is too late!!!${prompt}
  9095: I should probably head off to find her, too.${prompt}
  9096: Maybe she made her way to Lower Jeuno?${prompt}
  9097: This whole incident has me quite concerned. Perhaps it is best if I join in the search.${prompt}
  9098: I'll see what I can find in Lower Jeuno.${prompt}
  9099: Hmm... It seems I can never find the perrrfect person. Although, I know that one day, somebody'll come along... Mwahaha!${prompt}
  9100: Oh! What do we have here!? Yes! You're just the perrrson I've been looking for!${prompt}
  9101: 'Mwahaha. Let me guess, you''re a craftsman skilled in the art of ${choice: 0}[/woodworking/smithing/goldsmithing/clothcraft/leathercraft/bonecraft/alchemy/cooking]. Am I rrright?${prompt}'
  9102: No, don't answer that, my frrriend. I can tell just by looking at you!${prompt}
  9103: I have a favor to ask. Please, hear me out.${prompt}
  9104: Firrrst, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Mewk Chorosap. I'm a member of the Inventors' Coalition in Adoulin.${prompt}
  9105: See, that's where you come in. I need your help with a new item I'm worrrking on. Mwahaha.${prompt}
  9106: Recently, I've been interrrested in crystal synthesis. In all of Vana'diel, the Middle Lands is known more than any other area for using crystal synthesis.${prompt}
  9107: Therefore, I took a trrrip to see how the process works.${prompt}
  9108: I'm so glad I came here! I can actually picture it now! A bright future where my technology and crystal synthesis are fused together in glorrrious harmony!${prompt}
  9109: Mwahahaha!${prompt}
  9110: Since you are a big part of this future, I want you to have this prrresent.${prompt}
  9111: You see, this is a kind of item to support and even enhance your efforts when it comes to synthesizing items.${prompt}
  9112: Of course, right now, it's just an orrrdinary shield.${prompt}
  9113: When synthesizing crystals, one's mind plays an imporrrtant part in visualizing the finished product.${prompt}
  9114: The power of the mind is also requirrred by this shield.${prompt}
  9115: So when craftsmen like yourself equip this shield, and try really hard to synthesize items over and over again, your blood, sweat, tears, and your very soul itself will be poured into the shield.${prompt}
  9116: I have coined the term “Craftsmanship” to describe the arrrt of imbuing the strength of one's mind into an object.${prompt}
  9117: Once your Craftsmanship reaches a cerrrtain level, you will be able to synthesize a crystal.${prompt}
  9118: You can then combine that crystal with special ingrrredients from the Inventors' Coalition to use on the shield I gave you.${prompt}
  9119: If it all goes according to plan, you'll end up with a brrrand-new shield.${prompt}
  9120: By crrrafting the shield over and over again, you can boost its ability to its maximum value.${prompt}
  9121: 'I have left the necessary ingredients with the ${choice: 0}[/Carpenters''/Smithing/Goldsmiths''/Weavers''/Tanners''/Boneworkers''/Alchemists''/Culinarians''] Guild, so please check with your guildmaster.${prompt}'
  9122: However, I've asked them to not just give you the ingredients without worrrking for them.${prompt}
  9123: It wouldn't be interrresting if just anybody could make such a powerful thing. Mwahaha.${prompt}
  9124: I'll give you the shield, so what do you say? Are you interrrested in making it even more powerful? Of course, the road to its completion will be fraught with peril.${prompt}
  9125: '${color-alt: 121}Once you have started to craft an escutcheon, your ${choice: 0}[/woodworking/blacksmithing/goldsmithing/weaving/leathcraft/bonecraft/alchemy/cooking] skill will not reduce until the shield is completed or you cancel the process.'

    What will you do?
    ${selection-lines}
    Leave it to me!
    I think I better pass.${prompt}
  9127: Really? Well, I suppose even if I did give it to somebody whose hearrrt wasn't in it, it wouldn't go very well. In that case, I'll take the shield back then.${prompt}
  9128: If you ever feel like showing me what you're trrruly made of, I'll be here waiting for you. Mwahaha.${prompt}
  9129: Mwahahaha. I knew you had it in you. I suppose I lit a fire within that crrraftsman's heart of yours.${prompt}
  9130: Now then. Show that shield to your guildmaster. The path forward will be rrrevealed to you.${prompt}
  9131: When you're finished, you'll need to receive a sign on the shield from your guildmaster that it's finished. Then brrring it back to me. I'm counting on you. Mwahaha.${prompt}
  9132: 'Why hello there, my ${choice: 0}[/woodworking/smithing/goldsmithing/clothcraft/leathercraft/bonecraft/alchemy/cooking] expert. What is the prrroblem?${prompt}'

    I want to try making the shield.
    I give up trying to make the shield.${prompt}
  9134: Mwahahaha. In that case, good luck to you, my frrriend.${prompt}
  9135: How's that shield coming? Finished yet?${prompt}
  9136: Good. Now let me have a look.${prompt}
  9137: Mwahaha. It's nice to see you're up for the challenge, my frrriend.${prompt}
  9138: In that case, I'll need to give you this.${prompt}
  9139: In rrregards to the other ingredients, I mentioned this before, but you'll need to speak with your guildmaster.${prompt}
  9140: 'At least, that''s what I would say if you still didn''t have that ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Dispose of it firrrst.${prompt}'
  9141: Oh, what happened to give you a change of hearrrt? Are you sure you want to quit?${prompt}
  9142: '${color-alt: 124}Note that reattempting will require you to abandon your current shield in progress.'
  9143: Really abandon your current shield?${prompt}
  9144: |-
    Do you really want to quit?
    ${selection-lines}
    On second thought, I'll stick with it.
    Yes, I've had enough.${prompt}
  9145: Mwahaha. That's what I like to hear. Keep up the good worrrk.${prompt}
  9146: Well, that is most unforrrtunate.${prompt}
  9147: That shield will do you no good, so be surrre to get rid of it.${prompt}
  9148: Mwahaha. I've been waiting for this. Let's see what you've brrrought me.${prompt}
  9149: It must've been hard when you firrrst started using this shield. It is difficult to get your spirit in tune with the crystal.${prompt}
  9150: Hmm...${prompt}
  9151: Yes, I imagined as much, but was hoping it'd turn out better.${prompt}
  9152: This is nowhere near the level I was expecting to see.${prompt}
  9153: I suppose a single upgrrrade is only enough to bring it this far. Although, there is no denying that it has gained some ability.${prompt}
  9154: Mwahaha. Can I have a little more time? It looks like I need to rrrethink the design a bit.${prompt}
  9155: Here, take this shield. And I forrrbid you from losing it.${prompt}
  9156: Once the prrreparations are complete, you'll need to perform the next upgrade. I hope you're looking forward to it as much as I am.${prompt}
  9157: (Hmm... Maybe mythril alone makes the spiritual link too weak? In that case, I'll need a differrrent metal. What could I use instead...)${prompt}
  9158: Hm? Mwahaha. I see you are eager to get starrrted. I need just a little more time.${prompt}
  9159: I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. My prrreparations are complete. Mwahaha.${prompt}
  9160: 'I''m going to get it rrready for the upgrade, so can I borrow the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for a moment?${prompt}'
  9161: Thank you. Okay, this won't take very long, so just wait a little longer.${prompt}
  9162: There. That should do the trrrick.${prompt}
  9163: Take this and trrry the synthesis again multiple times.${prompt}
  9164: Once your spirit has been sufficiently imbued into the shield, you can try crrrafting the shield again.${prompt}
  9165: The ingrrredients have been left with your guild, so speak to your guildmaster for more information.${prompt}
  9166: Simply show this shield to your parrrticular guildmaster and they'll know what to do.${prompt}
  9167: I'm interrrested to see what this shield can become. Yes, very interested indeed. Mwahaha.${prompt}
  9168: Mwahaha... I've been anxiously awaiting your rrreturn. So, how did it turn out?${prompt}
  9169: I see...${prompt}
  9170: It falls within the rrrange I was expecting, based on the results of our previous attempt.${prompt}
  9171: Splendid. I think you'll rrreally see an improvement with the next upgrade!${prompt}
  9172: Mwahaha. I'll prrrepare the next ingredient for the Inventors' Coalition.${prompt}
  9173: Be sure to make the next upgrade once the preparations are rrready. Mwahaha.${prompt}

  9186: It would appear that parrrticular factor is hounding us once again...${prompt}
  9187: However, there's no need to let it get us down. I've learrrned a way to mitigate its effects. Mwahaha.${prompt}
  9188: Crafting under cerrrtain conditions enables you to boost Craftsmanship more than usual, yes?${prompt}
  9189: When you take advantage of that situation, the factor is trrriggered, making your life more difficult.${prompt}
  9190: However, if you don't utilize this parrrticular condition, the effect of the factor grows stronger and stronger, meaning you should try to use it as much as possible.${prompt}
  9191: Were you able to comprrrehend all that? At any rate, simply show this shield to your guildmaster like before.${prompt}
  9192: Actually, I can't have you bothering your guildmaster all the time, so I'll explain part of the prrrocess here.${prompt}

  9241: That is why I've crrreated a special device to help assist with the crafting process.${prompt}
  9242: 'Using this “synthesis focuser” during your crafting sessions will help boost your spirit and imbue it within your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  9243: You just need to simply flip the switch and begin crafting, although some prrreparations are necessary.${prompt}
  9244: 'You''ll need to place the ${item-singular: 0[2]} inside the synthesis focuser, along with the crystal, crafting sphere, and catalyst needed for the crafting process.${prompt}'
  9245: For the crystal, please note that you cannot use the high-quality crystals or analysis crystals used for the engraving prrrocess.${prompt}
  9246: 'I''m going to place the ${item-singular: 0[2]} within the synthesis focuser for now.${prompt}'
  9247: Once the materials are set, you can begin the crafting process.${prompt}
  9248: 'If everything goes as planned, it will infuse your ${item-singular: 0[2]} with a large amount of spirit. Once a sufficient amount has been trrransferred, it will activate the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  9249: Did you manage to comprrrehend all that? If so, then I shall continue...${prompt}
  9250: With this parrrticular kind of crafting, you're also able to form “links” while crafting!${prompt}
  9251: I like to call this type of link a “craftchain”. I know... I know... It's nothing fancy. Mwahaha.${prompt}
  9252: You alrrready know about the skillchains that you use in battle. This is kind of like that.${prompt}
  9253: The skillchain is triggered when you select the appropriate weapon skills with the proper timing, right?${prompt}
  9254: A craftchain is triggered when you use the proper crafting sphere and catalyst, also with the proper timing.${prompt}
  9255: Once the craftchain is triggered, it will boost your spirit by an even greater amount. You really want to use them if at all possible.${prompt}
  9256: Now, allow me to explain about the crafting spheres that I mentioned prrreviously.${prompt}
  9257: Crafting spheres are a type of material that are intricately linked with crystals and craftchains.${prompt}
  9258: This'll prrrobably go faster if I just show you one.${prompt}
  9259: 'This is what we call ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  9260: 'And since Liquefaction includes a fire elemental, you will need to use ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}'
  9261: Be sure to keep one thing in mind. If you use a crystal that doesn't match the element, the synthesis is guaranteed to fail.${prompt}
  9262: There are 14 types of crafting sphere in all, the same number as the skillchains, with the exception of the Ultimate Skillchains of courrrse.${prompt}
  9263: However, you will need to learrrn the linking procedure for yourself.${prompt}
  9264: Now I will explain about the other material in the prrrocess...the catalyst.${prompt}
  9265: The catalyst is a material that has a grrreat effect on the success of your craftchain.${prompt}
  9266: You already know how skillchains have levels, rrright?${prompt}
  9267: Craftchains also have levels, and you will need to use a catalyst that matches the element of the crafting sphere.${prompt}
  9268: I have here an example of a catalyst. It comes from the Inventors' Coalition's verrry own MC-I-SR0 series!${prompt}
  9269: The linking process has thrrree levels, just like with skillchains. Depending on the crafting sphere you use, the catalyst will be selected automatically.${prompt}
  9270: Now I'd like to explain crafting failures in a bit more detail.${prompt}
  9271: If your combination of crystal, crafting sphere, and catalyst are incorrect, the synthesis is guarrranteed to fail.${prompt}
  9272: And if it fails, you will lose the crystal, crafting sphere, and catalyst you used.${prompt}
  9273: 'Additionally, you will also lose some of the spirit stored within your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  9274: That will mean much of your hard work will be for naught, so be especially carrreful when selecting your materials.${prompt}
  9275: I rrrealize this explanation is dragging on a bit, but how's it going? Try to hang in there for just a little bit longer.${prompt}
  9276: Now I want to explain how to obtain the materials you'll rrrequire.${prompt}
  9277: You can get the MC-I-SR0 series catalyst from me, for the rrright price of course...${prompt}
  9278: The cost of manufacturing is rather high for this particular catalyst, so I got an earful from the coalition's accountant after I made it in bulk.${prompt}
  9279: If I don't turn a profit, it will adversely affect our rrresearch budget... So, sorry about that. I hope you understand.${prompt}
  9280: The crafting spheres are a somewhat unique item. You can obtain them by using a special technique that brrreaks down certain items into their individual components.${prompt}
  9281: You'll need to learn the technique before you can prrroceed. This should be everything you need to master it.${prompt}
  9282: Mwahaha. You can have this one frrree of charge.${prompt}
  9283: Now, about the item to be used as a base for the technique...${prompt}
  9284: 'The ${item-singular: 4[2]} and the ${item-singular: 5[2]}...${prompt}'
  9285: 'You should be able to use the ${item-singular: 4[2]} with the ${item-singular: 6[2]}, and the ${item-singular: 5[2]} with the ${item-singular: 7[2]} for the prrrocedure.${prompt}'
  9286: I believe there are more items out there that can be used. The exact number is unknown, but just consider finding them yet another part of the challenge.${prompt}
  9287: You can obtain information from other adventurers, or just keep experrrimenting until you find the answers for yourself.${prompt}
  9288: However, just be careful that you don't lose any valuable items in the process, even if it is in the name of prrrogress.${prompt}
  9289: I have a feeling that the items used to create the spheres contain some common factors. Of course, I have no evidence to back it up...${prompt}
  9290: That concludes my explanation. I imagine crrreating the spheres will keep you busy for some time to come. Good luck.${prompt}
  9291: Ahh... So this is the one I've heard so much aboutaru...${prompt}
  9292: Oh, how long have you been here?${prompt}
  9293: I justaru arrived.${prompt}
  9294: Mwahaha. Yes, I suppose so.${prompt}
  9295: Although, I was not expecting you to be the one to brrring me the synthesis focuser.${prompt}
  9296: I have my reasons-weasons. It needed a few adjustments before delivery. I know you aren't very good at that sort of thing.${prompt}
  9297: Yes, I suppose you're rrright about that. I am much better at seeing the bigger picture.${prompt}
  9298: By the way, were you able to properly explain the instructions to your guestaru?${prompt}
  9299: Of course I was.${prompt}
  9300: Really? You often tend to leave out rather important details-wetails, so I'm sure you understand my concern.${prompt}
  9301: E-enough about that alrrready. If you just got here, does that mean you were in Mhaura?${prompt}
  9302: Mhaura... I hear it's quite a bustling place, so I have some interestaru in it, but as long as she's there, I think I'll pass.${prompt}
  9303: Besides, I had some minor business to attend to. I paid a visitaru to each of the three countries in the Middle Lands.${prompt}
  9304: Of course, I made a pointaru to bring back some souvenirs for everybody in the coalition!${prompt}
  9305: 'Look! I purchased-wurchased ${article} ${item-article: 10[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 11[2]}, along with ${article} ${item-article: 12[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 13[2]}.${prompt}'

  9311: I had better get going or else I won't make it in time to prepare for the nextaru investigation!${prompt}
  9312: Sorry that I'm so busy rightaru now.${prompt}
  9313: Well then, I'll waitaru until I hear from you again!${prompt}
  9314: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 15[2]}... I''m not exactly sure what I''m supposed to do with this prrresent...${prompt}'
  9315: Hm? There's something wrrritten on the back.${prompt}
  9316: What's this!? You've completed the activation!${prompt}
  9317: Yes, everything looks perrrfect. The activation is complete. You did it!${prompt}
  9318: Mwahaha... Would you like to go over the rrrecipe?${prompt}
  9319: I'd like to check the materials before you begin the synthesis, so would you mind showing them to me firrrst?${prompt}
  9320: Mwahaha. Now then, let's review the rrrecipe, shall we?${prompt}
  9321: Mwahaha. Impressive. Are you ready to perrrform the synthesis now?${prompt}
  9322: '...'
  9323: '...'
  9324: Hm? What's the matter? Is something wrrrong?${prompt}
  9325: What's that? You're trrrying to tell me the synthesis won't start!?${prompt}
  9326: I don't get it... What could've gone wrrrong...${prompt}
  9327: I wonder if the rrrecipe was mistaken... I don't see how though...${prompt}
  9328: Perrrhaps you did not sufficiently activate the object? No, that can't be it!${prompt}
  9329: Wait! That rrreminds me...${prompt}
  9330: I'm sorry. There's one more thing you rrrequire. It should be with your guildmaster.${prompt}
  9331: Do you think you could bring it here for me?${prompt}
  9332: (Thanks, Mikolulu. I completely forrrgot about that note.)${prompt}
  9333: (That note... If I had thrown it carrrelessly away without noticing, I wonder what I would have done...)${prompt}
  9334: I'm sorry. My rrrequest was rather pointless. The thing I asked of you is already here.${prompt}
  9335: Here you go. Mwahaha. It's a rrrather exceptional emblem.${prompt}
  9336: Allow me to go over the rrrecipe once more.${prompt}
  9337: Do you have all of the materials? If so, perrrform the synthesis and show me the completed shield.${prompt}
  9338: So, this is what all of the commotion is about...${prompt}
  9339: This is what I have spent all this time purrrsuing...${prompt}
  9340: It's...${prompt}
  9341: It's completed at last!${prompt}
  9342: Mwahaha. I'm sorry to have frrrightened you. However, I was simply unable to contain my excitement. Mwahahaha!${prompt}
  9343: Well, looks like I'll be having to share that with the guildmaster!${prompt}
  9344: Yes... Go and show that shield to your guildmaster.${prompt}
  9345: Mwahaha. Welcome back. I imagine your guildmaster was rrrather pleased, no?${prompt}
  9346: That rrreminds me... I don't think I ever thanked you properly.${prompt}
  9347: With this project, I started out looking for a way to rrrevolutionize the manufacturing process, but I never would've succeeded without your assistance.${prompt}
  9348: Thank you for helping me all this time. And congrrratulations on finally completing the escutcheon.${prompt}
  9349: I hope crrraftsmen across the land will use that shield to create higher quality goods than ever before.${prompt}
