    Nothing right now.${prompt}
  7151: Auction houses can be found in all of Vana'diel's major cities. Here adventurers gather to bid on battle spoils, unwanted items, old armor...almost anything.${prompt}
  7152: Currently, the auction houses in Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno all work independently. Therefore, prices differ from city to city.${prompt}
  7153: Adventurers may use any auction house regardless of nationality.${prompt}
  7154: The first adventurer to bid at or above the asking price will automatically purchase the product.${prompt}
  7155: Once put up for auction, merchandise will remain there for a maximum of thirty weeks Vana'diel time (nine-and-a-half days Earth time).${prompt}
  7156: If merchandise does not sell within this time limit, it will be returned to the seller's current residence.${prompt}
  7157: Transaction fees are proportional to the amount for which an item is put up on auction. The method of calculating this fee is different for single items and stackable items.${prompt}
  7158: A transaction fee is collected when any merchandise is put up for auction. This fee is nonrefundable.${prompt}
  7159: The International Auction House Committee, or IAHC, has declared that a maximum of seven items may be put up for auction at one time.${prompt}
  7160: However, the IAHC has recently removed the limit to how many items one may purchase.${prompt}
  7161: A small amount of time is required before new merchandise appears on our bid list.${prompt}
  7162: Once an item appears on your “Sales Status” list, it may not immediately appear on the bid list. If you do not see your item on the bid list, try looking again at a later time.${prompt}
  7163: If you would like to withdraw an item from an auction, you must travel to the auction house, and select “Stop Sale” from the “Sales Status” menu.${prompt}
  7164: To remove an item from your “Sales Status” list, you must visit an auction counter to acknowledge the sale or return of your merchandise.${prompt}

  7309: |-
    Our records don't seem to mention you. Is this your first time accepting a coalition assignment?
    Then let me take a moment to explain a bit more about what we do.${prompt}
  7310: The six coalitions here in Adoulin each require the help of pioneers in their own way to support the colonization effort. These tasks both directly and indirectly support the colonization effort.${prompt}
  7311: We will, of course, pay appropriate recompense to those completing these assignments. Further, the Twelve Orders will recognize your efforts as you continue to accomplish these goals, and may even provide you with more important duties as you begin to make a name for yourself.${prompt}
  7312: Perhaps more significantly, the influence of each coalition will expand as more pioneers fulfill these obligations, and the Twelve Orders will permit them to expand.${prompt}
  7313: This, in turn, will enable the coalitions to increase the number and quality of the services they provide, thereby enabling them to contribute to the colonization project even more.${prompt}
  7314: Likewise, if one coalition does not receive enough pioneer support, it may shrink in scale, even if it had previously expanded. It is for this reason that we try to make our assignments as lucrative as feasible.${prompt}
  7315: However, we want to ensure that all pioneers are able to contribute equally. As such, the number of coalition assignments that can be undertaken each day is governed by a system comprised of imprimaturs.${prompt}
  7316: 'You will have to part with one imprimatur per job you undertake. Each pioneer may possess up to ${number: 0} of such permits, with additional imprimaturs distributed at set intervals.${prompt}'
  7317: 'In your case, we will render you with a total of ${number: 1} imprimaturs every ${number: 0} hours (Earth time). They will be held for you at assignment desks.${prompt}'
  7318: One benefit of this system is that you are able to contribute at your own pace. You may save up imprimaturs over a period of time and fill many orders at once, or you may instead use them as they come in.${prompt}
  7319: Additionally, you can choose to spend multiple imprimaturs for one task. Predictably, you will receive rewards commensurate with the number of imprimaturs used.${prompt}
  7320: The convenience of pioneers was our foremost priority when establishing this system. You may use all your imprimaturs to support a particular coalition, or you may instead choose to distribute them among several.${prompt}
  7321: You may also cancel an assignment after it has been accepted. Any imprimaturs used will be returned to you--unless this would put you over the maximum amount, in which case they will be destroyed.${prompt}
  7322: 'There is another aspect of the system I have not yet touched on: “coalition referendums.”${prompt}'
  7323: The coalition referendums help determine how a particular coalition is going to expand. Pioneers are able to vote on which direction the coalition should head.${prompt}
  7324: When you complete an assignment, you will be asked to choose which plan the coalition should prioritize.${prompt}
  7325: A coalition's expansion and services are inexorably intertwined, so take ample stock of which services are on offer before casting your ballot.${prompt}
  7326: The expansion process will take approximately one week (Earth time). Note that coalitions that have not received much pioneer contribution will not expand.${prompt}
  7327: I know this is a lot of information to take in, but it is an essential part of your pioneering activities in Ulbuka.${prompt}

    Nothing.${prompt}
  7408: The Pioneers' Coalition contributes to the colonization effort mainly by cultivating uninhabitable territory and preparing the necessary resources to do so.${prompt}
  7409: It would take no stretch of the imagination to say that our coalition is the standard-bearer for the whole movement, what with all the brave young men and women that swell our ranks.${prompt}
  7410: The maester who leads our family of settlers is Lhe Lhangavo from the Order of Karieyh. She's possibly the most passionate of any order leader, and certainly one of the most caring. She's always looking out for her subordinates.${prompt}
  7411: The Peacekeepers' Coalition has the most self-explanatory name I'm sure you've ever heard. We work towards making Adoulin a safer place.${prompt}
  7412: We're composed of only the most dedicated and dutiful individuals--people willing to give their lives to protect this town and its populace.${prompt}
  7413: The great--though often grumpy--Gratzigg is our maester, but despite his sour demeanor, he's the most loyal of anyone in the Twelve Orders. His love for Adoulin has saved it from utter despair more times than I care to remember.${prompt}
  7414: The Couriers' Coalition does its part by transporting supplies to the front lines. We also ensure the integrity of every shipment's cargo.${prompt}
  7415: We're very punctual and really strict about getting our deliveries right. We have the reputation of being uptight because of it, but it's those qualities that keep the pioneering movement going.${prompt}
  7416: Reginald serves as our maester. He may not be the most talkative person you've ever met, but just try to find a more gentlemanly gentleman among the Twelve Orders.${prompt}
  7417: The Scouts' Coalition gathers intelligence from all over the continentaru and analyzes unknown materials to further the colonization movement.${prompt}
  7418: The knowledge our coalition accrues, coupled-woupled with our innate knack for careful archival supervision, makes us indispensable in this era.${prompt}
  7419: Our maestaru, Margret, belongs to the Order of Haverton. Her sheer brilliance-williance makes appetizers out of even the most difficult problems, so it's no wonder that she is seen as one of the greatest minds in Adoulin.${prompt}
  7420: The Inventors' Coalition mainly supportarus pioneers and the colonization of Ulbuka through the development of tools and equipment.${prompt}
  7421: We provide an economic foundation-wation for the city and the pioneering movement by using the materials pioneers bring us to create new foodstuffs that can last an ocean voyage, along with new articles to outfitaru explorers.${prompt}
  7422: Our maester is the one-and-only Amchuchu from the Order of Orvail. Her skills and mind are more renowned than possibly any other maester in Adoulin's history-wistory, making her one of our most talented technicians.${prompt}
  7423: The number one concern for the Mummers' Coalition is pioneer morale.${prompt}
  7424: It may seem like all we do is spout japes and cavort about, but there is a method to our apparent madness. Soothing the spirits of pioneers has a proven economic benefit, so expect to see Mummer-sponsored events for some time to come.${prompt}
  7425: Flaviria from the Order of Thurandaut heads our troupe, and I've never seen anyone who can spin a yarn or tell a joke quite like her. It's obvious that someone with her personality would be loved by both the nobility and common folk.${prompt}

    Land surveys.
    Component analysis.
    Gathering materials.
    Recovering lost articles.
    Behavioral research.
    Morale boosting.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  7444: Head out into the world and gather vital pioneering resources via methods such as mining and logging. Simply purchasing the supplies tells the coalition nothing of your abilities, however, and those who do will receive no remuneration.${prompt}
  7445: It may seem like a thankless job, but the erection of coalition expansions and frontier stations demands constant provisioning, so it is not a task to be taken lightly.${prompt}
  7446: Natural obstacles pop up from time to time, and pioneers are often asked to engage in a bit of bushwhacking to clear them away so the colonization movement can proceed. The only way to be officially recognized for such feats, though, is by participating in Colonization Reives.${prompt}
  7447: The perils are aptly named, for many pioneers have fallen in attempts to rid the land of them. So many, in fact, that Maester Lhangavo was bereft of a few fur clumps for some time worrying over the issue.${prompt}
  7448: Peace in Adoulin is a precarious thing. Fiends could assault the city at any moment, which is why we need to nip this problem in the bud. Join Lair Reives to eliminate their breeding grounds and contribute to the colonization effort.${prompt}
  7449: If only the instinct to rebuild their homes were not so engrained in these hellions, life would be much easier for us. Sadly, you'll need to participate in these reives periodically in order to keep Ulbuka habitable.${prompt}
  7450: While the Peacekeepers' Coalition often makes its rounds in the city itself, these patrols will take you to specific jungle locales for the express purpose of culling unwanted pests. Make sure to slay your quota, though, or you won't receive any recognition for your deeds.${prompt}
  7451: Give Adoulin's population some peace of mind by embarking on these expeditions every so often. Also, rumors about far more terrifying beasts are likely to surface the further we progress into Ulbuka's interior, but as long as you stick to your duties, you should have no reason to fear them.${prompt}
  7452: For these assignments, you'll need to transport provisions to the sites of future frontier stations. You can now use waypoints and still receive commendations, but be prepared to hear stories about “back in my day, we had to walk all the way out and back on our own two feet,” from some wily veterans.${prompt}
  7453: Frontier stations are paramount to sustaining the colonization effort. Tasks of greater magnitude can't even begin without one, so building these structures should always be a priority.${prompt}
  7454: You will sometimes be charged with carrying supplies from specific frontier stations to the Couriers' Coalition.${prompt}
  7455: By supplies, I mean ones obtained in the jungle through pioneering. Yes, acting as a beast of burden may not be the most glamorous duty, but it is a vital one if we're to improve the coalitions and keep Adoulin economically stable.${prompt}
  7456: The most effective way of supporting those risking their lives on the front lines is by supplying designated frontier bivouacs with the necessary provisions. While it may go against previous Couriers' Coalition policy, the use of waypoints is henceforth permitted on this type of assignment.${prompt}
  7457: Truth be told, frontier bivouacs are not as developed as their station counterparts, but they still play an important role in the colonization of the continent. If they don't receive provisions regularly, our supply lines to the stations will wither and die.${prompt}
  7458: Travel to places unknown in search of ergon loci, areas overflowing with natural energy. While some say it's the journey--not the destination--that matters, failing to survey even a single locus will leave you both depleted of energy and empty-handed.${prompt}
  7459: The potency of an ergon tincture is highly dependent upon the strength of the ergon locus from which it's extracted, so a thorough investigation must be made into each location if we're to successfully use this trump card we've created.${prompt}
  7460: Completion of these assignments means providing the Scouts' Coalition--and no others, for they are the only ones to possess the proper facilities--with unique and extraordinary materials from certain territories.${prompt}
  7461: The jungle is teeming with obscure and unfamiliar substances, and from them we hope to derive more powerful and effective materials with which to aid the colonization effort. Science waits for no man, however, and without periodic deliveries of new samples, our research will stagnate.${prompt}
  7462: The proper equipment and tools are instrumental in the colonization movement's progress--and the Inventors' Coalition apparently wants to be the one to corner the market.${prompt}
  7463: While the Inventors' Coalition doesn't particularly care how you obtain what they ask for once you're in the specified location, they are quite picky about the number you obtain and the fact that you can't deliver to anyone else.${prompt}
  7464: Pioneers are an intrepid band of adventurers, but the nature of their trade makes them prone to losing personal effects. Pick up any lost articles in the territory to which you are dispatched and return for a reward along with a pat on the back.${prompt}
  7465: This is probably the least garish service the Mummers' Coalition provides, but it's one for which pioneers throughout Adoulin are eternally grateful.${prompt}
  7466: Though they may not be the friendliest of Ulbuka's inhabitants, that doesn't mean the fiends who populate the continent can't teach us a thing or two. Research designated beasts by personally experiencing their special attacks and report what they taught you...if you live to tell the tale.${prompt}
  7467: The Mummers' Coalition is constantly searching for its muse in all manner of sources, one being the myriad monsters scattered throughout the jungle. Investigating monsters' behavior may be just the inspiration they need to concoct new dances, gags, and events!${prompt}
  7468: The isolation of the frontier can eat at even the most independent of us, which is why it's important to give our pioneers something to cheer about. Head to specified frontier stations and lift the spirits of the workers there! Just remember that if they don't smile, you don't get rewarded.${prompt}
  7469: Dance, sing, shout, or generally make a fool of yourself. It doesn't matter how you do it, as long as you can make them laugh and forget their cares for a few moments.${prompt}
  7470: This coalition is edified as much as possible, and therefore we have no plans to expand.${prompt}

  7855: We're the perfect duo, you and me! Just think of how much I...<cough> the citizens appreciate your help!${prompt}
  7856: Don't go getting lost along the way and having the Twelve Orders step on your toes, okay?${prompt}
  7857: Not another pioneer come to bother me...${prompt}
  7858: You're making the rounds!? Don't tell me that lazy good-for-nothing pawned his job off on you!${prompt}
  7859: |-
    <Sigh> You made your own bed, now lie in it.
    For what it's worth, nothing out of the ordinary here.${prompt}
  7860: Don't go making any trouble for us, or we'll have to turn our swords on you.${prompt}
  7861: Hey, whippersnapper, you preparin' for your trip to the Yahse Hunting Grounds?${prompt}
  7862: |-
    “Not today”? I can barely hear you!
    Oh ho, so you're checking things out here in Eastern Adoulin!${prompt}
  7863: |-
    Everythin' here's shipshape! Hohoho!
    Let me know if you ever want to head to Yahse!${prompt}
  7864: Did something happen? What brings you here?${prompt}
  7865: Making the rounds? That idiot must've sent you, then.${prompt}
  7866: As you can see, everything here is the picture of peace itself. When you've got someone as competent as me, there's no way anything could go wrong.${prompt}
  7867: This is where people in Eastern Adoulin come to relax. If it's not safe here, it's not safe anywhere!${prompt}
  7868: The citizenry offers prayers to Altana and enjoys cups of tea while gazing over the plaza. It's quite a lovely area.${prompt}
  7869: On clear mornings, you can see the newborn sun rising over Castle Adoulin.${prompt}
  7870: Sometimes residents wake up early just to witness the spectacle.${prompt}
  7871: Forgive my ramblings. You have a mission to complete, don't you?${prompt}
  7872: I suppose you have business with Ikhi Askamot, ministerrr of education?${prompt}
  7873: Making the rrrounds tooth and claw, are you?${prompt}
  7874: There's been no suspicious activity in this parrrt of town.${prompt}
  7875: Hmm? The minister?${prompt}
  7876: I'm afrrraid she's not in at the moment. One of the other ministers has their paws on her.${prompt}
  7877: Easterrrn Adoulin is always busy with the ministers coming and going from their residences. You'd be hard-pressed to catch one of them in their homes.${prompt}
  7878: Guarding a minister's mansion may not be very glorrrious, but we take pride in it nonetheless!${prompt}
  7879: Beforrre you lies Castle Adoulin.${prompt}
  7880: Those not here on official business must...oh, you're here making the rrrounds?${prompt}
  7881: The castle is completely securrre, thanks in no small part to us guards.${prompt}
  7882: Let the Peacekeeperrrs know that nothing is amiss here.${prompt}
  7883: Up ahead you can find the docks that lead pioneers like yourself to the residential areas on the outlying islands.${prompt}
  7884: Oh, you are here on patrol? Thank you for checking in. I have nothing out of the ordinary to report.${prompt}
  7885: Our vessels are running on time, and there have been no maritime accidents of late.${prompt}
  7886: The boat leading to the residential area is just beyond this arch and down the stairs.${prompt}
  7887: Hello, and welcome to the Scouts' Coalition, where we prrrovide you with the latest information!${prompt}
  7888: Oh ho? Patrrrols? Everything is in tip-top condition here!${prompt}
  7889: Our surveys of ergon loci and inspection of rrrare goods from Ulbuka are experiencing nothing but smooth sailing!${prompt}
  7890: The Celennia Wexworth Memorial Library, under the purrrvey of our coalition, is also running without a hitch.${prompt}
  7891: Taking some time to snuggle up with a good book is a grrreat way to spend the evening, don't you think?${prompt}
  7892: Hey, pal!${prompt}
  7893: How was it? Eastern Adoulin sure has a lot to offer, don't you think?${prompt}
  7894: Much of the nobility lives in this area. So many movers and shakers that sometimes I just stop in awe...of the injustice!${prompt}
  7895: In part because of this, patrols here are a lot more tiring than in Western Adoulin.${prompt}
  7896: But the West directly borders the jungle, so I think it's high time they stop paying so much attention to those bayld bursars and tighten things up over there instead!${prompt}
  7897: Don't you think?${prompt}
  7898: On my days off I sometimes go around and make sure things are ok, sometimes with the young lads who live in the area.${prompt}
  7899: To be frank, while you were going around here in the East I went down to the West to...you know, check things out.${prompt}
  7900: Seeing all those kids working hard for Adoulin makes me realize that I can't slack off either!${prompt}
  7901: Hey pal--aren't you a pioneer from Jeuno? Haha, I knew you were from the Middle Lands! Me? I'm a trader from Bastok.${prompt}
  7902: I'd been enjoying the high life at this restaurant with all the gil I've made here so far.${prompt}
  7903: Sooo...that's when I decided to try to rent an airship to make my grand return to Bastok!${prompt}
  7904: Because I realized--did I really want to spend all that time in some boat cooped up against piles and piles of cargo crates?${prompt}
  7905: I mean, pioneers like you didn't use conventional means to come here, right? You have those “waypoint” things to rely on.${prompt}
  7906: Good on you. Me, I can't trust that type of new technology! What if I find myself stranded on some desert island because the machine was malfunctioning!? Yeah, no fun. So I sold my geomagnetron.${prompt}
  7907: <Sigh> But now, when I think of the long days and nights I'll have to spend to get back...${prompt}
  7908: I'm getting seasick just thinking about it.${prompt}
  7909: That being the case, I've decided to realize my dream of going back on an airship.${prompt}
  7910: Adoulin uses airships, too, but only for shipping purposes. I've heard that they have no passenger services whatsoever.${prompt}
  7911: I kept pressing the lady at the desk for an answer, but she glared at me like I'd just eaten her firstborn child.${prompt}
  7912: And that's where you come in. I want you to head over to the airship docks located on the north side of Western Adoulin and find out why they won't let me use their airships for travel.${prompt}
  7913: Go check with the lady at the desk. She'll probably tell you why they don't provide airship travel services.${prompt}
  7914: My friend, you're back! Did you find anything out?${prompt}
  7915: Oh...so it has to do with propeller malfunctioning.${prompt}
  7916: Do you suppose they'll reconsider if a safer way is found? Or are they using this as an excuse?${prompt}
  7917: I suppose it doesn't matter. I'll stay here in Adoulin for a little while longer. Thanks for checking it out for me, though!${prompt}
  7918: You must be one of those pioneers I keep hearing about.${prompt}
  7919: You heard of the Rala Waterways, located beneath the areas surrounding the castle?${prompt}
  7920: It's like a goddamn maze down there. Good luck finding a reliable way in.${prompt}
  7921: There are gates located throughout, but which ones are open changes depending on the day.${prompt}
  7922: Don't think you can learn one way in and be set for life. It's not that easy.${prompt}
  7923: I want you to check the gates' operations and help keep the area safe.${prompt}
  7924: Go speak to the soldier located near the holy battlegrounds, an area of the Waterways located beneath locales leading to Big Bridge.${prompt}
  7925: If you can do this simple task, then I'll recognize you as a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] of mettle.${prompt}
  7926: Forgot how to get there already? You're looking for a soldier located in the holy battlegrounds area of the Waterways, located in areas beneath Big Bridge.${prompt}
  7927: How are you progressing?${prompt}
  7928: Everything checks out, then?${prompt}
  7929: If you managed to get that far, then you've succeeded in navigating that area without getting lost. Good work.${prompt}
  7930: With all the foul creatures sprouting like weeds down there, we've had trouble ensuring the gates are functioning properly of late.${prompt}
  7931: Any help you can give in keeping the area safe would be most welcome.${prompt}
  7932: I'll share a secret with you. The Waterways also serve as an emergency exit of sorts.${prompt}
  7933: I find it quite helpful that more pioneers are beginning to learn about the area. If anything happens, the lot of you can assist us in case of evacuation.${prompt}
  7934: There can never be too many people willing to lend us a hand.${prompt}
  7935: Leave your pride at the door and strive to be the best pioneer you can. Adoulin is counting on you.${prompt}
  7936: That's all for today.${prompt}
  7937: This slope sure is steep!${prompt}
  7938: I asked grandpa why they made it. He said it was to protect the castle.${prompt}
  7939: He also said that some guy used to spend time running up and down.${prompt}
  7940: He ran so much they named it after him! I forgot what grandpa said his name was.${prompt}
  7941: Want me to run up this slope to show you how big it is? Here I go!${prompt}
  7942: <Huff> <puff> I...can...barely...breathe...!${prompt}
  7943: There's no way I can make a second go at it! Mom was right when she said kids shouldn't play on it!${prompt}
  7944: Whose idea was it to make this stupid thing, anyway!? Not like I'll ever go to the castle, but still!${prompt}

  7956: If you change your mind, you know where to findy-wind me. Not like I've anywhere better to go.${prompt}
  7957: Like most pioneers, you must be aware that this is called a...a “waypointaru.”${prompt}
  7958: It enables you to warp to differentaru locations. Obviously.${prompt}
  7959: 'But without ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} attuned to the area, you cannot use them. <Zzz>${prompt}'

  7962: Here...start with this one right nextaru to us. Ohhh...my head. How many of you do I have to explain this to?${prompt}
  7963: Now you have recorded the data-wata in this waypoint. Congratulations on your <yawn> momentous accomplishment.${prompt}
  7964: Oh...you've already recorded the data here. Nice work. Bet that took a lot of effort. <Snort>${prompt}
  7965: A small amount of kinetic units will let you use waypoints as much as you want...but only if you've recorded the data from them first. Phew, is it really hotaru out here, or is it me?${prompt}
  7966: So get out there and start recording! No, seriously, leave.${prompt}
  7967: You want to...know where the others are? I swear, some adventurers want everything handed to them on a silver plattaru.${prompt}
  7968: One is straight to the east of here, in the plaza where the statue-watue of Altana stands. You do know who Altana is, right? Or do I need to give a theology lesson, too?${prompt}
  7969: One is rightaru to the south, in front of the Scouts' Coalition. Why don't you go ask them for information, instead of standing here bothering me?${prompt}
  7970: One is to the north near the wharf that leady-weads to the Yahse Hunting Grounds. That's right, the wharf. You know, where the boatarus dock?${prompt}
  7971: One is a bit to the south, deep within the alleyways, where your Rent-a-Room is. Yes, that place you go tumbling-wumbling back to at night after “protecting us from villainous creatarus.”${prompt}
  7972: From the southwestern part of the plaza head south and then east, in frontaru of the auction house. You know what I wish they sold at the auction house? Better jobs.${prompt}
  7973: East from the plaza, on Sverdhried Hillock, which leads to Adoulin Castle. A “hillock” is a big slopey-wope. It would be a shame if you were to, say...sprain your ankle on the way up.${prompt}
  7974: And one up past the hillock...at the entrance-wentrance to Coronal Esplanade. Did you realize that “esplanade” is just a fancy-wancy name for “walkway”?${prompt}
  7975: And more...one beyond there, in front of the gate to Adoulin Castle. Castle. You know, big thing? Nobility lives there, etc., etc.?${prompt}
  7976: Far be it from a simple laytaru like me to dictate the rules of engagementaru, but start from the top and work your way down. It'll be easier.${prompt}
  7977: You've recorded all the data...congratulations. This will surely go down in the annals of history-wistory.${prompt}
  7978: Maybe I shouldn't be so harshy-warsh. Here's your reward. Take it before I change my mind.${prompt}
  7979: How are you finding the waypointarus? You'd better not have made me go through all that explanation for nothing!${prompt}
  7980: ${choice-player-gender}[Mr./Ms.] pioneer, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am]! I need your helpy-welp!${prompt}

  7983: 'It pains me to ask for your aid, but could you use this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and take a looky-wook at her for me?${prompt}'

  7985: 'Use the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to scrutinize-wutinize them for me. You owe me that much.${prompt}'

  7989: <Grumble> Guess that means I gotta give you something-womething, doesn't it?${prompt}
  7990: Here. Just don't tell anyone I gave it to you, or they'll all come running to “assistaru me” and bleed me dry.${prompt}
  7991: Yes, yes, you checked Meg out, but there are other waypointarus who also need your help!${prompt}
  7992: |-
    Hm? Whaddya want?
    Oh, you're the one who helped my boy. Getting rid of those monsters was a big help.${prompt}
  7993: He's always been such a worrywart, but I'll tell you--when he told me his most recent stories, the hair on the back of my neck started to stand up. Mind if I get this off my chest?${prompt}

    No, thank you.${prompt}
  7995: Well, if you ever have a free moment, I'm always willing to share.${prompt}
  7996: Just past here are the Yahse Hunting Grounds. Since you're not from around here, you might not've heard the tales told about the Velkk there.${prompt}
  7997: Ferocious savages, I tell you. Doesn't matter who you are or how big of a weapon you've got. If you come near them, you'll be met with nothing but violence.${prompt}
  7998: 'But a pioneer like you--you could match them ponz for ponz. Can you head to Yahse and get me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}?${prompt}'
  7999: That'll show me you gave those savages a good beating and help me sleep better at night.${prompt}

  8001: Hey there. Managed to kill a bunch of filthy Velkk scum, did you? I'd expect no less of a pioneer.${prompt}
  8002: I'll be able to breathe a bit easier now. Here--a token of my appreciation.${prompt}
  8003: |-
    Hey! My favorite pioneer!
    My pal, my friend, my buddy!
    You know what best buds do? They kill more Velkk to make their friends feel safer!${prompt}
  8004: 'Not that I''m, um <gulp> scared. Just, you know--can never be too careful. Why don''t you go knock some skulls and bring me back some more ${item-plural: 0[2]} or ${item-plural: 1[2]} from the Velkk?${prompt}'
  8005: Just talk to that guy at the counter to head back to the Yahse Hunting Grounds.${prompt}

  8009: Times are rough for my family. My son keeps going on about some “enveloping darkness” and my husband is scared to death of monsters in the Yahse Hunting Grounds.${prompt}
  8010: Now all their worrying has gotten to me! My once-pristine forehead is covered in wrinkles from furrowing my brow!${prompt}
  8011: The Yahse Hunting Grounds are barely a stone's throw away. People talk about shadowy fiends down there, and I'm stricken with fear!${prompt}
  8012: Will the Peacekeepers' Coalition be able to keep us safe? Sometimes I wonder.${prompt}
  8013: So that's why I was hoping to find a ${choice-player-gender}[strapping/strong] pioneer like yourself to help me out with this problem.${prompt}
  8014: 'Take the law into your own hands. Defeat some of those nasties down in the Yahse Hunting Grounds and bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  8015: If the rumors about your type are true, then it should be easy!${prompt}
  8016: I'm so glad you were able to make good on your promise when so many before you did not.${prompt}
  8017: I can sleep well at night knowing my home is a bit safer. Here--this is for you.${prompt}
  8018: Why, hello again! You know, my hubby is still telling those wild stories of his, and his fear is starting to rub off on me all over again.${prompt}
  8019: 'Can you head down to Yahse Hunting Grounds again and bring me some ${item-plural: 0[2]}? I''ll make if worth your while, just like before.${prompt}'

  8024: |-
    Really? Well...
    We're having trouble getting supplies in from the Couriers' Coalition.${prompt}
  8025: To be frank, I used to work for them, but...with all their resources being poured into pioneering, they can't spare much--even with my connections.${prompt}

  8041: Remember those waypointarus you helped me with before? Well, they're fine, but now it's the ones outside the city that are giving me trouble-wouble.${prompt}
  8042: My precious little ones, always doing what's rightaru for the populace. Unlike some people.${prompt}
  8043: I need you to look after the ones in Jeuno and the frontier-wontier stations. And how dare you patronize me for caring about my babies! They've helped more people than you have, and that's a factaru.${prompt}
  8044: Poor little Chapi, floating out there all alone in a foreign land...${prompt}
  8045: The energies in the Middle Lands are weaker than those here, though someone lacking in astutaruness like yourself probably can't tell. That makes it hard to fix them.${prompt}
  8046: My sweet proto-wotos are designed specifically for your backwards homeland, so they should be fine, at least.${prompt}

  8358: Accounts of how you bested the Naakuals could never remain mere whispers amongst the citizenry.${prompt}

  8363: Did you know that a whole century has passed since the Sacred City of Adoulin was established?${prompt}
  8364: While that may be an obvious fact, a lesser known piece of trivia is that the population of Adoulin's archipelago has more than doubled in the past decade.${prompt}
  8365: This growth shows no signs of stagnating, either.${prompt}
  8366: The obvious outcome of this population explosion is that the demand placed on our food supply--as well as our insufficient housing--increases dramatically.${prompt}

    “Tread not upon the hinterland of Ulbuka.”${prompt}

  8377: To blatantly ignore it would do nothing but invite divine retribution. Isn't that right, Vortimere?${prompt}
  8378: Th-that may be true, Gratzigg.${prompt}
  8379: B-but Grand Chancellor Ygnas is Adras's descendant, and it is he who p-p-patrons the colonization movement.${prompt}
  8380: Do my eyes d-d-deceive me, or has Mr. Adoulin...yet to grace us with his presence?${prompt}
  8381: Grand Chancellor Ygnas has a bout of illness, so I have been told.${prompt}
  8382: |-
    Oh, my...
    This...this does not b-b-bode well. Not in the least.${prompt}
  8383: He convinced us all to disregard the founder's will...and now he is unable to even stand before us and d-d-defend his position...${prompt}
  8384: |-
    How can the mastermind behind this sacrilege worm his way out of all culpability?
    To hell with this farce!${prompt}
  8385: Your anger is m-m-more than understandable, Gratzigg...but there is little we can do if the chancellor is ill.${prompt}
  8386: It is an unfortunate t-t-turn of events, but one we must accept.${prompt}
  8387: Turn of events, my tail!${prompt}
  8388: He's probably locked himself away in his ivory tower, sniveling into his pillow and quivering at the grave mistake he's made!${prompt}
  8389: That's quite the venomous-wenemous statement, Gratzigg.${prompt}
  8390: |-
    So it is, and I stand by every word of it.
    And you, Chero-Machero!? Your hands are just as sullied!${prompt}

  8397: |-
    If you truly want to get rich quick, then you've got to go through his servant first.
    Try asking him about the chancellor's constitution. I hear Ygnas isn't well enough to attend his own meetings, but suuurely he'll grant an audience to some nomad he's never met before.${prompt}
  8398: It seems...the g-g-grand chancellor...is feeling...under the weather...${prompt}

    Damn your idiotic euphemisms!
    “Under the weather”!?${prompt}
  8400: What the hell is that supposed to mean!? Exactly how's he “under the weather”!?${prompt}
  8401: I see apothecaries and priests here. Have any of them tended to the chancellor's supposed bout of illness?${prompt}
  8402: Well...um...errr...${prompt}
  8403: Arciela V. Adoulin, daughter of the former royal family and sister to Grand Chancellor Ygnas, has entered the hall!${prompt}
  8404: I'm terribly sorry to have kept you all waiting.${prompt}
  8405: Again, let me apologize for my tardiness.${prompt}
  8406: N-no need...Miss Arciela.${prompt}
  8407: It seems my brother has worked himself sick over the issue of colonization.${prompt}

  8410: Yes, we are both well aware of what has transpired.${prompt}

  8415: Yet she certainly enters them often enough!${prompt}
  8416: Or that is what an astute detractor might argue, anyway.${prompt}
  8417: The Twelve Orders of Adoulin were created equal...but some more equal than others. I suppose that is bound to happen when the members of one all have the founder king's blood coursing through their royal veins.${prompt}

  8427: No? Ohhh, that's what I was afraid of. She must have put on her traveling clothes and headed off into the forest...${prompt}
  8428: She had been muttering something about strange goings-on at an ergon locus in the Cirdas Caverns.${prompt}
  8429: I-I mean... Oh dear, you're not supposed to know that! I didn't tell you anything, and no one can prove that I did!${prompt}
  8430: Sweet mercy! This is not a good day for me at all...
  8431: What do you want? My time is too precious to waste with a common whelp.${prompt}
  8432: Maester Gratzigg, this ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] is an adventurer from the Middle Lands--a pioneer.${prompt}
  8433: Yes, now that I look closer, I remember your face.${prompt}
  8434: It is because of fools like yourself that the sacred forests have been violated after centuries of peace!${prompt}
  8435: Bah. Mincing words with a barbaric outsider is a waste of time. I shall go myself.${prompt}
  8436: But, Maester!${prompt}
  8437: And I suppose you have a better idea for remedying this calamity? This is a matter of pride for both orders.${prompt}
  8438: Don't just stand there--follow me!${prompt}
  8439: You're a pioneer? Then you must be interested in what this whole mess is about.${prompt}
  8440: Well, obviously a fight has broken out--in the middle of the city. Surely you're aware of the struggles between those in favor of colonization and those opposed.${prompt}
  8441: Some young upstart from the Order of Renaye and a lunkhead from the Inventors' Coalition have come to blows.${prompt}
  8442: And since neither is backing down, the situation is just getting worse.${prompt}
  8443: The two are strict adherents to their orders, so any fight between them is a fight between the orders themselves.${prompt}
  8444: I bet you're just itching to stick your nose where it doesn't belong. Hmph. No skin off my back, but Gratzigg has likely put everything to rest already.${prompt}
  8445: And by “put to rest,” I mean moved the squabble down to the coliseum.${prompt}
  8446: |-
    Inquire further?
    ${selection-lines}
    “Coliseum”?${prompt}
  8447: How can you spend so much time in Adoulin and be completely oblivious to the famed Watergarden Coliseum in Rala Waterways? It's a place where pride is won and lost.${prompt}
  8448: Since anyone can remember, the place has been used to settle disputes and feuds...sometimes even at the cost of precious lives.${prompt}
  8449: But it isn't a place for barbarism. Strict rules have been put in place to keep all fights fair.${prompt}
  8450: That has kept the deaths to the minimum--but that doesn't mean some poeple don't come out with their tails between their legs.${prompt}
  8451: But there's no point in heading down there. They don't just let any riffraff in to watch the fights.${prompt}
  8452: The Peacekeepers' Coalition has better things to do than keep an eye on any fool who wants to watch blood be shed.${prompt}
  8453: So don't think for one second that the guards will let you pass its gates.${prompt}
  8454: Ugh, can't a guy go one day without someone causing trouble?${prompt}
  8455: You overheard some scary figures muttering furtively in the Rala Waterways?${prompt}
  8456: |-
    Hmmm...
    “H-G-something-I,” you say?${prompt}
  8457: My guess is that they are the initials of the individuals who lead orders in opposition to the colonization movement.${prompt}
  8458: So, that would be...wait, don't tell me...${prompt}
  8459: |-
    Hildebert, the minister of judication...
    Gratzigg, from the Peacekeepers' Coalition...
    Svenja, the minister of public affairs...${prompt}
  8460: '...and Ikhi Askamot, the minister of education.${prompt}'
  8461: That actually makes a lot of sense.${prompt}
  8462: You are more than welcome.${prompt}
  8463: If you were missing “Svenja”...${prompt}
  8464: That means the whole thing is “HGSI”!${prompt}
  8465: According to my theory, at least.${prompt}
  8466: If your theory's wrong, at least we'll know who to blame.${prompt}
  8467: How about you blame yourself for failing to come up with any of your own ideas?${prompt}
  8468: |-
    Alright, you got me.
    Let's just get back to work, okay? The mountain of paperwork we've got on our hands isn't going to disappear by itself.${prompt}
  8469: That is the first good point you have made all day.${prompt}
  8470: What business have you at this hour?${prompt}
  8471: |-
    ...Ah, I knew I recognized you.
    You're ${name-player}, the pioneer invited to the dinner here some time ago.${prompt}
  8472: |-
    Please pardon my temporary lapse in memory.
    Sadly, I am under strict orders not to let anyone into the castle this late at night.${prompt}
  8473: |-
    What?
    A plot by anti-colonization revolutionaries, you say?${prompt}
  8474: |-
    I'm afraid that isn't my jurisdiction.
    You'll have to inform the Peacekeepers' Coalition, as they are much more prepared than I to deal with something of this scope.${prompt}
  8475: Come to think of it, I remember Grennith mentioning a problem with the kitchen. I hardly think that has anything to do with a conspiracy, though.${prompt}
  8476: |-
    What was it?
    Oh, just that they had yet to receive their weekly stock of ingredients from the Civic Arboretum.${prompt}
  8477: |-
    ${name-player}...
    Why bring someone of such questionable moral character to this assembly?${prompt}
  8478: The Order of Adoulin remains yet the leader of our alliance, with a strong lineage tracing back to the founder king.${prompt}
  8479: Why would you summon a mere commoner--and one from a foreign land, at that!?${prompt}
  8480: You seem to have won over the hearts of the nobility, hmm?${prompt}
  8481: Take a brief moment to listen away from their eyes.${prompt}
  8482: Hildebert, there is no reason to work yourself into a tizzy.${prompt}
  8483: 'You are well aware that we attempted to use ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, which ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] received from the queen of the leafkin.${prompt}'
  8484: And in the end, none of us were able to communicate with Ygnas.${prompt}
  8485: No, ${name-player} was the only one to do so...${prompt}
  8486: Hmph. Dear Svenja, you let yourself be taken in by this mockery of our orders. What proof have you that ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] wasn't just spouting drivel to serve ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] own ends?${prompt}
  8487: ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] certainly did not seem to be lying to me.${prompt}
  8488: No, ${name-player} seemed like a young ${choice-player-gender}[man/lady] who chooses the path of enlightenment rather than willful ignorance.${prompt}
  8489: No, ${name-player} seemed like a young ${choice-player-gender}[man/lady] who is not constrained by selfish pride, but rather has the courage to know when to listen.${prompt}
  8490: No, ${name-player} seemed like a young ${choice-player-gender}[man/lady] of great poise despite ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] small stature.${prompt}
  8491: No, ${name-player} seemed like a young lady filled with self-control who doesn't give in to flippant desires.${prompt}
  8492: No, ${name-player} seemed like a man filled with both the vigor of youth and the wisdom of age.${prompt}
  8493: Oh ho, my dear Svenja, you seem to have quite the opinion of our enigmatic friend.${prompt}
  8494: 'But darkness of the heart oft lies well hid. Are you sure trusting one such as ${choice: 0}[she/he] is prudent?${prompt}'
  8495: 'Not to say, of course, that I disbelieve ${choice: 0}[her/him].${prompt}'
  8496: No, it is through ${name-player} that we learn about Ygnas's condition, as well as the Middle Lands themselves.${prompt}
  8497: |-
    Their armies, politics, economy...
    We cannot sit forever on this little island, playing fifth fiddle to the rest of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  8498: On that, I daresay, you are mistaken.${prompt}
  8499: Oh? About what?${prompt}
  8500: I do not wish to speak ill of ${name-player}, but...${prompt}
  8501: The situation is not so simple.${prompt}
  8502: Lest you forget, Arciela was also able to hear Ygnas's voice.${prompt}
  8503: W-well I--${prompt}
  8504: And yet she chose to leave ${name-player} with that which Rosulatia bequeathed.${prompt}
  8505: “Rosulatia gave it to ${name-player}, not to me.”${prompt}
  8506: |-
    Hildebert, Melvien.
    My trust in ${name-player} is not mere whimsy.${prompt}
  8507: If Arciela believes in ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], then so shall I.${prompt}
  8508: Sometimes I stop and catch myself pondering what this all means.${prompt}
  8509: What if...what if all this were a challenge posed to us by the founder king?${prompt}
  8510: In the countless years since his passing, how has Adoulin changed and evolved?${prompt}
  8511: That one of his bloodline should be transformed into a lesser being right as colonization recommenced...we may be struggling against a current stronger than ourselves.${prompt}
  8512: That is why I wonder if we are being tested.${prompt}
  8513: Tested? By whom?${prompt}
  8514: I do not know.${prompt}
  8515: Perhaps...by fate itself.${prompt}
  8516: Well, my sarcasm comes back to haunt me. You appear to have some allies within these walls.${prompt}
  8517: The real trial will come right as we pass through these doors.${prompt}
  8518: I've heard all I need to. Let us see how useful you really are.${prompt}
  8519: I have returned from the Middle Lands--and it appears everyone is already assembled.${prompt}
  8520: Dispense with the pleasantries. Show me to Ygnas.${prompt}
  8521: Far be it from me to doubt one of my own order...but how much can you tell from such a simple gesture?${prompt}
  8522: I must confess my surprise at your doubt. I speak only as the Goddess guides me. Tell me, do you doubt Her wisdom?${prompt}
  8523: Forgive me if my words seem brazen, Hildebert.${prompt}
  8524: Back to the matter at hand...what has befallen Ygnas is most certainly some form of curse.${prompt}
  8525: Then it is as we suspected.${prompt}
  8526: Indeed. And though this is no ordinary curse, I am inclined to believe that it is not borne from the founder king.${prompt}
  8527: (She's...)${prompt}
  8528: (...wro...)${prompt}
  8529: (B...but...I cannot...put...words.)${prompt}
  8530: (${name-player}...)${prompt}
  8531: |-
    (You....talk to...me...now...
    ...may not...able...longer.)${prompt}
  8532: Yes, adventurer? Has Ygnas spoken to you?${prompt}
  8533: You say this is, in fact, the curse of the founder king? And what basis have you for contradicting me?${prompt}
  8534: S-so it is...after all.${prompt}
  8535: How your mind changes on every whim, like a leaf upon the breeze. Not five minutes ago you were singing a different tune.${prompt}
  8536: You were s-spying on us from outside the door!?${prompt}
  8537: Hmph. I never took you for one who only hears what he wants to.${prompt}
  8538: That is not the case at all, just...${prompt}
  8539: |-
    What do you say?
    ${selection-lines}
    There's no need to break the curse.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  8540: Silence, outsider. You have no place interjecting your opinions into this dialogue. Your only job is to tell us what he is saying.${prompt}
  8541: It matters not who placed this curse upon Ygnas.${prompt}
  8542: Only a grand ritual of purging will be able to rid such a terrible affliction, but unfortunately...${prompt}
  8543: Unfortunately what, Ingrid?${prompt}
  8544: Such a purgation requires materials that I do not have on hand.${prompt}
  8545: Vana'diel only exists thanks to the blessings of eight crystals. To penetrate darkness, we need a vessel wrapped in the power of the seven other types.${prompt}
  8546: I have on hand thunder, ice, and light...and would ask you to procure earth, water, fire, and wind for me.${prompt}
  8547: And what exactly would suffice?${prompt}
  8548: They must be things bathed in a holy glow...let me think...${prompt}
  8549: Yes...a piece of stone wall touched by the light of dawn.${prompt}
  8550: Holy water untainted by impurity.${prompt}
  8551: A flame that has gone unextinguished for seven years.${prompt}
  8552: The wings of a weather vane that has stood the test of time.${prompt}
  8553: I require each of those four things.${prompt}
  8554: And of course, we have someone who is more than willing to serve as our errand ${choice-player-gender}[boy/girl].${prompt}
  8555: Is that not right, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  8556: Return here once you have the appropriate items, and I will begin the ritual.${prompt}
  8557: Until that time, I shall make preparations.${prompt}
  8558: That girl has some nerve.${prompt}
  8559: ${name-player}, I would ask you to look after Arciela.${prompt}
  8560: |-
    “Why?”
    I need not tell you that she always runs headfirst into danger.${prompt}
  8561: ${name-player}! It is good to see you here.${prompt}
  8562: I came as soon as I heard that Ingrid was to examine my brother.${prompt}
  8563: But since everyone has already left...how did the ritual go?${prompt}
  8564: |-
    What will you say to her?
    ${selection-lines}
    Tell her about the curse and purging.
    Tell her that Ygnas's voice faltered.
    ...Arciela?${prompt}
  8565: They're going to perform a purging ritual?${prompt}
  8566: I see. So Ingrid feels it is a curse after all...but not the founder king's...${prompt}
  8567: What!?${prompt}
  8568: What could it mean that his voice faltered...?${prompt}
  8569: My brother began to show symptoms right as the call went out for adventurers from the Middle Lands.${prompt}
  8570: It started out as a simple rash. He said it might have been something he picked up in the forest...${prompt}
  8571: He was still of human form, talking with me just as he had when we were younger...I can still hear his voice...${prompt}
  8572: And then slowly he turned into what you see him as today, eventually losing all powers of speech.${prompt}
  8573: And to think, even though you were able to communicate with him telepathically, now...${prompt}
  8574: Does that mean the curse is still progressing? That this isn't the end?${prompt}
  8575: Might he turn into a leafkin for good?${prompt}
  8576: |-
    You are too kind to me.
    And you're right. It would not do for me to sit here and stew.${prompt}
  8577: If you're going to help find the materials needed for this purging...${prompt}
  8578: '...Then let me come with you. I''d do anything to see my brother whole again.${prompt}'
  8579: Just let me know whatever you need.${prompt}
  8580: Ingrrrid herself has left me with a message for you.${prompt}
  8581: You are to gather four items that have been touched by the Divine.${prompt}
  8582: |-
    The firrrst, a piece of stone wall touched by the light of dawn.
    The second, holy water untainted by impurity.${prompt}
  8583: |-
    The thirrrd, a flame that has gone unextinguished for seven years.
    The fourth, the wings of a weather vane that has stood the test of time.${prompt}
  8584: Perhaps you could start by gathering information from the other exorcists. They would do their utmost to uphold Ingrid's wishes.${prompt}
  8585: Hildebert's manse is not far from here. I suggest you pay his order a visit and see what information you can glean.${prompt}
  8586: Ah yes, my dear adventurer. Come. We have been expecting you.${prompt}
  8587: Vortimere himself has bid me hold on to something for you.${prompt}
  8588: 'Here. This ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  8589: This flame was bequeathed unto us by Moh Rihimi, a geomancer who lived many ages ago.${prompt}
  8590: No evil force may come within several yalms of its blessed heat, and thus it has burned brightly without fail for years.${prompt}
  8591: I can tell the fact that exorcists and geomancers once worked together confounds you.${prompt}
  8592: We exorcists answer to a divine providence, yet do not define everything in black-and-white terms.${prompt}
  8593: I have some inforrrmation for you on the other vessels which Ingrid bid you acquire.${prompt}
  8594: Our research suggests that the “stone wall touched by the light of dawn” has something to do with Adoulin's porrrt district.${prompt}
  8595: Sailors and captains of our fair city have a custom of honorrring the morning sun, and as such many of our vessels contain the word “dawn” in their names.${prompt}
  8596: And as for the “holy water untainted by impurity,” we believe it to be located in the fountain in Western Adoulin's plaza.${prompt}
  8597: The fountain's water is taken directly from the Rala Waterways underneath Adoulin proper, so it is both pure and clean.${prompt}
  8598: Unforrrtunately we are at a loss as to where the “wings of a weather vane that has stood the test of time” might be.${prompt}
  8599: However, we have contacted the scouts to gather intelligence. I suggest that you first head to the fountain to begin your search.${prompt}
  8600: The “holy water untainted by impurity” unquestionably refers to the water of Western Adoulin's fountain.${prompt}
  8601: We have also enlisted the aid of some scouts to help us investigate furrrther. Head first to the fountain to get the water, or find the stone in question.${prompt}
  8602: My dearrr pioneer, we have located the weather vane that you seek.${prompt}
  8603: To the south of this very plaza lies a larrrge manse whose storage unit contains such an object.${prompt}
  8604: We have already discussed the issue with the owners, who are waiting for your arrrival at the manse to the south.${prompt}
  8605: Well, what have we here? You must be the pioneer after that weather vane.${prompt}
  8606: Me? The owner? Surely you jest--I'm just the hired help. But I do indeed have what you seek.${prompt}
  8607: One of the older groundskeepers told me this piece has quite the history behind it. But it's seen better days, and has remained in storage for as long as I've been here.${prompt}
  8608: Back many years ago, the northern wind blew toward Adoulin for the first time in centuries, carrying upon it a ravaging plague. This vane alerted the citizenry to its coming.${prompt}
  8609: Of course, we now have remedies to combat such a disease, and this ol' thing has seen better days, so... Well, I needn't state the obvious.${prompt}
  8610: Needless to say, no one could bear to part with something that saved so many lives.${prompt}
  8611: That's why it's been buried away here for so long. Make sure you treat it well, 'hear?${prompt}
  8612: Promise me you won't drop it on your way? My master would never forgive me.${prompt}
  8613: You actually made it back in a reasonable time frame. I must admit to being mildly impressed.${prompt}
  8614: Not that this puts you in my good graces, but Ingrid the Merciless knows to give credit where credit is due, adventurer from the Middle Lands.${prompt}
  8615: Now that all my implements are here, there is naught to do but perform the purgation.${prompt}
  8616: I-imposs...${prompt}
  8617: I had hoped that...${prompt}
  8618: It is as we feared. Such a strong curse could only be the work of the founder king.${prompt}
  8619: Do you all believe me now? This self-absorbed girl could not dispel the darkness around Ygnas. The founder king's will has spoken!${prompt}
  8620: Urk!${prompt}
  8621: I cannot deny the intensity of this affliction. Perhaps my confidence got the better of me--this requires an even more elaborate ritual.${prompt}
  8622: I must depart to ponder this further--but I'll be ready next time!${prompt}
  8623: So you f-f-failed...${prompt}
  8624: I must apologize for my inadequacy, Lord Vortimere.${prompt}
  8625: N-n-no, my dear. You need not be sorry.${prompt}
  8626: But...why?${prompt}
  8627: This is the p-p-perfect opportunity, Ingrid. The more rituals we conduct, the more our influence grows.${prompt}
  8628: But do not fail again. Should our authority come into qu-qu-question, all we have done will have been for naught.${prompt}
  8629: Fear not, Lord Vortimere. I have no intention of losing face twice.${prompt}
  8630: Our c-c-calling as exorcists is to rid Adoulin of forces most fiendish and foul.${prompt}
  8631: And this is a task that must be entrusted to us, and n-n-no other.${prompt}
  8632: Just think back, to the time of the G-G-Great Expedition. How valued were we then! And how valued we will be again!${prompt}
  8633: C-c-colonization must continue...and yet there are many that would see it falter.${prompt}
  8634: Ikhi Askamot dares not open her mouth, owing to the r-r-recent events at the coliseum, but too many of the other leaders remain hard-headed.${prompt}
  8635: Ingrid, a question.${prompt}
  8636: Of course.${prompt}
  8637: You saw the g-g-grand chancellor up close. Were you able to...?${prompt}
  8638: No. I did not have the opportunity.${prompt}
  8639: I thought you of all p-p-people would have been able to understand.${prompt}
  8640: I had suspected they would blather on about the founder king's curse, but this...${prompt}
  8641: Pay it no further attention. We have more p-p-pressing matters to attend to.${prompt}
  8642: I had n-n-not expected that girl to turn out to be such a threat.${prompt}
  8643: It matters not whether she is telling the truth or l-l-lying about being able to hear Ygnas's voice, but no matter. Her getting in our way is inevitable.${prompt}
  8644: ${name-player}, whatever shall we do?${prompt}
  8645: (Don't break...the...curse...)${prompt}
  8646: (...hfff...)${prompt}
  8647: (I can feel it...ness.)${prompt}
  8648: (Something dread...ing this way.)${prompt}
  8649: ${name-player}...is my brother saying something?${prompt}
  8650: (The key...right there...lead you...)${prompt}
  8651: (.........)${prompt}
  8652: (......)${prompt}
  8653: (...)${prompt}
  8654: 'The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} begins to fade, taking Ygnas''s voice along with it!${prompt}'
  8655: ${name-player}, tell me! What did my brother say? He was pointing right at me!${prompt}
  8656: A key...to lead us? What could he have meant?${prompt}
  8657: Why, my dear, do you not see? The answer is in front of you, plain as day.${prompt}
  8658: Arciela, you never desired colonization. By pointing at you, he meant that we should follow your true desires.${prompt}
  8659: It can only mean that we must respect the will of the founder king, and that it would be a grave mistake to pursue colonization any further!${prompt}
  8660: But, no! I...I...
  8661: A clever trick, Hildebert. But pray tell me--is that the only explanation?${prompt}
  8662: Could it not mean that Ygnas wishes Arciela to continue colonization in his stead?${prompt}
  8663: He may be wishing for her to become the standard-bearer of colonization.${prompt}
  8664: Your insolence goes too far this time, Melvien!${prompt}
  8665: Insolence? No. I have used only the most deductive of reasoning.${prompt}
  8666: Countless hours have I spent poring over tomes and annals dating back to our very first colonization efforts.${prompt}
  8667: You impudent fool! Who are you to look down on the founder king's dying words?${prompt}
  8668: The lesson that the Great Expedition taught us was that the only way to appease him is to honor his spirit.${prompt}
  8669: What we must do is cast off this ridiculous premise of “rituals” and “purgations” and revere the founder king as he demands!${prompt}
  8670: Just as we did back then, we must go and reseal his tomb once more.${prompt}
  8671: Hildebert! It is wholly inappropriate of you to make rash statements in such a place!${prompt}
  8672: P-perhaps you are right...${prompt}
  8673: It makes me wonder...do you not feel that the circumstances surrounding our colonization efforts are quite different from those of the Great Expedition?${prompt}
  8674: Do we even have the time or money to appease his spirit?${prompt}
  8675: “Time or money”!?${prompt}
  8676: I imply nothing, my dear Hildebert, only that as the minister of finance, we must undertake all things with due caution.${prompt}
  8677: Though many remember the Great Expedition for its ultimate failure, at the time Adoulin was able to receive much from the bounty of the wilds.${prompt}
  8678: Should you doubt my words, I bid you head to the Celennia Memorial Library and read for yourself.${prompt}
  8679: Do so, and you will understand why I staunchly support the colonization initiative.${prompt}
  8680: Our nation has waned in influence since those grand times, though I fear such words will not sway you now.${prompt}
  8681: And you would dare turn a matter of faith into one of coin!? You and your kind are a blight on this land!${prompt}
  8682: Nothing could be farther from the truth. No, I cannot in good conscience support policies predicated on our people dying of hunger and languishing in the streets.${prompt}
  8683: Are you mocking me?${prompt}
  8684: This isn't about you, this is about not being able to wring blood from a stone!${prompt}
  8685: Both of you, please!${prompt}
  8686: Please, just...just stop...${prompt}
  8687: |-
    Nooo...!
    However could it have come to this!?${prompt}
  8688: You still do not understand, old fool?${prompt}
  8689: This is deserved castigation at the hands of nature...your comeuppance for supporting the forbidden act of colonization and draining the lifeblood of this continent.${prompt}
  8690: I agree that her curse is a result of her father's stance on colonization, but I think the agency behind her malady belongs to a different source.${prompt}
  8691: This is nothing other than a premeditated conspiracy to hinder our colonization of Ulbuka.${prompt}
  8692: And just who is capable of such a heinous act? Why, witches, of course.${prompt}
  8693: Witches? Preposterous! Surely you cannot think their ilk still exists?${prompt}
  8694: They exist without a doubt, and I fear we know them all too well.${prompt}
  8695: I'm sure even you can't have forgotten about the destruction wrought by that monstrous coven...${prompt}
  8696: |-
    ...No, you cannot possibly mean...
    That is downright absurd!${prompt}
  8697: Your obsession with finding evil in every corner has gone too far. You exorcists are worse than zealots, you're--${prompt}
  8698: I would stay my tongue if I were you.${prompt}
  8699: Let's just say that it would do you well to remember what profession Hildebert's right-hand man is. You don't want Lord Vortimere discovering how incompetent you feel he is, do you?${prompt}
  8700: |-
    Not another fight!
    I can't go anywhere anymore without seeing people at each other's throats...${prompt}
  8701: |-
    What will you do?
    ${selection-lines}
    Comfort Arciela.
    Shut the Weatherspooners up.${prompt}
  8702: You're right, ${name-player}. I shouldn't let my emotions get the best of me.${prompt}
  8703: That's why we can't just stand by and let their tempers flare.${prompt}
  8704: |-
    No!
    You'll only be adding fuel to the fire, and we can't have this animosity over colonization spreading any further than it already has!${prompt}
  8705: Who in the Goddess's auspices are you!?${prompt}
  8706: Well, if it isn't the Middle Lander. And I see you brought the princess with you...${prompt}
  8707: I humbly request that you two put this quarrel to rest. Stirring up each other's emotions won't solve anything, especially over something like this.${prompt}
  8708: This isn't merely “something,” my dear princess. A girl has been cursed.${prompt}
  8709: |-
    Slow down!
    Shouldn't we hear what Pollimio has to say before jumping to conclusions?${prompt}
  8710: Now, sir, could you please tell us exactly what happened to your daughter Nyline?${prompt}
  8711: |-
    Yes, of course.
    However, I doubt what I have to say will offer much insight. I barely understand her condition myself.${prompt}
  8712: As I told the Peacekeepers earlier, my daughter has recently begun exhibiting rather strange behavior.${prompt}
  8713: She wanders the streets night after night as one possessed. If no one is there to stop her, she unfailingly meanders into the wilds.
  8714: It's obvious she would act like that. This is a textbook example of a curse.${prompt}
  8715: You are but preaching to the choir, and I tire of having to continually explain that.${prompt}
  8716: My apologies, sir and madam...${prompt}
  8717: You can ignore their aspersions. If you have anything else to add, we'd be grateful to hear it.${prompt}
  8718: Let me think...${prompt}
  8719: Well, once she has fallen into that state, her eyes wander as if staring at nothing in particular. Engaging in conversation with her is nigh on impossible.${prompt}
  8720: Ah, but sometimes she will turn and face a certain direction, then unleash a barrage of incomprehensible gibberish.${prompt}
  8721: Like I said before, despite giving off the appearance that her mind is somewhere else, the moment you look away, she vanishes into the woods.${prompt}
  8722: I know not what would have become of my precious Nyline had those two kind souls at the bivouac not been there to see to her welfare.${prompt}
  8723: And where is your daughter now?${prompt}
  8724: She is in the next room over, fast asleep.${prompt}
  8725: I see...${prompt}
  8726: So...you two have cause to believe that these are signs of a curse?${prompt}
  8727: And, Ingrid, you say you've heard of a similar phenomenon?${prompt}
  8728: Indeed I have.${prompt}
  8729: Whilst on my travels through the Middle Lands, I heard a tale of an individual who was afflicted by the curses of evil spirits. He was doomed to walk the streets of his city both night and day, without reprieve.${prompt}
  8730: However, he left behind a legacy. To this very day, the people of his land dress up as ghosts once a year and have others chase after them. The pursuers even receive delectable confections for their efforts.${prompt}
  8731: The origin of such festivities is almost certainly linked to a historical event in the distant past.${prompt}
  8732: Why the participants would reward pursuers with candy is beyond me. What illogical traditions those easterners have.${prompt}
  8733: I'd say that the practice likely comes from an ancient ceremony that served the same function as exorcisms do today.${prompt}
  8734: |-
    My, my, my. To think that such a ludicrous custom would have a rich history behind it...
    A stunning story if ever I have heard one.${prompt}
  8735: '...Thanks. I thought it was pretty good myself.${prompt}'
  8736: What!? You mean to say that you fabricated that whole explanation!?${prompt}
  8737: Cassard, your blatant lack of diligence disturbs me. Our order would surely sink into disrepute with you at its helm.${prompt}
  8738: While you've been content to remain snugly within your proverbial Ulbukan washbin, I've explored seas wider than you could possibly imagine and returned with a veritable treasure trove of information.${prompt}
  8739: For example, did you know that people in the Middle Lands have, for some years, succeeded in communicating with the spirits of an ancient witch brood?${prompt}
  8740: The name of that brood would not happen to be...the Dark Lilies...would it?${prompt}
  8741: |-
    Ah, so you are familiar with them?
    I can't say as I am surprised, though, as everyone in the Order of Weatherspoon should have heard that name at some point.${prompt}
  8742: |-
    Let's give you a challenge, then.
    What about the rumors that the troop of evildoers who skulk about the hinterland are the Dark Lilies' successors?${prompt}
  8743: I refuse to believe such tripe.${prompt}
  8744: |-
    “Troop,” you say?
    So there are multiple witches involved?${prompt}
  8745: |-
    Yes.
    I can say with full confidence that this is the work of the Blackthorn Coven.${prompt}
  8746: The Blackthorn Coven...${prompt}
  8747: A tyrannous clan of apocalypses incarnate, they might as well be joined at the hip for how often they're seen apart.${prompt}
  8748: They've set Eastern Ulbuka ablaze with their surreptitious experiments and single-handedly extinguished the burning passions of numerous pioneers.${prompt}
  8749: They somehow continue to evade us, flying back into the forest only to bare their talons at a later date. No wonder they're also known as the Heinous Harpies.${prompt}
  8750: It is this nefarious sisterhood to which your daughter has fallen victim!${prompt}
  8751: No, you're wrong!${prompt}
  8752: '...At least that''s what I want to believe.${prompt}'
  8753: I understand that they may be likened to harpies, but I simply don't think they're capable of something like this.${prompt}
  8754: What's more, ${name-player} knows something about this Nyline incident that you don't.${prompt}
  8755: Go on, tell them.${prompt}
  8756: Yes, please. Indulge us, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8757: |-
    What will you tell them?
    ${selection-lines}
    It might be the work of forest sprites.
    I don't know what she's on about.${prompt}
  8758: I know you fancy yourself a jester of the highest degree, but this isn't the time for japes! Just tell us what you know.${prompt}
  8759: |-
    I see...
    So, if she were called by forest sprites, then...${prompt}
  8760: |-
    That is far enough, Arciela.
    You do not truly believe in this flagrant display of balderdash, do you? Does ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] have any evidence with which to support this outrageous argument?${prompt}
  8761: '...We have enough, in my opinion.${prompt}'
  8762: For example, I've noticed a spiritual aura in the air ever since we entered this dwelling.${prompt}
  8763: It's undeniably faint--almost like the scent of far-off flowers borne aloft on the morning breeze. However, I can still sense it... The feeling greatly resembles what ${name-player} and I experienced when we met those spirits in the Ceizak Battlegrounds.${prompt}
  8764: We'd have to investigate further before making any definite statements, but what ${name-player} proposes seems more than plausible.${prompt}
  8765: |-
    Auras hanging in the air? Flowery scents?
    Fie, I say! You employ florid metaphors to divert our attention from your specious reasoning. This is none other than the curse of the wilds!${prompt}
  8766: Mister Pollimio is a leading figure of the colonization movement, and has been targeted precisely because of his position. His daughter and the chancellor have been cursed to show that not even the most influential Adoulinians are above the will of the woodlands!${prompt}
  8767: With that, I bid you farewell. I have no more time to squander on sophistry when I'm expected at the Weatherspoon manse for vespers.${prompt}
  8768: Pollimio, you would do well to leave everything to me. I shall make sure that you receive the full support of Hildebert as well.${prompt}
  8769: Therefore, once we lift the curse, all I ask is that you grant us a few minimal favors.${prompt}
  8770: I think you mean “if” you lift the curse. I honestly don't see you succeeding where your betters have failed.${prompt}
  8771: |-
    Hmph.
    Squawk all you want, but when the time comes, you and the princess will be proven for the fledglings that you are.${prompt}
  8772: Now, if you would excuse me, I have a citizen to save.${prompt}
  8773: If he wants to waste his time praying, that's his prerogative.${prompt}
  8774: 'We all know there''s only one way to lift a coven''s curse: send them back from whence they came!${prompt}'
  8775: Once this world is no longer defiled by their presence, the girl shall once again be free.${prompt}
  8776: Let the fires of divine judgment cleanse them of their iniquity!${prompt}
  8777: Who do I believe here? They both promise me my daughter's return to normalcy, but their methods seem diametrically opposed...${prompt}
  8778: 'What about your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${name-player}? Does it sense any abnormal presence?${prompt}'
  8779: 'Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} exhibits no reaction whatsoever.${prompt}'
  8780: Well, it doesn't have anything to do with the leafkin.${prompt}
  8781: |-
    I guess that proves Cassard wrong.
    Your pome would surely have reacted in some way if the woods were involved.${prompt}
  8782: Moreover, I seriously don't think the Blackthorn Coven has anything to do with this. That leaves--${prompt}
  8783: |-
    Mistress Arciela...
    I beg of you, please save my daughter...${prompt}
  8784: Don't worry, I'll do everything in my power to cure your daughter of this affliction. However, I'll need your help with something in order to accomplish that.${prompt}
  8785: A strange spiritual energy permeates this room even as we speak.${prompt}
  8786: Could either you or your daughter possibly have brought back any artifacts from the forest?${prompt}
  8787: That seems highly unlikely. I may be a proponent of colonization, but I have personally never strode into the hinterland.${prompt}
  8788: '...Ahhh, come to think of it, I did purchase an enchanting stone at the market the other day.${prompt}'
  8789: The vendor told me that it comes from deep within the Ulbukan jungle, and resembled no jewel or mineral I had previously seen.${prompt}
  8790: Not only did it have a peculiar shape, but it was so overlarge that it could not fit in my palm. And the color! Upon first glance it was a stunning shade of crimson, but upon further inspection, it shone as warmingly yellow as the sun.${prompt}
  8791: I rarely express any interest in expensive jewels, but I simply had to have this rare specimen for my collection.${prompt}
  8792: It wonderfully complements my Altana-shaped tree root and the rock Sverdhried once slipped upon whilst climbing his eponymous hillock.${prompt}
  8793: Many of my colleagues have also succumbed to the temptation of the collector, for we all possess menageries of bizarre objects.${prompt}
  8794: In fact, the stone in question is said to have previously been worshipped as a vessel of transcendental power.${prompt}
  8795: The merchant who sold it to me added that it could very well have been crafted for communion with a creator deity. He was not so forthcoming with a name of which one, but I am certain it must be important.${prompt}
  8796: |-
    My daughter was captivated by the stone's mystic properties, even more so than me, so I bequeathed it unto her.
    ...Now that I mention it, her behavior started to change soon after receiving the stone.${prompt}
  8797: |-
    Aha, so that stone's likely the culprit.
    Pollimio, would you mind if I met with your daughter? I have some questions for her.${prompt}
  8798: |-
    Of course not. Do as you please.
    Her room is the next one over.${prompt}
  8799: She's done it again, dear!${prompt}
  8800: What!? She's gone!?${prompt}
  8801: When I went to check on her, the window was open and she was nowhere to be seen!${prompt}
  8802: |-
    Damn this curse!
    We'd best start looking for her immediately... Hopefully she has not gone far.${prompt}
  8803: Let's help look for her, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  8804: Where do you suggest we start?${prompt}
  8805: |-
    Where will you look for Nyline?
    ${selection-lines}
    The forest.
    All over town.
    The chest of drawers.${prompt}
  8806: I hope you find a real sense of humor in there, because you're certainly not going to find a grown woman.${prompt}
  8807: Great minds think alike!${prompt}
  8808: So we agree that it's probably those spirits calling out to her again?${prompt}
  8809: So you want to chase her down, then?${prompt}
  8810: Let's do it! It'll be like a game of Peacekeepers and Pickpockets!${prompt}
  8811: I doubt those sprites bear any ill will towards Nyline...${prompt}
  8812: But I get the feeling that something awful will happen if she enters those woods.${prompt}
  8813: Pollimio, could I ask you to please search the town while ${name-player} and I look for her at the edge of the forest?${prompt}
  8814: Ma'am, we'll let you know immediately once we find her, so please don't move from this spot.${prompt}
  8815: Al-alright.${prompt}
  8816: Understood.${prompt}
  8817: I searched the city high and low but found not a trace of her. She must have ventured into the woods.${prompt}
  8818: My poor, helpless Nyline...<sob>${prompt}
  8819: Father!${prompt}
  8820: Nyline!${prompt}
  8821: |-
    I'm so happy you're okay!${wait-36: 1}
    Arciela, thank you so much!${prompt}
  8822: Hmph...${prompt}
  8823: (Damn it.)${prompt}
  8824: We are eternally grateful for what you and that frontier friend of yours have done for us, Princess. Oh, I almost forgot that pioneer friend of yours...${prompt}
  8825: ${name-player}. ${choice-player-gender}[His/Her] name's ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8826: |-
    Thank you as well, ${name-player}.
    This reward may not be commensurate with that which you receive in the Middle Lands, but it is all I have on hand.${prompt}
  8827: I apologize for the inconvenience I have caused you two, and may you never have to endure an ordeal such as this again.${prompt}
  8828: Now maybe Mother can stop nagging you about getting suckered in by shady vendors.${prompt}
  8829: Worry not, my love. I shall never purchase another obscure bauble as long as I live.${prompt}
  8830: Hee hee hee, your daughter's right, Pollimio. There're likely ponzes upon ponzes of potential dangers lying in wait within the hinterland.${prompt}
  8831: Until we know exactly how upsetting them will influence our own lives, we'd best be careful.${prompt}
  8832: The girl speaks the truth. It is best to let sleeping chocobos lie, so we must never venture forth into the jungle again.${prompt}
  8833: Please don't put words in my mouth. That's not what I was saying...${prompt}
  8834: Either way, it seems that what was afflicting Nyline is no more.${prompt}
  8835: If that is the case, then there is no reason for me to stick around. Goodbye.${prompt}
  8836: I too must take my leave and inform Hildebert of what has transpired.${prompt}
  8837: Neither of those two is willing to give an ilm... Is there nothing we can do to get them to cooperate?${prompt}
  8838: Nevertheless, I can't believe your intuition, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8839: If you hadn't told me she was summoned to the forest by spirits, I would never have noticed their aura in the house.${prompt}
  8840: Nyline would also still be alone and confused in the heart of Hennetiel.${prompt}
  8841: If we'd arrived even a few minutes later, she might've been eaten by Goddess-knows-what.${prompt}
  8842: |-
    Got anything to say?
    ${selection-lines}
    I can't take credit for this.
    Yeah, you're rather sloppy.${prompt}
  8843: That genuinely hurt my feelings, ${name-player}. Could you please try to temper your words to sound a bit more constructive next time?${prompt}
  8844: What? Why can't you take credit for this?${prompt}
  8845: Wait, so someone gave you the idea when you found Nyline in the battlegrounds? Who could that be, I wonder...${prompt}
  8846: |-
    He had...
    ${selection-lines}
    Black hair and a beard.
    Spindly gray hair and looked decrepit.${prompt}
  8847: |-
    His clothes were..
    ${selection-lines}
    White as Velkk slobber.
    Black as a mourning veil.${prompt}
  8848: |-
    He wore...
    ${selection-lines}
    A mysterious mantle.
    The daintiest skirt I've ever seen.${prompt}
  8849: |-
    He had with him...
    ${selection-lines}
    A sword that could pierce the heavens.
    A jewel-encrusted staff.${prompt}
  8850: |-
    He must be a unique individual if you remember all that about him.
    An old man dressed all in black...${prompt}
  8851: Aha, could that possibly have been Teodor?${prompt}
  8852: I think you have your facts messed up, ${name-player}. No one I know in Adoulin fits that description.${prompt}
  8853: Let me think... The only mysterious guy I know of always wears black and has a pitch-black personality...${prompt}
  8854: Aha, I bet you're thinking of Teodor!${prompt}
  8855: That'd make sense. Seeing as how he's lived on the Ulbukan mainland for quite some time, he's sure to know things that we don't.${prompt}
  8856: Yes...he would...${prompt}
  8857: Hey, ${name-player}, do you think that we should ask him about my brother?${prompt}
  8858: Maybe he can shed some light on that situation, too.${prompt}
  8859: ${name-player}!${prompt}
  8860: I just want to say...I believe in you! I know you can figure out what my brother wanted to tell us.${prompt}
  8861: I'm not going to pawn off all the responsibility to you, though. I'll search for Teodor in my spare time as well.${prompt}
  8862: Until we meet again, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  8863: That meddling princess and her adventurer pet! I feel as if they have made it their personal mission to assassinate my character!${prompt}
  8864: |-
    Nothing good ever comes from being in the same room as them!
    Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!${prompt}
  8865: |-
    Haaah...haaah...haaah.
    All right, Ingrid, calm down.${prompt}
  8866: You can't have Vortimere getting wind of what happened...not after you promised him you wouldn't make another mistake.${prompt}
  8867: Let the Middle Lander be. When all is said and done, no one would lend an ear to a money-grubbing outsider.${prompt}
  8868: The true threat to the exorcists' resurgence is the princess.${prompt}
  8869: Mark my words, Arciela V. Adoulin. Soon enough, you shall regret ever having crossed “Ingrid the Merciless.”${prompt}
  8870: Well, I'll be. Look who it is!${prompt}
  8871: '.........Wait. Who are you again?${prompt}'
  8872: Heavens, where was it I saw you? Let me think. Was it the place...? With the thing...?${prompt}
  8873: Oh, right! One of those pioneers that's on everyone's lips.${prompt}
  8874: Was it...${name-player}?${prompt}
  8875: Oh, hooray! I got it! I just knew I could!${prompt}
  8876: But, sweet mercy, there's no time for small talk!${prompt}
  8877: You, um...wouldn't happen to have seen the princess, would you?${prompt}
  8878: |-
    Why, I mean Arciela, silly!
    ...But you knew that, didn't you?${prompt}
  8879: |-
    So...you haven't.
    Oh dear, what a terrible conundrum! You don't suppose she ran off to the forest again?${prompt}
  8880: |-
    About what will you inquire?
    ${selection-lines}
    Where Arciela is.
    Why she would go to the forest.${prompt}
  8881: I... Well, to be honest, I'm not sure either.${prompt}
  8882: Were you even listening to a word I said!?${prompt}
  8883: I may do nothing all day but polish floors and scrub chamber pots, but certainly I deserve a little more respect!${prompt}
  8884: But let's not reopen that wound, hmm?${prompt}
  8885: I thought you would know better than I. After all, the two of you seem to have been through a lot together.${prompt}
  8886: She tries to smile and laugh it off, but let me tell you--under that happy exterior, she's suffering inside. Yup!${prompt}
  8887: <Whisper> I mean, have you heard about her brother?${prompt}
  8888: He's just so...so...${prompt}
  8889: So adorable! Eeek! I just want to squeeze him and bite those little toes off!
  8890: O-oh dear! I didn't say that, and no one can prove that I did!${prompt}
  8891: Ahem. Be that as it may, Arciela is stricken with worry.${prompt}
  8892: And not just for her brother, mind you. You should hear all the ruckus when the pro- and anti-colonization factions happen to meet in the halls!${prompt}
  8893: It tears at her so much that I cannot blame her for wanting to escape from the castle.${prompt}
  8894: It was just like back then...${prompt}
  8895: |-
    What will you ask?
    ${selection-lines}
    “Back then”?
    Can you explain?${prompt}
  8896: Explain? Well...${prompt}
  8897: This is only a story I heard from my mother, who had been nursing Arciela after she was born. This was before Ygnas ascended to grand chancellor.${prompt}
  8898: Ygnas was quite a clever young man, but still--a child is a child. His father was always droning on to him about whether or not colonization should recommence.${prompt}
  8899: The castle grew dark, and the tension was so thick you could stab it with a fork.${prompt}
  8900: Arciela always puts on that brave facade of hers, but she detests such heated arguments. She's always been quite sensitive and delicate, you see.${prompt}
  8901: So one day, she said enough is enough, and left the castle for the wildlands.${prompt}
  8902: Imagine! Such a place is dangerous even for prepared adults, so what hope could a young child have of coming back alive!?${prompt}
  8903: Of course, a search party was dispatched as soon as they figured out what happened...but no one could find her.${prompt}
  8904: Everyone had all but given up hope when, one week later...${prompt}
  8905: One of the soldiers found her sound asleep in a grassy meadow, one of the few places where light shone through to the forest floor.${prompt}
  8906: Arciela was surrounded by all manner of fauna, circled around her frail form as if protecting her.${prompt}
  8907: The tale goes that when the party approached her, the beasts did not attack, but instead slowly left, one by one, receding back into the tree line.${prompt}
  8908: But it gets stranger! One week she had been in the forest, yet there was not a single scratch upon her pale skin, and her tummy gave not so much as a single rumble.${prompt}
  8909: And what's more, Arciela had not a single memory of what she had been doing during that time.${prompt}
  8910: The only clue we had was a torn piece of cloth marked with a particular sigil that she clutched tightly in her left hand.${prompt}
  8911: |-
    Inquire about what?
    ${selection-lines}
    The torn piece of cloth.
    The sigil.${prompt}
  8912: The sigil? Why, I was just a sweet, innocent young girl barely about to blossom into a stunning young woman! Why would I know about that?${prompt}
  8913: And will you please stop making that face?${prompt}
  8914: Yes, a mere piece of cloth.${prompt}
  8915: Well, when they saw the sigil embroidered on that piece of cloth, the heads of the Twelve Orders stood straight up in their chairs! ...Or so I've heard.${prompt}
  8916: Hildebert said in his usual stuffy voice, “To think that he would bring such shadows unto our fair city...”${prompt}
  8917: In other words, all those bigwigs felt that this man, whoever he was, was at Arciela's side. All too mysterious, don't you agree?${prompt}
  8918: She came back to the castle happier than anyone had ever seen her.${prompt}
  8919: Before that, she had been a bit of a shut-in, never passing through the castle gates, but she started to walk around the city more after the incident.${prompt}
  8920: And when Ygnas took on the mantle of grand chancellor, she started venturing into Ulbuka more often.${prompt}
  8921: And you know what? Things are just like they were then--never once did the denizens of the jungle so much as breathe on her.${prompt}
  8922: It baffles me to the high heavens! Soldiers and pioneers come scurrying back with their tails between their legs, but some mysterious power shields our princess from harm.${prompt}
  8923: Though she may be beloved by a certain portion of our citizenry, thanks to those events, there are more than a few who view her with unease.${prompt}
  8924: Some even call her the...the “Wildborn Witch”!${prompt}
  8925: Oh dear, my poor Arciela!${prompt}
  8926: Why must people say such foul things? There's not a kinder soul in all of Adoulin. It burns my blood to even think of it!${prompt}
  8927: Oh, ${name-player}...I didn't mean to take it out on you. It's just...overwhelming, you know?${prompt}
  8928: Now you understand why I believe she must be wandering the wildlands if she's not in the castle.${prompt}
  8929: The next time you go to the Ulbukan mainland, please--bring her back with you.${prompt}
  8930: |-
    How will you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course I will.
    I'm afraid I can't do that.${prompt}
  8931: I'm so glad to hear you say that. I worry about her so...${prompt}
  8932: But...why?${prompt}
  8933: You're going to say that she probably needs some time alone to rest her weary spirit.${prompt}
  8934: I suppose you're right. You understand her better than I do.${prompt}
  8935: And your concern shows her trust in you is not misplaced.${prompt}
  8936: Just promise me you'll look after her.${prompt}
  8937: After all, we live in troubling times. Her brother needs her perhaps more than any of us do.${prompt}
  8938: So, again, I...${prompt}
  8939: B-by Altana! What's going on?${prompt}
  8940: What's wrong? Out with it!${prompt}
  8941: I-it's Arciela! She...she...!${prompt}
  8942: She's been abducted by monsters!${prompt}
  8943: |-
    Wh-wh-wh...
    Wh...
  8944: What!?
  8945: The princess--she's been taken by some horrible beast! If you are truly a friend to the order, then you must go to the wilds to rescue her!${prompt}
  8946: Is it true that Arciela was spirited away? That poor girl!${prompt}
  8947: If the latest reports are to be believed, then it is indeed true. Apparently a behemothic creature snatched her up in its jaws and fled to the jungle's inner recesses.${prompt}
  8948: Perhaps “snatched up” is a tad euphemistic. From what I have heard, “gulped down” would be much more appropriate.${prompt}
  8949: If that is the case, maybe she should “swallow” her pride and relinquish her title of “Wildborn Witch.”${prompt}
  8950: |-
    Melvien!
    Do you understand just how inappropriate that was!?${prompt}
  8951: My pardons, Gratzigg.${prompt}
  8952: Still, I get the meataru of his argument.${prompt}
  8953: She's wandered off into the forestaru hundreds of times and emerged without even a scratch.${prompt}
  8954: Didn't she sleep-weep amongst the fauna all by her lonesome, too? She should be fine even if we make like trees and leave her alone.${prompt}
  8955: Plus, maybe the beastaru just mistook her for one of its cubs and carried her back to its den!${prompt}
  8956: It is completely absurd to even entertain such an idea!${prompt}
  8957: I never knew how true rang the phrase “Wise men speak because they have something to say, fools because they have to say something” until now.${prompt}
  8958: And would you care to impart to us your wisdom regarding this incident, Ingrid?${prompt}
  8959: I witnessed the whole thing, and I must profess that the walking atrocity in question had nothing more on its mind than to tear our dear princess limb from--${prompt}
  8960: I propose that we send a search party for Arciela, which I will command, as soon as possible. We cannot lose even a moment to superfluous debates simply for the sake of following procedure.${prompt}
  8961: You nominate yourself as commander?${prompt}
  8962: I thought that went without question!${prompt}
  8963: I wh-wh-wholeheartedly approve this measure. After what has befallen Ygnas, Arciela is the last d-d-descendant of the founder king who can...lead our nation to glory.${prompt}
  8964: There is no t-t-time to waste on mustering troops. The exorcists will be...happy to send their unit of elites...which can be m-m-mobilized immediately!${prompt}
  8965: (How...weird.)${prompt}
  8966: (I never would've thought I'd live to see Lord Vortimere volunteering to help Arciela, let alone put his most valued troops at risk on her behalf.)${prompt}
  8967: (Being part of the founder king's lineage must be even more important than I'd thought!)${prompt}
  8968: We would be ever so grateful for your help, Vortimere. I, for one, place the fate of our nation in your capable hands.${prompt}
  8969: Th-th-thank you for the vote of confidence, Svenja. We shall not...b-b-betray your trust.${prompt}
  8970: 'Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} glows brightly, grabbing your attention.${prompt}'
  8971: Its deep red hue can only be interpreted as a warning of ominous events to come.${prompt}
  8972: |-
    I just had an epiphany!
    How about we have ${name-player} take part in your expedition?${prompt}
  8973: ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] has traversed the Ulbukan continent time and time again. ${choice-player-gender}[His/Her] expert knowledge of the field should be an invaluable addition to your squad!${prompt}
  8974: With all...due respect, Lady Svenja, it would be d-d-detrimental for the country to rely upon an...outsider at this juncture.${prompt}
  8975: ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] may be from another land, but Arciela has formed a deep bond with ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] that transcends nationality.${prompt}
  8976: I am truly sorry to heap such an arduous task upon you like this, but would you do us the service of accompanying the exorcists in search of our princess?${prompt}
  8977: |-
    What will you do?
    ${selection-lines}
    Accept the offer.
    Back down.${prompt}
  8978: Oh, I cannot adequately express the depth of my gratitude toward you! What a kind soul you are.${prompt}
  8979: I...I am immensely sorry to hear that.${prompt}
  8980: Are you sure you do not want to reconsider?${prompt}
  8981: Fret not, dear Svenya. Our exorcists are all...highly trained v-v-veterans who have proven themselves...irreproachable beyond the slightest d-d-doubt.${prompt}
  8982: They are p-p-precisely what Adoulin needs to...subdue this t-t-terrifying menace!${prompt}
  8983: If there is no further debate, I shall set about r-r-rallying my unit.${prompt}
  8984: But, please, I b-b-beseech you...to keep this incident a secret. We wouldn't want our fair citizens to...worry over an issue that is basically s-s-solved, would we?${prompt}
  8985: ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8986: The creatures that skulk amidst Ulbuka's wilds have claimed the lives of many an unprepared pioneer. It may well behoove you to acquaint yourself with your enemy before endeavoring to slay him.${prompt}
  8987: |-
    Any questions for Melvien?
    ${selection-lines}
    How do I do that?
    Can you acquaint me with the tiger?${prompt}
  8988: I must say that you have an excellent sense of humor. Sadly, however, I have been within the city walls the whole time and know practically nothing about the beast.${prompt}
  8989: |-
    Why, the answer is right under your nose. The Pioneers' Coalition is here to serve pioneers.
    Though Lord Vortimere may have said to keep this under the table, I hardly think only mentioning a “golden tiger” would arouse suspicion.${prompt}
  8990: |-
    However, it does intrigue me that--
    Never mind. Forget I said a word.${prompt}
  8991: I wish you a swift and convincing victory, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8992: Come crawling back, have we, Middle Lander?${prompt}
  8993: One would think you emerged from Svenja's own womb, the way she coddles you.${prompt}
  8994: She may have forced me to enlist your help in this search, but remember this, you ${choice-player-gender}[churlish brute/tottering wench].${prompt}
  8995: I, by my infinitely good graces, am allowing you to assist me--not the other way around. Got it?${prompt}
  8996: |-
    Good.
    You are to report even the seemingly most insignificant pieces of information directly to me, no ifs, ands, or buts.${prompt}
  8997: Why, if it isn't...${prompt}
  8998: |-
    ああ、待って名乗らなくていい。
    すぐに思い出すから。${prompt}

    その装備……。

    「${name-player}の胴鎧」……。${prompt}
  9000: ${name-player}? I did not misremember your name, did I?${prompt}
  9001: |-
    Oh, thank the heavens.
    I do remember clearly, however, that you were present at the fateful gathering of heads.${prompt}
  9002: I am constantly dangling from a slippery precipice, upon which myriad critical matters hang in the balance. It certainly is a wonder how I manage to remember anything at all.${prompt}
  9003: I suppose that is neither here nor there. I doubt you care to know why it was so hard for me to dredge your alias up from the riverbed of my mind.${prompt}
  9004: |-
    おや、あなた……。
    ${name-player}、とか言ったか。
    むろん覚えているとも。${prompt}
  9005: |-
    中の国の冒険者で、
    「${name-player}のジョブ」だろう？${prompt}
  9006: You carry our nation upon your back as you clear the way for progress, and you are currently in the process of uncovering where the light from our brightest star has gone.${prompt}
  9007: What would someone of your standing want with our Scouts' Coalition?${prompt}
  9008: But first, let me preempt your inquiry with a corollary. Despite our collective effort to gaze above and beyond our borders, we still do not know what has become of that star.${prompt}
  9009: |-
    Oh.
    But if you do not wish to know of her whereabouts, I have not a clue as to why you are here.${prompt}
  9010: |-
    Ahhh, I see.
    That goliath with towers for teeth and forest-thick pelage is what you seek?${prompt}
  9011: Regrettably, I haven't heard a whit about that particular colossus.${prompt}
  9012: The feline part, though, does rub me a certain way.${prompt}
  9013: I take it you've heard of Kumhau, the Flashfrost Naakual?${prompt}
  9014: All other bestial hellions that stalk the Ulbukan jungle look up to him in fear.${prompt}
  9015: If there were a creature on the whole continent who'd know this monstrosity's whereabouts, it'd be him.${prompt}
  9016: Sorry that I have nothing further to offer, but I cannot imagine you need much more.${prompt}
  9017: |-
    Where can you meet him? That would be pertinent information, indeed.
    He may be found prowling the banks of a lake that lies within Kamihr Drifts and is rent by the cries of deities.${prompt}
  9018: |-
    なに？
    ${name-player}は
    クムハウに会ったことがないのかい？${prompt}

    As you will not be heading into battle, you'll require a special device to make your intentions known.
    Just a moment.${prompt}
  9022: Here we go. Take this with you when you visit those snowy dunes that lie far to the northwest.${prompt}
  9023: 'The Inventors'' Coalition developed this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, and it releases a special noise when rung. To people like us, it''s as silent as a snow-covered night, but for some creatures...let''s say it gets their attention.${prompt}'
  9024: I will admit that this is neither an orthodox nor a safe method, but desperate times call for desperate measures.${prompt}
  9025: I am loath to put someone who's done so much for our alliance in harm's way, but I cannot think of a more appropriate solution at this point.${prompt}
  9026: Remember, emphasize that you harbor no ill will and are only there for the golden tiger. That will stem the tide of his rage and keep you alive...I hope.${prompt}
  9027: Good luck out there. You'll surely need it.${prompt}
  9028: Why, hello, ${name-player}. What brings you back to Castle Adoulin?${prompt}
  9029: |-
    What brings you here?
    ${selection-lines}
    I was supposed to meet someone.
    Where's Ingrid?${prompt}
  9030: What? Ingrid told you to report directly to her once you had garnered any sort of intelligence?${prompt}
  9031: How peculiar...${prompt}
  9032: She informed me that her retainers had discovered the princess's location. They all departed some time ago.${prompt}
  9033: I had assumed that you were among their ranks, but that is clearly not the case. I wonder why she would choose to leave you in the lurch.${prompt}
  9034: Why am I not surprised to see you, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  9035: To heal the World Tree, we must ask the World Tree for its help. So, of course, I thought...${prompt}
  9036: Ar...ci...ela...${prompt}
  9037: Ygnas...Morimar told us the truth.${prompt}
  9038: He said you were using the curse as a way to further understand the World Tree.${prompt}
  9039: And the whole time, none of us knew.${prompt}
  9040: ${name-player}, show him what Sajj'aka gave you.${prompt}
  9041: '${color-alt: 15}You show Ygnas the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.'
  9042: 'Ygnas, do you see this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} ${name-player} has? It''s to help us revive the World Tree.${prompt}'
  9043: But if what the dragon Sajj'aka says is true, then there is no place left in Ulbuka sacred enough to plant it.${prompt}
  9044: He believes that we must use the World Tree itself if we are to make it whole again. What do you think he means?${prompt}
  9045: '...${prompt}'
  9046: Ygnas...oh no! What if he can no longer speak?${prompt}

    I don't understand...it doesn't seem to make any sense. Maybe he meant something else.${prompt}
  9055: Tree grafting?${prompt}
  9056: Isn't that where you take part of one tree and attach it to another so they both live? Oh, ${name-player}, you're magnificent!${prompt}
  9057: Ygnas...thank you.${prompt}
  9058: One issue remains. How are we supposed to graft a sapling to roots buried so far underground?${prompt}

  9062: Oh, thank goodness. He appears to have merely passed out.${prompt}
  9063: Was that...a forest? Are you telling us to search for it?${prompt}
  9064: Feeling a bit lost? I'm sure someone at the Pioneerrrs' Coalition can help you.${prompt}
  9065: |-
    <Sigh>...
    No one at the castle could believe their ears when I told them of Melvien's “disappearance”--least of all the other ministers. I suppose there's no helping that.${prompt}
  9066: |-
    How do you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    You must have had your hands full.
    I suppose not.${prompt}
  9067: I'm so glad you stuck with me through it all, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9068: I have begun to open my eyes to the world ever since we first met. There was so much I didn't know--about pioneering, the jungle, and even my own homeland.${prompt}
  9069: Every step is a new journey. Cooped up in the castle like I was, I forgot what real life was like.${prompt}
  9070: But you showed me that I must not be content with how I am right now, that I must continue to push myself each day. For that, I will always be grateful.${prompt}
  9071: I'd like to present you with a little something, from both me and my brother.${prompt}
  9072: I know these trinkets aren't much, but they're artifacts that symbolize important moments in Adoulin's history.${prompt}
  9073: I'd like to let you have them all, but...${prompt}

    Yes.

  9080: Do you remember that ancient Adoulinian song I sang back on Mount Kamihr?${prompt}
  9081: Maybe Morimar is right.${prompt}
  9082: “The light of dawn comes from the east.”${prompt}
  9083: I, for one, believe you pioneers have been sent to rescue this land.${prompt}
  9084: Forgive me if my words cause undue burden.
  9085: The World Tree may be safe, yet Adoulin's struggles are far from over.${prompt}
  9086: But as long as we live, we will keep fighting.${prompt}
  9087: And, ${name-player}...we will continue to need your help.${prompt}

    Though storms may brew and threaten the land,

    It remains resolute before man, before beast,

  9097: The princess has been moping about lately...and if anyone knows what happened to her, I figured it'd be you.${prompt}
  9098: I tried asking Cynthia, but she never gives me a straight answer, and given the way she nods off while on duty...well, you're just a better person to ask.${prompt}
  9099: Sweet mercy, say something! I'm not letting you budge until you spill the beans!${prompt}
  9100: 'The Peacekeepers'' Coalition has arrived at the only reasonable conclusion: the wounds on his body are signs of a struggle.${prompt}'
  9101: Beyond doubt. What concerns me more is his motive for escaping unfettered to such a desolate wasteland.${prompt}
  9102: Listen to the two of you--dullarrrds to a fault.${prompt}
  9103: Stay your tongue, Lhe!${prompt}
  9104: Oh, please. There's nothing to be gained wrrringing your hands over the past.${prompt}
  9105: Riddle me this--the head of one of our twelve esteemed orders shirrrks his duties to go gallivanting in the forest and he ends up sleeping with the fishes.${prompt}
  9106: He's made a laughingstock out of all of us!${prompt}
  9107: Lhe, do you not think--${prompt}
  9108: He was a fool! He grew complacent, thinking Eastern Ulbuka safe and forgetting what it means to fear the forest!${prompt}
  9109: When Ygnas ordered colonization to commence, we all knew that there would be prrrices to be paid. Let there be no doubt--Melvien dug his own grave.${prompt}
  9110: So stop shedding tears for that morrron, or else we won't be able to move forward!${prompt}
  9111: Lhe's words may be verbal briars, but I find myself in total agreementaru.${prompt}
  9112: And Melvien supported colonization more than any of us, so the rumor-wumors going about town don't surprise me in the least!${prompt}
  9113: Rumors? What rumors?${prompt}
  9114: That Melvien's death was not a coincidence, but rather a carefully orchestrated plotaru by those opposed to our explorations on the continent.${prompt}
  9115: How dare you!? You waltz in here after contributing nothing for months, and have the gall to--${prompt}
  9116: Stop your whining, Gratzigg. I didn't say I'm a believer--just that hushed words and furtive glances are being exchanged in dank taverns and back alleys.${prompt}
  9117: <Sigh>${prompt}
  9118: Stop hemming and hawing, Margret. If you have something-womething to say, then out with it.${prompt}
  9119: Rumors are a vicious thing, Chero-Machero. Forgive me for thinking out loud, but...${prompt}
  9120: '...Couldn''t it also be that a radical faction of colonization supporters assassinated Melvien to cast aspersions on those opposed?${prompt}'
  9121: Unthinkable-winkable! Explain yourself!${prompt}
  9122: Melvien exerted a disproportionate amount of influence over those in his camp. None of us can deny it.${prompt}
  9123: He spent so much time and effort sending swords into the wild, is it so unthinkable that one found its way into his back?${prompt}
  9124: Whose side are you on, Margret? We've always counted on the Order of Haverton's support!${prompt}
  9125: This is not about political posturing. I'm simply ensuring that we're properly diligent in considering all perspectives.${prompt}
  9126: You disgust me. You are not “considering all perspectives,” just stirring the pot! This nation is divided enough without you deepening the rift.${prompt}
  9127: I've done nothing other than provide an alternative hypothesis. The only one who truly knows what happened is the man himself, and without further evidence we cannot but speculate.${prompt}
  9128: I'm surrre we all value your opinion.${prompt}
  9129: Get back to your books and leave the discussion to those more qualified.${prompt}
  9130: |-
    <Sigh>
    We had all our duck-wucks in a row, and something like this has to happen.${prompt}

  9133: But wait--that's not what matters here!${prompt}

  9144: So shove off to the Civic Arboretum and procure me some veggies!${prompt}
  9145: You don't know how much time you'd be saving m...err, just picture the look of gratitude on the princess's face!${prompt}
  9146: The princess has always been a connoisseurrr of fine vegetables. Surely fresh tomatoes will cheer her up.${prompt}
  9147: But wasn't that Fremilla's job...?${prompt}
  9148: ${name-player}! You came! Thank goodness Fremilla reached you in time.${prompt}
  9149: That strong landshiver caused some grave damage to various sections of Rala Waterways, and the Order of Renaye is in utter disarray.${prompt}
  9150: They claim, “the currents have shifted.”${prompt}
  9151: This cannot bode well.${prompt}
  9152: I wish I knew more, but I learned only the fundaments of geomancy from my tutors.${prompt}
  9153: Someone more versed in the issue from the Order of Renaye will be visiting the castle shortly, and I want you to be there with me.${prompt}
  9154: |-
    How do you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    The Order of Renaye?
    Of course I'll be there.${prompt}
  9155: Surely you are aware of their geomantic activities here in Ulbuka. The order's head and minister of education, Ikhi Askamot, will come to proffer her opinion.${prompt}
  9156: I felt a duty to accompany Ikhi to Leafallia in light of the events that transpired in Kamihr Drifts.${prompt}
  9157: Some things are easier to understand in person.${prompt}
  9158: Since that time, Ikhi has approached me with increasing frequency.${prompt}
  9159: She has always been a bit...well, I hesitate to say “standoffish,” because that implies a lack of concern...but she is a woman of few words.${prompt}
  9160: That makes approaching her a bit of a task, and one that I shied away from until recently--a failing of mine as one of the prominent faces of Adoulin.${prompt}
  9161: But ever since we met, I have learned so much. About myself, about the world...${prompt}
  9162: '...But we''ve no time for musings. Come. The council awaits.${prompt}'
  9163: This “meeting” better get underway soon. I don't trust my good-for-nothing suborrrdinates to even sweep the floors, let alone run things in my absence.${prompt}
  9164: Oh, Lhe, ever the sourpuss. Ikhi never would've called us here if she didn't have something important to say--and it may provide some juicy tidbits that will help you and yours.${prompt}
  9165: One can only hope.${prompt}
  9166: Ikhi, please. We are all interested in hearing your observations.${prompt}
  9167: I'm afraid the situation is grave. An area of the waterways...has collapsed.${prompt}
  9168: That landshiver-wiver sent my shelves tumbling to the ground, so it's not surprising that dilapidated cesspool would cave in. We'll just have to repair it. What's the problem?${prompt}
  9169: Just draw up a quick budgetaru and I'll hire some workers to get it patched up in no time.${prompt}
  9170: All things in this world are in flux. What once had form will return to dust. This is an immutable law of nature.${prompt}
  9171: We mustn't lay blame on things that break...it is the way of things.${prompt}
  9172: Huh? You're off flapping-wapping your gums, but all I hear is nonsense.${prompt}
  9173: C'mon, Ikhi--stop pretending to be all cryptic and mysterious, and say what you mean! You're the head of an order-worder, not a babbling doomsayer!${prompt}
  9174: I'm...I'm sorry.${prompt}
  9175: Argh! I'm not even that mad--I just want you to be more clear!${prompt}
  9176: Be direct and to the pointaru. We're all listening.${prompt}
  9177: Go on!${prompt}
  9178: Damn you, woman, out with it!${prompt}
  9179: |-
    How do you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    Make him shut up.
    Give him a kick to the rump.${prompt}
  9180: ${name-player}? Just what are you...?${prompt}
  9181: G-get away from me! Your hovering-wovering is making me ill!${prompt}
  9182: |-
    G-get away from--
    Mmph! Mmph!${prompt}
  9183: |-
    Stop cover-wovering my--
    Mmmmmmph!${prompt}
  9184: <Gurgle>${prompt}
  9185: Ikhi, are you trying to say that the Ergisade has been shattered?${prompt}
  9186: The Ergisade? Hildebert, I am not familiar with such a name.${prompt}
  9187: Forgive me, Arciela, for keeping its existence a secret from you.${prompt}
  9188: Ikhi, if I may?${prompt}
  9189: Arciela, surely you remember the plot to assassinate Ygnas that your pioneer companion managed to foil.${prompt}
  9190: Of course.${prompt}
  9191: When I saw that Ygnas had been transformed into that most curious form, I began to doubt that the catalyst was the curse of the founder king after all.${prompt}
  9192: I consider myself a lettered man, and happen to know a good deal about the events that transpired during the Great Expedition.${prompt}
  9193: August appeared before the king and the heads of each order in their dreams, beseeching them to cease making inroads into Ulbuka.${prompt}
  9194: This was but one of several incidents that spurred them to turn tail and seal themselves within the city walls.${prompt}
  9195: Not content with merely heeding the founder king's warning, Adoulin's ruler created a new grave in honor of August's memory deep within Rala Waterways.${prompt}
  9196: I trust all present are familiar with this part of the story.${prompt}
  9197: ${name-player}, you are not of our land. Do you need me to go over the details once more?${prompt}
  9198: |-
    Should Hildebert repeat his explanation?
    ${selection-lines}
    No need.
    Please. I didn't quite catch everything.${prompt}
  9199: Understood. But pay careful attention this time.${prompt}
  9200: '...Yet honoring August''s memories is but half of the truth.${prompt}'
  9201: Arciela, you are not the head of house, and hence have not been apprised of the full story. Yet I would be remiss to hide information from you as the future stands poised in the balance.${prompt}
  9202: Allow me to shed some light on the story and reveal to you the truth.${prompt}
  9203: ${name-player}, you should be privy to this as well. I am nothing if not pragmatic, but I cannot vouch for your future here should my words ever leave this hall.${prompt}
  9204: I would trust ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] with my life.${prompt}
  9205: Hildebert, your riddles rival those of Ikhi. What is this “half-truth” of which you speak?${prompt}
  9206: The shrine dedicated to August is more than just a memorial--it is a giant geomantic seal.${prompt}
  9207: A seal...containing the spirit of August himself?${prompt}
  9208: I am not versed in the particulars, but whether it be his spirit or his will, the fact remains that the founder king held great sway over the city long after his death.${prompt}
  9209: It loomed over the populace, threatening it with divine punishment should they not heed his warnings.${prompt}
  9210: As the Great Expedition progressed, pioneers reported seeing his form appearing before them. Though this phenomenon was originally denounced as hallucinations born from overwork, it was not long before an epidemic broke out among the populace.${prompt}
  9211: Ill fortune also befell the heads of the twelve orders, and the citizenry was paralyzed with fear of something they could feel, but not touch.${prompt}
  9212: The king of the age, vexed and nearly hysterical, turned the city itself into a barrier to ward off evil spirits.${prompt}
  9213: But how is such a thing even possible?${prompt}
  9214: He constructed waterways deep beneath the city. The citizenry was informed of naught but that they were to make life in Adoulin self-sustaining.${prompt}
  9215: That was merely a front. The waterways themselves are veins in a large magical apparatus flooded with geomantic energies.${prompt}
  9216: And, like most veins, the blood flows back to the heart--the grave of the founder king.${prompt}
  9217: (This must be the seal Morimar was referring to back in Kamihr Drifts.)${prompt}
  9218: The most storied geomancer of the time oversaw the project from commencement to completion, and even the slightest bends and the most miniscule differences in elevation were carefully planned out to draw geomantic wards around the city.${prompt}
  9219: And the very water itself, ostensibly for purposes of sustenance and irrigation, is in fact a physical means to carry forth spiritual energies.${prompt}
  9220: Their directionality, fixed for centuries, is of utmost import to the type of magic the wards compart. For years, they have served to divert harm from the city to the outside world.${prompt}
  9221: But why? August was the man who saw our great nation rise. Why would they fear one we owe so much to?${prompt}
  9222: Even though he may have brought great good upon our city, there is one undeniable fact--the only thing man fears more than that which he does not know is that which he knows only in part.${prompt}
  9223: Yet their caution appears to have been well placed. Up until now, no other calamity has befallen our land, and we have been content to live in peace for several centuries.${prompt}
  9224: And now...it's broken.${prompt}
  9225: Who cares!? If it broke-woke, then we fix it! I don't see any problem!${prompt}
  9226: The lot of you sit here chit-chattaruing and wringing your hands when there's progress to be made! No wonder it's taken us this long to get where we are!${prompt}
  9227: <Blink>${prompt}
  9228: What's with you people? Once we find the money-woney, it'll be a snap!${prompt}
  9229: Up and at 'em! Just spend some coin, hire a bunch of those pioneers to get on it, and--${prompt}
  9230: H-hey! Not again--!${prompt}
  9231: It's...it's not that simple.${prompt}
  9232: Whatever do you mean?${prompt}
  9233: The inscriptions have been overwritten.${prompt}
  9234: Overwritten!?${prompt}
  9235: Perhaps a visual aid will help.${prompt}
  9236: Take a look.${prompt}
  9237: This is a device my order refers to as a “crux.” Trained individuals can use it to read the currents of the lifestream. This particular device has been attuned to the Rala Waterways.${prompt}
  9238: Now...${prompt}
  9239: See how it is contorted? This means that the incantation...has been transposed into something else.${prompt}
  9240: |-
    But as to exactly how...
    That's something I can't tell without visiting the site directly.${prompt}
  9241: But, Ikhi, do you think that wise, with all the beasts lurking down there?${prompt}
  9242: Then your choice to call ${name-player} was a prudent one. ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] can go places we cannot.${prompt}
  9243: I wholeheartedly approve. ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] has proven ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] worth many times thus far.${prompt}
  9244: And further, what was discussed in this room must not be shared with others, and hence we can only trust one from this congregation.${prompt}
  9245: ${name-player}, your service to the city has been more than mere happenstance.${prompt}
  9246: Having Arciela vouch for you is proof beyond doubt.${prompt}
  9247: Then we are in accord.${prompt}
  9248: ${name-player}, we anxiously await your successful return.${prompt}
  9249: |-
    How do you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'll do all I can.
    I've no time for such nonsense.${prompt}
  9250: It is not nonsense, ${name-player}. The fate of Adoulin lies in the balance.${prompt}
  9251: The Twelve Orders have tasked you with surrrveying Rala Waterways?${prompt}
  9252: I would advise you to bring prrrotection. The recent landshivers may have loosened a few stones in the ceilings.${prompt}
  9253: ${name-player}, you made it back whole! With all that trekking and fighting, you must be positively exhausted, but I'm afraid we haven't much time.${prompt}
  9254: Please--what happened?${prompt}
  9255: Yes, we must know.${prompt}
  9256: The flow of water has changed?${prompt}
  9257: Wh-what!? An explosion and a bright flash of light? What on Vana'diel--!?${prompt}
  9258: 'And this is...${keyitem-article: 0[2]}? Then that huge shaking wasn''t a landshiver, but rather...${prompt}'
  9259: I was afraid of this...${prompt}
  9260: 'Arciela, it''s as I told you: the currents changed not of their own accord, but by the hand of another.${prompt}'
  9261: Every ripple, every breath...all worked in concert, forming a barrier that forestalled spirits of a most foul nature.${prompt}
  9262: A barrier to ward off evil?${prompt}
  9263: Exactly. It has served its purpose well. Yet Ygnas's transformation into a leafkin was not only the doing of the founder king--he surely had help from the World Tree.${prompt}
  9264: The founder king's grave is the heart of the barrier, both physically and aetherically. A force far beyond our comprehension has held the seal together.${prompt}
  9265: And the grander a force is, the more likely even the smallest of deviations will sow discord. The founder king's will has come under assault countless times, so it is no surprise that eventually part of it should yield...${prompt}
  9266: '...And the calamities that have begun to befall us are the direct result of this.${prompt}'
  9267: Yet what piques my curiosity most is that which ${name-player} found in the waterways.${prompt}
  9268: Changing the natural flow of water is like asking a tree to bend against the wind. But were the tree to be cut down instead...${prompt}
  9269: The explosion has caused the entire incantation to be overwritten. The protections placed over the city have begun to fade.${prompt}
  9270: But, if the incantation has changed...${prompt}
  9271: The question is, “What has it been changed to?”${prompt}
  9272: Sadly, my crux can only detect that it has changed.${prompt}
  9273: I surmise that the currents flowing from this world into the next, warding off various and sundry evils from passing through the ethereal barrier separating them, have been reversed.${prompt}
  9274: Reversed? Which means what, exactly?${prompt}
  9275: That which had warded now beckons.${prompt}
  9276: Its essence shielded all life from that which would wreak uncontrolled destruction, but now...it's but a matter of time before true terror is made manifest.${prompt}
  9277: In this corrupted, Stygian tide, the city will sink into the underworld...${prompt}
  9278: I speak, of course, of the incantation itself. No longer does it keep demons out--it draws them in.${prompt}
  9279: The city itself will soon be under assault. How long before it succumbs, I do not know.${prompt}
  9280: |-
    Any questions?
    ${selection-lines}
    So it now draws in monsters?
    What are you implying?${prompt}
  9281: Mayhaps my previous explanations were insufficient, but yes--that's exactly what it does.${prompt}
  9282: I hardly need spell out what this means for the future of our once-peaceful nation.${prompt}
  9283: But in the worst case...the city itself may be absorbed into another dimension.${prompt}
  9284: What!?${prompt}
  9285: The other orders will surely not believe these words wholesale, but someone must inform them of the danger and lead us to conquer the evil within.${prompt}
  9286: Yet, that task must fall to someone other than me.${prompt}
  9287: |-
    Arciela...
    You bore witness to all the events that have transpired in the forest. I can think of no other--both as a person and as the bloodline of the founder king.${prompt}
  9288: I suppose...${prompt}
  9289: I suppose you're right. I'll do all I can.${prompt}
  9290: Ikhi, I ask that you share with them the same tale you have just shared with us.${prompt}
  9291: Then it is decided. We'll convene a meeting of the twelve orders posthaste.${prompt}
  9292: We must make clear what really happened in the waterways...and Leafallia.${prompt}
  9293: ${name-player}, you've always given me the courage to go on. I'd like you to be present, too.${prompt}
  9294: |-
    Will you assist Arciela?
    ${selection-lines}
    Certainly.
    I would never disappoint you.${prompt}
  9295: Your response warms my heart.${prompt}
  9296: Then I must make the appropriate preparations...${prompt}
  9297: Of course. We must convince them, at any cost.${prompt}
  9298: ${name-player}, I have to get ready, too. Let's meet up here once everyone's set.${prompt}
  9299: Until then.${prompt}
  9300: Arciela has never called such a meeting of the Twelve Orders with such urrrgency.${prompt}
  9301: She has informed us that you are to be present. I'll purrrmit you entry once the heads have assembled.${prompt}
  9302: Who does that upstart think she is, summoning the heads of the Twelve Orders just to make us wait!?${prompt}
  9303: |-
    Indubitably-wubitably!
    We've more pressing matters to deal with than the whims of some young girl.${prompt}
  9304: And it's all because Melvien had to kick the bucketaru.${prompt}
  9305: Ugh, I can't believe we leaders have been reduced to mere paper-shuffle-wufflers.${prompt}
  9306: Thanks to his reckless antics, colonization's practically been slowed to a haltaru. If only he'd kept his nose stuck in his books, then we wouldn't be stuck in this bureaucratic-watic quagmire.${prompt}
  9307: Could you please be a little more considerate of the deceased?${prompt}
  9308: |-
    I...I was just saying what everyone was thinking. I don't see the harm in that.
    Plus, it's not like he'll rise from the grave to seek revenge because I hurtaru his feelings posthumously. ${prompt}
  9309: My apologies, everyone. I did not expect to take so long.${prompt}
  9310: I hope you do not intend to start the meeting on as short notice as you sent out those summons. Some of us still have yet to arrive!${prompt}
  9311: I have something to say that simply cannot wait. Please, the future of Adoulin lies in the balance!${prompt}
  9312: '...The future of Adoulin, you say?${prompt}'
  9313: I was under the impression you were only investigating what took place in the waterways.${prompt}
  9314: I was.${prompt}
  9315: Well, thank the Goddess that we dropped everything so this royal runtaru could waste our time with information on “Watergate.”${prompt}
  9316: Didn't you know Reginald and Amchuchu are already flexing their mental mightaru to come up with a solution for that? Anyway, on to something of substance-wubstance.${prompt}
  9317: Condition-witions in the hinterland are growing worse by the day.${prompt}
  9318: Heretofore unseen monstarus have been brazenly appearing before coalition staff even at high noon.${prompt}
  9319: Livestock go missing-wissing after the fences erected to protect them miraculously break.${prompt}
  9320: Whole fields of crops are supposedly withering overnightaru.${prompt}
  9321: Like rats from a sinking ship, the smaller beasts of the forest trample-wample each other in an effort to take refuge on the coast.${prompt}
  9322: Just what are they fleeing-weeing from?${prompt}
  9323: Could it possibly have something to do with the recentaru spate of landshivers?${prompt}
  9324: What an utterly terrifying prospect that is...${prompt}
  9325: As the person in charge of the colonization initiative, these issues seem much more prrressing than a little underground mishap.${prompt}
  9326: Say your piece, Arrrciela, but make it snappy.${prompt}
  9327: Then allow me to get right to the point.${prompt}
  9328: The tunnel collapse in the waterways and subsequent change in water flow down there was not the result of a landshiver.${prompt}
  9329: What sort of rrridiculousness are you hinting at?${prompt}
  9330: Care to elaborate for us, Ikhi?${prompt}
  9331: The waterways were attacked by a living person. Why? To rrreplace the geomancy within them.${prompt}
  9332: The divine magic that once safeguarrrded the area has been supplanted by evil sorcery.${prompt}
  9333: You mean to say that someone annulled the only entity keeping us from certain death!?${prompt}
  9334: There is no need for theatrics, Hildebert. Please, just calm down.${prompt}
  9335: Theatrics!?${prompt}
  9336: The last bulwark against the overpowering thaumaturgical forces slobbering at our gates just fell and you accuse me of “theatrics”!?${prompt}
  9337: Ikhi says the Ergisade has been supplanted by another form of magic, meaning that it has vanished completely!${prompt}
  9338: For all intents and purposes, we have reverted to the age of the Great Expedition!${prompt}
  9339: The curse of the founder king shall descend upon Adoulin once more...${prompt}
  9340: |-
    Our thriving society will be utterly ruined!
    If only we had not begun raping the land by trying to colonize it.${prompt}
  9341: |-
    I scoff-woff in your general direction, Hildebert.
    If we had a pinch of bayld for every hole in your logic, we could build a new waterway out of solid gold!${prompt}
  9342: Besides, who cares if some musty superstition's no longer sealed away? I know I'm not afraid of any evil spiritaru.${prompt}
  9343: Even if I were, though, you could simply deploy your vastaru army of Weatherspoon exorcists and hocus-pocus it away!${prompt}
  9344: You could hold a grand-scale Wake of the Lilies and curry-wurry pioneer support as well!${prompt}
  9345: Hey, how about chantaruing a ritualistic phrase like “The power of Altana compels you” to get people more involved?${prompt}
  9346: Yes, and I'll have the Ministry of Commerce sponsor vendors. We'll all be swimming-wimming in bayld!${prompt}
  9347: You know not of what you speak, Chero-Machero!${prompt}
  9348: At least I know what I ate this morning, you old fartaru!${prompt}
  9349: Calling our founding father an “evil spirit” to “hocus-pocus” away is an affront to our whole civilization!${prompt}
  9350: Pardon my naiveté. I didn't realize I had free reign to curse-wurse my own people as long as I founded their home millennia ago!${prompt}
  9351: Even the village idiotaru knows that someone who harms an entire city should be considered evil!${prompt}
  9352: I beg of you. Do not let your emotions get the better of you.${prompt}
  9353: There is something I must s--${prompt}
  9354: World-shattaruing news, everyone!${prompt}
  9355: Reginald and I just returned from surveying the damage in Rala Waterways and made a startling discovery-wovery!${prompt}
  9356: Those walls didn't come crumbling-wumbling down because of a landshiver!${prompt}
  9357: |-
    You may need to take a seataru for this!${wait-36: 1}
    They fell at the hands of a living being!${prompt}
  9358: Isn't this the most shock-wocking news of your lives!?${prompt}
  9359: '...Apparently not? But why!? I''m positively befuddle-wuddled.${prompt}'
  9360: Because Ikhi just got done telling us the same thing. You were close, though.${prompt}
  9361: Awww, but close only countarus in On the Dot and hand grenades.${prompt}
  9362: How about this juicy-wuicy bit of intelligence, then?${prompt}
  9363: The explosive-wosive used was so ancient, as far as I know, the only person who'd have the knowledge to build it is Melvien.${prompt}
  9364: What did you say!?${prompt}
  9365: I said the design was ancientaru. In other words, really old.${prompt}
  9366: No, not that! The part where you implied Melvien built it.${prompt}
  9367: Ah, yes. The distinguishing characteristic is the fuse. From what I gleaned, it looks as if one can set the time at which the device detonatarus.${prompt}
  9368: The technology employed dates back to the great war that raged long ago. I remember him showing me a diagram-wiagram of it in his notebook, and the remains of this one match it perfectly.${prompt}
  9369: As I have never seen one in these lands before, I postulataru that Melvien was intimately acquainted with its workings...but this doesn't come as a surprise either, does it?${prompt}
  9370: You people are no fun-wun at--${prompt}
  9371: What was that!?${prompt}
  9372: What do you suppose this means for us?${prompt}
  9373: '...Ummm, sorry to barge in on your tipitty-top secret conversation, but...${prompt}'
  9374: Isn't there something...uh...off about all this?${prompt}
  9375: What would a lowly servant know of critical analysis? It is hardly your place to sp--${prompt}
  9376: I think we all know that Melvien's gone to the big treasury in the sky, tee hee.${prompt}
  9377: But if that's true, how could he have made the bomb go boom-boom? I think it's downright mean and rude to frame someone when he can't defend himself!${prompt}
  9378: Wait a second! I never said anything about him being the culpritaru. Besides--${prompt}
  9379: Shhh! I'm trying to think!${prompt}
  9380: Eureka! My muse has inspired me!${prompt}
  9381: I know who did it!${prompt}
  9382: Now you listen-wisten here, you--${prompt}
  9383: |-
    Wait, you know who did it?
    This I simply mustaru hear. Please, humor us.${prompt}
  9384: Okay! The culvert is...
  9385: A topic we'll talk about later!${prompt}
  9386: Being in front of you all has given me a case of the tummy twitherym. I need some fresh air...${prompt}
  9387: Or maybe some dessert?${prompt}
  9388: I could really go for something sweet after using all that brainpower!${prompt}
  9389: Why's everyone so quiet?${prompt}
  9390: |-
    Or, an even better question.
    Is Melvien really dead?${prompt}
  9391: Did you search every itty-bitty nook and cranny of his body to make sure?${prompt}
  9392: I, Fremilla, the legendary sleuth of Adoulin, will answer what all you inquiring minds wish to know!${prompt}
  9393: And that is the name of the percolator!${prompt}
  9394: |-
    Which is...${wait-36: 1}
    Wait for it...${prompt}

    Melvien!
    His crime? Being too handsome!${prompt}
  9396: His chiseled jaw and burning passion for life are enough to make any woman die of longing!${prompt}
  9397: Tee hee hee.${prompt}
  9398: Ah, yes, death--the savior of all, release from constant suffering.${prompt}
  9399: I can barely contain myself thinking of all the fun we're going to have together...bweeheehee.${prompt}
  9400: Bwahahahahahaha!${prompt}
  9401: ${name-player}, you don't think this means...${prompt}
  9402: I have had it up to here with your nonsensical japes! This is not a schoolyard, but a seat of government!${prompt}
  9403: If you are unwilling to contribute to the discourse, then remove--
  9404: Mwrf!?${prompt}
  9405: I don't think I'm finished yet, Gramps. In fact, I'm just getting started.${prompt}
  9406: Why don't you take a seat?☆
  9407: |-
    ...Hm? Why's everyone getting cold feet?
    This is the part where things really heat up.${prompt}
  9408: '...H...Hildebert!?${prompt}'
  9409: Nice cadenza, my dear Svenja.♪${prompt}
  9410: I'd like nothing more than to move to a canto at this point, but I fear we've already reached the coda.${prompt}
  9411: You're all unbearable idiots.${prompt}
  9412: Talk about melodrama! You all constantly squabble over the most trivial of things.${prompt}
  9413: And everyone's content to play King Diddly of the Squat Islets.${prompt}
  9414: Then there's this whole inner struggle over colonization. To be for it or against it? It's certainly a dumb question when nothing ever gets accomplished.${prompt}
  9415: The Twelve Orders?${prompt}
  9416: |-
    More like the Twelve Disorders!
    At best, you're a disease that's slowly killing the nation.${prompt}
  9417: Hm?
  9418: Whoopsie.
  9419: Maybe I got a bit out of character.☆
  9420: Oh, well, you were all bound to find out eventually. Let's lift the curtain on this climax!${prompt}
  9421: What the...!?${prompt}
  9422: Fremilla!?
  9423: Greetings, leaders of the Twelve Orders.
  9424: My name is Balamor, but you may know me by other fantastical names such as “The Deathborne Xol.”${prompt}
  9425: Dead born what? Zall? Sounds like a ridiculous villain made up by a Galka youngling-woungling!${prompt}
  9426: However, I'm playing only a supporting role. Let's all give a standing ovation to the antihero of this moving tragedy!
  9427: But...how!?${prompt}
  9428: |-
    A demon...in the castle!?
    ...What is this city...coming to...?${prompt}
  9429: Melvien!${prompt}
  9430: I assume all of you are present?${prompt}
  9431: |-
    Why, hello there, Arciela.
    How nice to know that you made it back in one piece.${prompt}
  9432: Heh heh, but it seems that you have not been completely honest with them.${prompt}
  9433: Do they understand the extent of the horrors that took place in that village deep within the jungle?${prompt}
  9434: Do they understand the extent to which that friend of yours was involved?${prompt}
  9435: And do they understand exactly what you did to me?${prompt}
  9436: You're one to talk!${prompt}
  9437: I advise you not to employ intellectually dishonest tactics here. They will only serve to further tighten the noose around your neck.${prompt}
  9438: The more you try to conceal facts, the more seeds of curiosity you sow. Eventually those seeds will sprout and bear the fruit of dissent. You had best repent before you are forced to eat the ire of every other order leader here.${prompt}
  9439: Although it pains me to say so, I have preparations to which I must attend.${prompt}
  9440: Fare thee well, and may you all be able to play nice for a tad bit longer.${prompt}
  9441: Pweh heh heh, that was a rather staccato intermezzo.${prompt}
  9442: I guess I should take a bow and head offstage as well. I wouldn't want to leave you thinking I'm a mere extra in this production, though.${prompt}
  9443: Therefore, why don't I give you something to remember me by?♪${prompt}
  9444: |-
    Oh, that reminds me. I heard something about...what was it called again?
    Ah, the “curse of the founder king.”${prompt}
  9445: Apparently, all your ancestors who ignored the king's dying words met with unfortunate ends. Now that's the kind of story that jingles my bells.${prompt}
  9446: You are a wanton degenerate if that brings you any sort of joy!${prompt}
  9447: In due time, you'll all be ballyhooing like when colonization was given the boot.${prompt}
  9448: What kind of a farce-warce is this?${prompt}
  9449: Nothing's differentaru at all.${prompt}
  9450: No need to rush. I said “in due time,” remember?${prompt}
  9451: But maybe the dress rehearsal's already begun in some places.${prompt}
  9452: The figurative big top that once protected you is no more. You're as naked as the day your people first set foot upon these shores.${prompt}
  9453: Now that you're exposed to the elements, there's nothing to stop my little spell from raining down upon you. Its droplets will turn to buckets and then to torrents, leaving everyone you've ever held dear to drown.${prompt}
  9454: Pwehehe, I can already hear your screams of terror.
  9455: They're like an encore call to my ears.${prompt}
  9456: Of course, you won't enjoy it nearly as much as I will.${prompt}
  9457: Oh, that's my cue. Time to exit stage right.${prompt}
  9458: |-
    There is a way for you to remove the curse, though.
    I'll be more than happy to divulge it...if you can find me.${prompt}
  9459: Now to begin this game of hide-and-seek. Ready or not, here I go!${prompt}
  9460: Bwahahaha!
  9461: Fremilla? Fremilla!?${prompt}
  9462: A...Arci...ela...?${prompt}
  9463: |-
    I don't know what to do, ${name-player}!
    Fremilla's not opening her eyes!${prompt}
  9464: Just what have the Peacekeepers been doing this whole time, anyway!? Spit shining their bootarus!?${prompt}
  9465: And, Ikhi, how could you let that magic-wagic force veiling the city get destroyed!?${prompt}
  9466: Incompetentarus, the both of you. Why do we even suffer your presence in these discussions?${prompt}
  9467: Are you trying to start something, furball!?${prompt}
  9468: All you do is put others down to build yourself up. You don't give a damn about this city's policies unless they make you bayld!${prompt}
  9469: Pffft, a weak argumentaru made by an equally weak mind.${prompt}
  9470: I'm just telling it like it is. Face the truth and stop getting your britches in a bundle-wundle over it!${prompt}
  9471: Rrrelax and take a deep breath, you two!${prompt}
  9472: How're we supposed to be relaxed? Did you not just see that phantasm!?${prompt}
  9473: Some good that Ergistupid thing is!${prompt}
  9474: And what in the Goddess's name was Melvien talking about, Arciela?${prompt}
  9475: Indeed. We would be most appreciative if you would tell us the truth.${prompt}
  9476: Although, I am certain the whole thing is a plot by the pro-colonization faction to sully the integrity of those willing to uphold the founder king's wishes!${prompt}
  9477: If you keep proposing ridiculous theories like that, Hildebert, I might actually start believing Chero-Machero's claim that you're senile.${prompt}
  9478: No one asked for your opinion, conspirator! The rotten rhetoric your kind spews forth does nothing but breed lies and deception!${prompt}
  9479: Such is made all the more apparent now that we know Melvien lives.${prompt}
  9480: Surely my theory is far less absurd than the blatant falsehoods this girl has been feeding us--${prompt}
  9481: Enough already!${prompt}
  9482: Do none of you realize what just happened right in front you!?
  9483: Be adults and act your age for once!${prompt}
  9484: Who cares about your stance on the colonization movement!? This is much bigger than that!${prompt}
  9485: Now's the time to put aside our differences for the good of the nation!${prompt}
  9486: Yet all you can do is sling mud at each other like prehistoric brutes!${prompt}
  9487: Look at the big picture!
  9488: What's the purpose of our Twelve Orders?${prompt}
  9489: I've always thought it was to protect the people, but apparently you think it's to grab more power for yourselves!${prompt}
  9490: You completely ignore the blight in the jungle, pawning off the responsibility on pioneers.${prompt}
  9491: You each take credit for the movement's victories and blame others for its failures!${prompt}
  9492: I can't take any more of this useless bickering. Ruin is staring us right in the face, yet you're only looking for personal gain. Frankly, it's pathetic!${prompt}
  9493: Shut your damned mouth, wench!
  9494: What would a mere child know of governing a city-state? It takes more than lofty ideals and good intentions to keep a nation functioning!${prompt}
  9495: I have remained silent about your improper behavior in deference to the chancellor, but I see little reason to do so if this is how you plan to act in his stead.${prompt}
  9496: Do you think your royal lineage grants you innate asylum from our skepticism!?${prompt}
  9497: Anyone with half a head on their shoulders would doubt the veracity of the claims you make. A talking dragon!? A clandestine village hidden in the shadow of Mount Kamihr!? Fie, I say!${prompt}
  9498: |-
    My sentimentarus exactly.
    I don't know how you were able to win Ikhi's respect, but I doubt even half the people here believe your cockamamie-wamie stories.${prompt}
  9499: However, what Melvien said is a much more crucial-wucial subject. What do you think he needs to make preparations for?${prompt}
  9500: And how'd he manage to fake his own death? Can you imagine going to that extentaru just for a prank--${prompt}
  9501: D-don't think you can scare-ware me with a dirty lo--${prompt}
  9502: '...What?${prompt}'
  9503: What're you doing, you idiotaru?${prompt}
  9504: Out of the way.${prompt}
  9505: He's...not breathing...${prompt}
  9506: You're joking, rightaru...?${prompt}
  9507: I wish I were.${prompt}
  9508: No, you can't be serious-werious...${prompt}
  9509: Of all the...${prompt}
  9510: First that phantasm appears in the castle...${prompt}
  9511: Now Chero-Machero inexplicably collapses...${prompt}
  9512: |-
    And let us not forget about Melvien's return from the dead.
    All of this...${prompt}
  9513: '...is entirely your doing!${prompt}'
  9514: I can see why you are sometimes called the Wildborn Witch. You definitely seem to care more about the jungle than the Sacred City.${prompt}
  9515: Exactly what is your plan for engendering the downfall of our society, you evil enchantress?${prompt}
  9516: Stop rrright there, white whiskers.${prompt}
  9517: What's all this caterwauling for?${prompt}
  9518: You're a grrrown Elvaan. Don't get so hot under the collar just because a maiden got caught up in the moment.${prompt}
  9519: It's not like she has some kind of deathgaze or anything. There's no way she could send him rrreeling with a single look.${prompt}
  9520: Hmph...${prompt}
  9521: And you, Arciela. There's usually a time and a place for everything, but not for that phrrrasing.${prompt}
  9522: Exactly. Should a riot have started, it would've been all your fault.${prompt}
  9523: Stuff it, Grrratzigg! Don't add fuel to the fire!${prompt}
  9524: I officially declare this meeting adjourned. Return to your respective orders and take stock of the situation there.${prompt}
  9525: Arciela, I assume you erupted like that because you have been through so much recently. Perhaps a rest would do you some good.${prompt}
  9526: Ugh, what a strrressful day...${prompt}
  9527: ${name-player}, you're prrrobably due for a catnap, too.${prompt}
  9528: |-
    What!? Frrremilla!?
    I'm at a loss for words!${prompt}
  9529: If only I could do something to help besides stand guarrrd over the castle.... Either way, there is sadly nothing you can do here at the moment.${prompt}
  9530: |-
    Start from where?
    ${selection-lines}
    The beginning.
    Amchuchu.
    Everyone's angry.${prompt}
  9531: Mistress Arciela refuses to take any of her meals.${prompt}
  9532: No matter what tactics we employ, we simply cannot get her to leave her chambers. I fear that perhaps the best course of action is to simply leave her be.${prompt}
  9533: Master...Ygnas?${prompt}
  9534: ${name-player}...give...heirloom...necklace.${prompt}
  9535: |-
    You want me to...
    ${selection-lines}
    Give back the necklace?
    Do what with what?${prompt}
  9536: |-
    Yes.
    Must...have.
    ...Please.${prompt}
  9537: Bring...me...Adou...lin...necklace.${prompt}
  9538: Those soft eyes, that round figure, those rustling leaves...he is cuteness incarnate.${prompt}
  9539: Looking as woefully wretched as ever, I see.${prompt}
  9540: |-
    How will you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    Is there something you want to discuss?
    What brings you here?${prompt}
  9541: Not with a maggot like you!${prompt}
  9542: Last time I checked, I was a citizen of Adoulin. I do not believe I need Your Highness's holy permission to walk about my own city.${prompt}
  9543: I heard about the princess, and I think it is plain pathetic. Where did the dignity and perseverance she showed in Kamihr Drifts go!?${prompt}
  9544: Arciela should know by now that life isn't all giggles and sunshine. She needs to treat this as a test of will.${prompt}
  9545: However, I understand how her emotions could get the best of her after all she's been through.${prompt}
  9546: She is a young and passionate idealist, yet has been ostracized by the council members. All the while, misfortune bombards her homeland from every direction. That is enough to take the wind out of anyone's sails.${prompt}
  9547: And that is where you might as well come in!${prompt}
  9548: Stop being a chigoe on the wall and actually do some good for once. Show her that she is not alone in this chaos.${prompt}
  9549: Make her heart burn with fervor once more!${prompt}
  9550: That task will be a daunting one to complete, considering her current mental state...and that <cough> I could not <cough>.${prompt}
  9551: '...${prompt}'
  9552: |-
    Ugh, cut me some slack!
    I knew you were daft, but now I have to question whether or not you are even sentient! Let me spell it out for you.${prompt}
  9553: Give...Arciela...--are you following me?--something...she...likes!${prompt}
  9554: Talking with you always leaves me drained. I shall be going before I catch whatever form of stupidity afflicts you.${prompt}
  9555: '${color-alt: 121}Only one of the following can be traded. Please throw away any excess ones: ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${item-singular: 1[2]}, ${item-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  9556: Ah, ${name-player}. Cynthia entrrrusted me with a message for you.${prompt}
  9557: It rrreads, “Please bring the heirloom necklace that Master Ygnas mentioned.”${prompt}
  9558: I think it would be easiest if you just hand overrr the necklace to me, and I shall pass it on to Cynthia.${prompt}
  9559: I await your rrreturn.${prompt}
  9560: 'Yes, this ${item-singular: 0[2]} does look to be the keepsake they rrrequested.${prompt}'
  9561: Could this be the necklace you're rrreferring to, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  9562: |-
    A kind citizen came to turrrn this in.
    It's adorned with the Order of Adoulin's insignia, so I figured you'd be looking for it and took it off his hands.${prompt}
  9563: Please be a bit more attentive the next time you're entrrrusted with something from then Adoulins. This is a precious heirloom, after all.${prompt}
  9564: All's well that ends well, I suppose. I'll brrring the necklace to Cynthia, so you're free to do whatever you please.${prompt}
  9565: Mistress Arciela requests an audience with you. I wish you all the best.${prompt}
  9566: |-
    What will you say to her?
    ${selection-lines}
    ...Are you all right?
    Arciela...?${prompt}
  9567: '...${prompt}'
  9568: '...After the council dispersed, reports began flooding in. Each detailed how certain people involved with the Twelve Orders had met with some grave misfortune...just like that lunatic jester predicted!${prompt}'
  9569: Worst of all...Tiana was one of them.${prompt}
  9570: I made a promise when the World Tree was resurrected that I wouldn't cry ever again...but I've already broken it.${prompt}
  9571: |-
    I'm sorry...I just couldn't take it anymore.
    The shock was too much for someone as weak as me...${prompt}
  9572: I thought I knew the jungle inside and out, but I didn't know a single thing about it.${prompt}
  9573: I can't even tell good from evil anymore, partly because there's evil in me. I said some horrible things at the assembly, but they weren't just a way of calling attention to the problem...I truly meant them.${prompt}
  9574: All my life, they've called me a witch behind my back, but I've never felt it. Not until now.${prompt}
  9575: |-
    Those sprites risked their lives for me, but...to tell the truth, it was all in vain.
    I'm not worth protecting.${prompt}
  9576: Because of me...Fremilla...${prompt}
  9577: ${name-player}... It's only a matter of time before you fall to my curse, too. Get away while you still can.${prompt}
  9578: |-
    How will you console her?
    ${selection-lines}
    You did the best you could.
    You're not weak in the least.
    This isn't the Arciela I know.${prompt}
  9579: |-
    That's the thing... I didn't.
    All I did was foul things up.${prompt}
  9580: |-
    Yes, I am.
    None of this would've happened if I were stronger...${prompt}
  9581: |-
    Any words of encouragement?
    ${selection-lines}
    You're not alone in this.
    Nothing will happen to me.
    I think that we're all weak.${prompt}
  9582: But...if you stick by me...you'll surely...${prompt}
  9583: How can you be so sure?${prompt}
  9584: I know I said that on Mount Kamihr, but...${prompt}
  9585: '...I appreciate your kind words. Still, I...'
  9586: I can't help but think that if only...${prompt}
  9587: If only I'd died in the jungle back then!${prompt}

    Anything to add?
    ${selection-lines}
    Let's look for Balamor.
    It's time to go settle the score.${prompt}
  9597: But...how can we believe anything that raving jester's said? Even if you find him, he might not help at all...${prompt}
  9598: |-
    Your rebuttal?
    ${selection-lines}
    Doing nothing will help us even less.
    We're going to undo that curse!${prompt}
  9599: |-
    ...I guess you're right.
    Plus, it's obvious that thing's involved with Melvien somehow.${prompt}
  9600: We're the only ones we can trust--no, the only ones who can do anything about this.${prompt}
  9601: I can't argue with that!${prompt}
  9602: According to Svenja, everyone who succumbed to this curse has exhibited the same inexplicable symptoms...${prompt}
  9603: Though it looks like they are dead at first glance, the Order of Janniston speculates that their souls have been removed.${prompt}
  9604: While of course she didn't mention a time frame, I can't imagine people would last long in that condition.${prompt}
  9605: We have to release Adoulin from this terror as soon as possible! We've not a minute to spare!${prompt}
  9606: In the name of all we hold dear, I'll leave my doubts behind and dive into the heart of darkness!${prompt}

    That's the spirit!
    Of course.${prompt}
  9609: Great!${prompt}
  9610: |-
    What?
    A gift...?${prompt}
  9611: Oh, you!
  9612: Of all the things to give me, you pick this!?${prompt}
  9613: You're simply...
  9614: '...too good to me.${prompt}'
  9615: |-
    ${name-player}, you're truly an extraordinary person.
    At first, I only thought it'd be funny if our paths crossed once more.${prompt}
  9616: I had no idea we'd be close at all.${prompt}
  9617: '...Sorry if that sounded cold. It''s just that I''ve never been able to expect much from anyone before.${prompt}'
  9618: That's why I was so glad I could see you again at the banquet. Once we were reunited there, I thought that just maybe the wheels of something great had been set in motion.${prompt}
  9619: I would've been more acknowledging if I weren't in front of eleven of the most important figures in the city. But now, I feel comfortable enough to say...${prompt}
  9620: Thanks for all you've done for me, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9621: I'm done living in fear of what could have been!${prompt}

  9625: |-
    He's still breathing.
    Goodness gracious, he always pushes himself too hard.${prompt}
  9626: I know my brother could barely get across what he wanted, but it sounded like Balamor should be in the founder king's tomb within Rala Waterways.${prompt}
  9627: Let's go and show him that whoever laughs last laughs loudest!${prompt}
  9628: I believe the prrrincess has headed to her ancestor's grave in the waterways.${prompt}
  9629: I strrrongly disagree with her going down there alone, but who am I to stop her? Keep her safe for the good of the nation, pioneer!${prompt}
  9630: You were nice enough to return this to us while I was up in my room wallowing in self-pity.${prompt}
  9631: You do remember it, don't you?${prompt}
  9632: |-
    Heir...loom.
    Brimming...with...power.${prompt}
  9633: Even I can see that...or sense it, anyway. A force unlike anything I have felt before now resides within this necklace.${prompt}
  9634: I'm sure its new properties will prove more than useful in our upcoming battle, and there's no one else more deserving of its enhanced facets than you.${prompt}
  9635: Please, I beg you to take it.${prompt}
  9636: |-
    Which would you like?

  9637: Oh, sorry about that. I don't think I could make a decision either if someone shoved them all in my face like that and told me to choose.${prompt}

    And how will I achieve this feat?

  9650: I have specific instrrructions not to let any without proper authorization pass.${prompt}

    How do you react?
    ${selection-lines}
    “Proper authorization”?
    I just want to see Arciela.${prompt}

  9653: '...You must leave.${prompt}'
  9654: ${name-player}! Don't go just yet.${prompt}
  9655: I had to go through the official scrrript back there, but I've something for you...from the princess.${prompt}
  9656: Dark days may lie ahead for Adoulin...but I've watched the prrrincess grow from babe to young woman...and know you can help her now more than any of us.${prompt}
  9657: Please...we're counting on you.${prompt}
  9658: 'Please, take a good look at the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} I handed you...and stay by Arciela''s side.${prompt}'
  9659: You may prrroceed.${prompt}
  9660: Purrrmission?${prompt}
  9661: There is no need of any special permission. I was made awarrre that you were coming.${prompt}
  9662: Please.${prompt}
  9663: ${name-player}, you've come.${prompt}
  9664: Just how many times have you been to this room so we could ponder our next step?${prompt}
  9665: I think I've lost count...but maybe I should've tried harder to remember.${prompt}
  9666: That? It's a glass of vegetable juice.${prompt}
  9667: Grennith made it for me from the bunch brought in this morning.${prompt}
  9668: And who do you think delivered them directly from the Civic Arboretum? Why, Chalvava herself.${prompt}
  9669: Would you like a sip?${prompt}
  9670: The main ingredient is, of course, Adoulinian tomatoes, but it also contains a hint of some other fruits and vegetables.${prompt}
  9671: How is it?${prompt}
  9672: |-
    What is your frank opinion?
    ${selection-lines}
    It's really sweet.
    Ugh!
    Eew...now I've got cooties.${prompt}
  9673: ${name-player}!? Are you all right!?${prompt}
  9674: ${name-player}...${prompt}
  9675: You don't want to know what'll happen if you say I poisoned it.${prompt}
  9676: |-
    How do you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    You poisoned it.
    I was just playing around.
    <Mutter>${prompt}
  9677: |-
    You're so cruel!
    And besides, if I poisoned it, wouldn't I be keeled over on the bed!?${prompt}
  9678: |-
    <Sigh>
    There's no helping you, is there?${prompt}
  9679: Hmm? What did you say?${prompt}
  9680: |-
    What do you have to say for yourself?
    ${selection-lines}
    ...I was just playing around.
    Play the fool.
    Say nothing.${prompt}
  9681: |-
    <Sigh>
    There's no helping you, is there?${prompt}
  9682: Huh?
  9683: Wh-what are you implying!?
  9684: I h-haven't even touched the thing, other than to put it down when Grennith brought it!
  9685: I'm asking you how it tastes, not...not...!${prompt}
  9686: It is, don't you think?${prompt}
  9687: Though the arboretum is still small and the Inventors' Coalition still has work to do, the bounty tastes as sweet as the finest imported honey.${prompt}
  9688: Young stalks brought from the forest are planted and grow, producing the food that will sustain future generations.${prompt}
  9689: But the fear of the forest is deeply ingrained within Adoulin, and many still view anything originating there with trepidation.${prompt}
  9690: I can only hope that in time people will begin to realize what the forest can provide us if we pay it the proper respect.${prompt}
  9691: And even when I grow old, I'll never forget the taste of this juice today.${prompt}
  9692: I'm glad I was here to share it with you.${prompt}
  9693: |-
    <Cough>
    But there're other things I remember just as clearly.${prompt}
  9694: Oh yes, don't think I'll let you off that easily.${prompt}
  9695: I can still feel the heat of your hand...${prompt}
  9696: '...When you struck me across the cheek. Though I knew there was a true sense of care and concern behind your actions.${prompt}'
  9697: You showed me the way.${prompt}
  9698: At least, that's how I like to think of it.${prompt}
  9699: |-
    Anything to say?
    ${selection-lines}
    Does it still hurt?
    Was I too forceful?
    I'm so sorry.${prompt}
  9700: Yes, it still stings.${prompt}
  9701: Like I fell on top of a nest of wasps!${prompt}
  9702: You were.${prompt}
  9703: I can't believe you would raise your hand in anger.${prompt}
  9704: What would you do if I said some things can't be forgiven?${prompt}
  9705: Hehe, I'm just pulling your tail.${prompt}
  9706: Consider it payback!${prompt}
  9707: You know, ${name-player}...${prompt}
  9708: I felt this strange tingling when we first met. I don't want to call it a premonition because that would be too grandiose, but...I knew something was going to happen.${prompt}
  9709: You swept through Adoulin like the wind, touching all you passed by.${prompt}
  9710: |-
    How do you react?
    ${selection-lines}
    “Like the wind”?
    Say nothing.${prompt}
  9711: Yes, the wind.${prompt}
  9712: Now I see why. The winds you brought were those of change.${prompt}
  9713: I...no, all of Adoulin had stagnated.${prompt}
  9714: All that appeared before us, all that was occurring in the forest...we turned our faces from it.${prompt}
  9715: We never realized that Yggdrasil was dying. We never realized that the Serpentine Labyrinth was arising anew.${prompt}
  9716: The old proverb mentions that there is always calm before the storm, but your winds helped us weather all that was to come.${prompt}
  9717: It started out with a breeze, with leaves fluttering gently, but slowly you started pushing us forward, helping us to walk step-by-step toward the herculean tasks that lay before us.${prompt}
  9718: And for that I will always be grateful.${prompt}
  9719: Do you remember that conversation we had some weeks ago?${prompt}
  9720: I said that even though we are all weak, we become stronger to protect those we love.${prompt}
  9721: That humanity isn't strong, and oftentimes we can only hope for miracles to occur...and those miracles in turn inspire us to become greater.${prompt}
  9722: I always believed that to be true.${prompt}
  9723: But surely I'm not the only one.${prompt}
  9724: All that live in the forest...the Naakuals, those precocious sprites, the leafkin...${prompt}
  9725: And likely even those beasts who sought to impede your progress...even they...even they...${prompt}
  9726: ${name-player}...thank you.${prompt}
  9727: You've sheltered us all. The city, the jungle...${prompt}
  9728: '...me...${prompt}'
  9729: ${name-player}...${prompt}
  9730: When I look inward and think of you, I...${prompt}
  9731: '...${prompt}'
  9732: Yes? What is it?${prompt}
  9733: Lady Arciela, the heads of the twelve orders request your presence in the Great Hall to discuss a matter most urgent.${prompt}
  9734: |-
    I see.
    I'll head there shortly, Grennith.${prompt}
  9735: Thank you.${prompt}
  9736: Forgive me, Arciela, but they insist that you hurry.${prompt}
  9737: I haven't yet made my peace with them after those harsh words we exchanged.${prompt}
  9738: The situation had taken a turn for the worse, and I could never find the time to...${prompt}
  9739: '...No. I will stop making excuses.${prompt}'
  9740: This is yet another obstacle I must confront.${prompt}
  9741: I...I don't...${prompt}
  9742: '...${prompt}'
  9743: Hildebert, I...${prompt}
  9744: |-
    Arciela...
    We stand before you today knowing that we have earned all the ire you threw at us.${prompt}
  9745: You were in the right.${prompt}
  9746: Hildebert...?${prompt}
  9747: We were consumed by our struggle for power, squabbling over trivialities while the people begged for succor.${prompt}
  9748: How had we fallen so far from grace, when we were once united in our goal of bringing splendor to our fair nation?${prompt}
  9749: But any reason I give you would just ring hollow.${prompt}
  9750: And I am more responsible for it than anyone in this hall.${prompt}
  9751: When you spoke to us frankly, with a clear mind and a heart free of deceit, I turned on you as a shark sensing blood in the water.${prompt}
  9752: And in my rage, I spewed such filth as cannot possibly be forgiven.${prompt}
  9753: Would that I could take it back, but so doing would not mend the wounds I have inflicted.${prompt}
  9754: Though it makes not the slightest onz of difference, I offer my sincerest apologies.${prompt}
  9755: Arciela...I am deeply sorry.${prompt}
  9756: So, uh... Hi, Arciela.${prompt}
  9757: Chero-Machero?${prompt}
  9758: Surely does beat-weat all, doesn't it?${prompt}
  9759: '...You aren''t the tiniestaru bit surprised?${prompt}'
  9760: Well, you're no fun.${prompt}
  9761: Surely you saw the thousand rays of golden lightaru shining down a little while ago?${prompt}
  9762: It was the World Tree...${prompt}
  9763: The World Tree, huh?${prompt}
  9764: Well, be that as it may, the light came streaming-weaming through the air, and before you know it this fool was bouncing off the walls.${prompt}
  9765: And the whole time, he kept babbling-wabbling a bunch of nonsense.${prompt}
  9766: “I saw the true nature-wature of things!”${prompt}
  9767: It's not nonsense, you pea-brained idiotaru! The truth of everything lay before me like an open book!${prompt}
  9768: Yeah, yeah, I'm sure Altana blessed you with a holy prophetic vision. I'll condescend to hear your little tale later, so shutaru your trap.${prompt}
  9769: And if this dunderhead managed-wanaged to come to, you can figure out what happened next.${prompt}
  9770: Do you mean...?${prompt}
  9771: Sure do.${prompt}
  9772: All those in the fair city-wity who dropped unconscious, be they of the twelve orders or not, popped right back up like nothing had happened.${prompt}
  9773: Rightaru as rain!${prompt}
  9774: |-
    Oh, Amchuchu...
    I couldn't be...more happy...${prompt}
  9775: Then what happened to Tiana wasn't a dream. Oh, this is so wonderful!${prompt}
  9776: Well...I apologize for getting caughtaru in the moment. I let my mouth run a little too wild. It's one of my character flaws.${prompt}
  9777: A flaw? Like the way you sit there making excuses?${prompt}
  9778: I know just the place to send you for rehabilitation-wation--deeeeeep within the snowy paradise of Kamihr Drifts.${prompt}
  9779: Amchuchu, quitaru butting into other people's business! Can't you see I'm trying to make a heartfelt apology!?${prompt}
  9780: It doesn't sound like an apology so much as smarmily weaseling your way out of responsibility-wility.${prompt}
  9781: For someone so calculating-walculating you're not terribly good at putting two and two together.${prompt}
  9782: Urf...${prompt}
  9783: I'm sorry.${prompt}
  9784: Arciela. ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9785: I'm not clear on some of the details, but we've all heard the gist of what happened.${prompt}
  9786: You gave us the opportunity to come together as one again.${prompt}
  9787: The opportunity?${prompt}
  9788: G-g-good day, Arciela.${prompt}
  9789: Hmph.${prompt}
  9790: Vortimere...and Ingrid.${prompt}
  9791: And yet another.${prompt}
  9792: Heya, Princess.${prompt}
  9793: Morimar!?${prompt}
  9794: I had a little run-in with this lady friend of yers.${prompt}
  9795: After we parted she stumbled upon me and dragged me back here. Not quite kicking and screaming, mind you, but...${prompt}
  9796: At least, not then. So she drags me here and lays into me before fixing me up right in front of your higher-ups!${prompt}
  9797: Who goes around doing that!?${prompt}
  9798: You insufferable fools and that squalid lump of metal you call a weapon might have defeated Hades.${prompt}
  9799: But whining about the twelve orders' problems with spit drooling down your collective chins makes my stomach churn!${prompt}
  9800: Is hacking and cleaving the remnants of a two-bit has-been all you know how to do? Did you deign to spare even a thought for what happened next?${prompt}
  9801: No. So the Merciless One had to swoop in and prevent this oldster from bleeding out on the carpets.${prompt}
  9802: Show some gratitude for once!${prompt}
  9803: I c-c-convinced Hildebert and the other orders of what occurred that terrible day.${prompt}
  9804: Yet your a-a-absolution is not something I seek.${prompt}
  9805: I have wronged you more than the others. Later, I w-w-withdrew to look at the city with fresh eyes. And I realized...${prompt}
  9806: '...How terrible the m-m-mistake I made was.${prompt}'
  9807: What has been done cannot be undone...but I am ready to face any p-p-punishment you deem applicable under Adoulinian law, despite my status as a man of the cloth.${prompt}
  9808: Yes...I must answer to laws of both the church and the state.${prompt}
  9809: You have a grand b-b-benevolence to forgive Ingrid her wrongdoing...but the entire affair was my idea.${prompt}
  9810: I am ready.${prompt}
  9811: The intent behind our actions was immaterial, for the ends would never have justified the means.${prompt}
  9812: Everyone here understands that and deeply regrets their consent, whether tacit or explicit. That's one of the reasons we're here.${prompt}
  9813: Arciela, we are terribly sorry. And to you as well, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9814: The other eleven orders have all signed a pact. No longerrr will we engage in faction warfare.${prompt}
  9815: Well, it'll take a while for that to purrrcolate to the lower ranks, but we'll work at it.${prompt}
  9816: It's a task for all of us to face.${prompt}
  9817: Technically I was a proponent of colonization, but you know what? It doesn't matter much to me either way. As long as we all agree on something!${prompt}
  9818: Look at you, Flaviria! Your flair for diplomacy-womacy makes me a bit ill on the inside.${prompt}
  9819: Ahaha! How lovely it is to be getting along at last.${prompt}
  9820: “At last”? How would you know? You never contributed to these meetings-weetings anyway.${prompt}
  9821: Don't think for a second-wecond we'll let you off so easy from now on!${prompt}
  9822: Y-yes ma'am!${prompt}
  9823: Arciela, we are all prepared to accept the Order of Adoulin's leadership...your leadership.${prompt}
  9824: United under your banner, under the watch of Ortharsyne...as it was back in the time of the founder king.${prompt}
  9825: Please, Arciela. Lead us to prosperity.${prompt}
  9826: '...I understand. Forgiveness takes time.${prompt}'
  9827: No, Hildebert. It's not a question of forgiveness.${prompt}
  9828: I, too, am filled with regret and shame over the things I've done. To hear you say something like this...${prompt}
  9829: It comes as a total shock.${prompt}
  9830: Truth be told, the reason I came here today was to apologize to all of you.${prompt}
  9831: No apologies are necessary.${prompt}
  9832: We are the ones who did not stand strong beside you in your time of need.${prompt}
  9833: No, I can't...can't...${prompt}
  9834: Hearing you all say this has moved me beyond words.${prompt}
  9835: Thank you for being here.${prompt}
  9836: And I'm sorry for having been so brash and rude.${prompt}
  9837: Arciela...${prompt}
  9838: Your petition has hit the soft spot of my heart.${prompt}
  9839: Then the matter is--${prompt}
  9840: But I cannot accept. The Order of Adoulin has Ygnas...my brother. So it is not my place to lead.${prompt}
  9841: Forgive me.${prompt}
  9842: Then perhaps I should abdicate in your favor.${prompt}
  9843: Huh...?${prompt}
  9844: How long has it been since you've seen me like this, Arciela?${prompt}
  9845: Ygnas?${prompt}
  9846: Everything you've done for this nation, I've watched from afar.${prompt}
  9847: You isolated yourself from the squabbling of the others and continued down the path you felt was right. A noble path, one worthy of a queen.${prompt}
  9848: Of that, there can be no debate.${prompt}
  9849: Ortharsyne is proof of the founder king's will. I shunned it, electing for the path of colonization instead.${prompt}
  9850: Were it not for you taking it up, it would have sat gathering dust in a never-opened treasury safe.${prompt}
  9851: Looking upon it now, I believe that the future had been decided at that moment.${prompt}
  9852: No, Ygnas, you're taking that a bit too far...${prompt}
  9853: Let's set that aside and return to the request Hildebert made of you.${prompt}
  9854: I'm the one who pushed him into that decision.${prompt}
  9855: You?${prompt}
  9856: No one has thought of the country's greater welfare more than you, not just in words, but in actions.${prompt}
  9857: No matter how simply you explained your experiences and the world you've seen, none of us here could begin to comprehend your wisdom.${prompt}
  9858: A new future awaits our city, and you're the only one who can lead us there.${prompt}
  9859: Should you not listen to Hildebert, then at least listen to me.${prompt}
  9860: Show us what a bright future looks like.${prompt}
  9861: Please.${prompt}
  9862: '...I shall.${prompt}'
  9863: There's much I've left to learn, and I will need help along my way.${prompt}
  9864: But I know I'm not alone.${prompt}
  9865: All of you are here, too.${prompt}
  9866: Adoulin's path is for us to decide!${prompt}
  9867: I feel this decision deserves a speech with the proper gravitas.${prompt}
  9868: A speech! Me!?${prompt}
  9869: This is all so sudden! I need some time to--${prompt}
  9870: Arciela, everyone wants to hear something that comes right from your heart.${prompt}
  9871: No one expects something stuffy and formal.${prompt}
  9872: Tell us your thoughts about where Adoulin's future lies.${prompt}
  9873: Understood.${prompt}
  9874: I first set foot in the forest out of a sense of curiosity, and learned much with every step I took.${prompt}
  9875: But I would have met with nothing but dead ends were it not for the support and cooperation of many.${prompt}
  9876: We have been driven apart into houses supporting and opposing colonization.${prompt}
  9877: And civil debate often gave way to flaring tempers.${prompt}
  9878: But none of that matters now.${prompt}
  9879: What Adoulin needs more than ever are strong ties between the twelve orders.${prompt}
  9880: I can't deny that the jungle has suffered more than any.${prompt}
  9881: My aim is to respect the cyclical nature of the land, live in harmony with the powers guiding it, and lead the forest to the same prosperity we desire to achieve.${prompt}
  9882: Just as we have our own hopes and fears, so too does the forest--a living, breathing thing as much as any of us. We must respect and revere each other.${prompt}
  9883: That's how we achieve true progress.${prompt}
  9884: Please, everyone, hear my plea. I can't do it alone.${prompt}
  9885: Under the light of this blade and the banner of the founder king...${prompt}
  9886: I vow that our union will never again be broken.${prompt}
  9887: I, Arciela V. Adoulin, swear to you all...
  9888: That the dawn of a new Adoulin is at hand!${prompt}
  9889: (Heh, who'd've imagined things'd fall inta place so quickly?)${prompt}
  9890: (That princess sure grew up fast.)${prompt}
  9891: (With this, Adoulin'll know peace at last.)${prompt}

  9897: Well, I'll be! Look who's come to visit the castle!${prompt}
  9898: Who're you again?${prompt}
  9899: Sweet mercy, that vile clown erased so much of my memory when he plowed his way into my skull!${prompt}
  9900: All my embarrassing failures, times of doubt, and everything else that would hamper my self-image...poof!${prompt}
  9901: So that's why I'm now the perfect model of humility and authority. A figure that all can aspire to be!${prompt}
  9902: So, ${name-player}, hopefully one day you can be just as spectacular as I am!${prompt}
  9903: |-
    ...Oops.

  9904: Ahaha! You're so fun to joke around with. How could I ever forget the face of the one who rescued me from certain death?${prompt}
  9905: I've been doing a little pushing and prodding behind the scenes to procure a little something as a token of my gratitude.${prompt}
  9906: I asked the twelve orders to come up with something, and what do you know--they pulled through!${prompt}
  9907: Of course, far be it from me to know what would suit you best, so you can pick your favorite!${prompt}

    The ${item-singular: 11[2]}.${prompt}
  9909: Of course it'd take your pretty head some time to decide. Why, I'd be fretting for half an hour if you asked me to choose between three delectable cakes, and here I provide you with a stunning array of not three, not six, but twelve choices!${prompt}
  9910: Goodness! If this were a market, all those succulent sweets would be tearing a hole in my bag! But if I could only pick one...well, I'd want to take time to ponder it, too.${prompt}
  9911: But if you change your mind and decide you want a different one later, I'm sure I could arrange for that to happen...for the small price of 300,000 bayld.${prompt}
  9912: Hey, I didn't make up the rules!${prompt}
  9913: The lovely Fremilla is anything but greedy.${prompt}
  9914: If I were making the decision, you could have all twelve! Alas, I am but a humble servant. Who is not out for personal gain.${prompt}
  9915: But enough talk about my total political impotence.${prompt}
  9916: I'll be totally upfront. That bayld I'll charge you? It'd go to repairing that terrible destruction that happened down in Rala Waterways. Surely you remember.${prompt}
  9917: Of course, it'd be an anonymous donation. None of that “Fremilla the Magnanimous” or anything. How does “The Erratic Maidservant” sound?${prompt}
  9918: Hiya, ${name-player}! Have you made your decision yet?${prompt}
  9919: Are you sure that's the one you want?${prompt}
  9920: You certainly do have a flair for the beautiful!${prompt}
  9921: Of course, Chez Fremilla has a return policy. If you decide a different trinket would better suit you, I'll exchange it for your current one and a fee of 300,000 bayld.${prompt}
  9922: Let me throw in a little something extra as thanks for all the good you've done for the Sacred City of Adoulin!${prompt}

    Well met, ${name-player}.
    Forrrgive me if I'm butting in, but did you happen to lose ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}?${prompt}
  9926: A particularly vigilant citizen returrrned it to the castle, where I decided to hold it for safekeeping. Anything emblazoned with the Order of Adoulin's seal is too important to let out of my sight.${prompt}
  9927: Please ensurrre that you do not lose it again. I would hate to picture the look on the princess's face were you to do so.${prompt}
  9928: A particularly vigilant citizen returrrned it to the castle, where I decided to hold it for safekeeping.${prompt}

  9931: It appears you have procured the requisite amount of bayld. Please select the item you desire.${prompt}

  9953: There's no way we'll get any further without more data. If only we could find someone willing to...${prompt}
  9954: You there! Are you familiar with the leafkin?${prompt}
  9955: They're creatures about as big as coconuts, and they wrap themselves in leaves for clothing. They're so adorable that I just want to give them a big hug!${prompt}
  9956: They may not be a part of mankind, but I wouldn't go so far as to call them “monsters.” They aren't aggressive, and they have many fans throughout Adoulin.${prompt}
  9957: The Scouts' Coalition wants to learn more about their behavioral patterns and life cycles, but we lack any credible information.${prompt}
  9958: That being the case, we're looking for people willing to assist in our surveys.${prompt}
  9959: Please, think of the leafkin.${prompt}

    How about it?

    Sure.
    Let's “leaf” this alone.${prompt}
  9961: |-
    Dang it!
    Well, you know where to find me if you change your mind.${prompt}
  9962: |-
    Let's get right down to business, then.
    Step one is to gather information in town.${prompt}
  9963: I've received reports of leafkin sightings from the Couriers', Pioneers', and Peacekeepers' Coalitions.${prompt}
  9964: However, we have to verify the authenticity of any information we receive if we don't want to go on a wild-goose chase.${prompt}
  9965: Should you come across any promising leads, follow up on them by going to the source, and report back to me with your findings.${prompt}
  9966: I suggest you get started by visiting the other coalitions I've mentioned--Couriers', Pioneers', and Peacekeepers'.${prompt}
  9967: |-
    Can I help you?
    ...I see. Information on the leafkin-weafkin, is it?${prompt}
  9968: You know, I saw something resembling a leafkin when I stopped at a frontier station in the Morimar Basaltaru Fields.${prompt}
  9969: |-
    Let me take out my mappy-wap. See if that jogs my memory...
    ...There we go. Right here, around K-10.${prompt}
  9970: '''Course, it was nightaru out, so I can''t be sure...but I''d lay money that it was one of them creatures you''re looking for.${prompt}'
  9971: Forgotaru already? That's OK. I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, either. I saw a leafkin-like creature in the Morimar Basalt Fields, somewhere in the K-10 vicinity.${prompt}
  9972: It was a moonless night, so my eyes could have been playing tricky-wicks on me. Best go see for yourself.${prompt}
  9973: All you adventarus from the Middle Lands are keeping the coalition busy. I'm earning my paycheck, I tell you.${prompt}
  9974: We'd better beef up our patrols if we hope to keep everyone safe from the trouble you lotaru are stirring up.${prompt}
  9975: You're the ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who's been assisting us with the leafkin investigation? Any news?${prompt}
  9976: Hmm? A rusty pioneer's pickaxe...?${prompt}
  9977: You caught it while fishing in the Zoldeff River?${prompt}
  9978: Now that you mention it, the Pioneers' Coalition has reported large quantities of equipment vanishing.${prompt}
  9979: The leafkin are behind it, aren't they? What are they playing at, hampering the progress of our efforts?${prompt}
  9980: I'll inform the Pioneers' Coalition of the situation.${prompt}
  9981: The leafkin are planting seedlings? Hmm...${prompt}
  9982: Well, they DO use leaves and fruit as garb. Trying to replenish the forest to fashion more garb, no doubt.${prompt}
  9983: That would explain why they feel threatened by our activities in Ulbuka.${prompt}
  9984: You saw a leafkin...take an umbril head-on!? I didn't think they had such gumption in their buds!${prompt}
  9985: Umbrils are ancient, mysterious creatures that have nested in Ulbuka since time immemorial.${prompt}
  9986: We know as little about them as we do the leafkin. Perhaps the two are natural enemies?${prompt}
  9987: This is really something to ponder. We'll make sure to analyze the leafkin in light of what we've learned about the umbrils.${prompt}
  9988: We might be able to use this as a foothold for further knowledge.${prompt}
  9989: You've delivered us some valuable information. The coalition cannot offer much in terms of payment, but it is the thought that counts--not the size of the reward.${prompt}
  9990: Come back if you learn anything more.${prompt}
  9991: You've come up with far more than we could have expected. This will help our research proceed much more smoothly.${prompt}
  9992: The more we learn, the more we realize we don't know. Unique creatures, indeed, these leafkin.${prompt}
  9993: They must have some purpose in life that we cannot yet comprehend...${prompt}
  9994: '...Pay no attention to my ramblings. A member of the Scouts'' Coalition should not speak authoritatively without sufficient proof.${prompt}'
  9995: One day, we'll figure out what makes them tick. I'm sure you'll be interested in our findings as well.${prompt}
  9996: The leafkin surely are mystifying creatures. I hope you're looking forward to what we find out about them as much as we are.${prompt}
  9997: The door is firmly shut.${prompt}
  9998: Hey there, Erisa. Look at the massive haul I brought in today.${prompt}
  9999: That's so many! You burned down the forest, didn't you?${prompt}
  10000: Why do you have to put it like that? You know I respect the sanctity of nature.${prompt}
  10001: Don't be so flippant. You know what will happen if we anger the forest...${prompt}
  10002: Yeah, yeah, I've heard it all before.${prompt}
  10003: Until next time!
  10004: <Sigh> Always running off when he hears something he doesn't like.${prompt}
  10005: Good day. Say, you wouldn't happen to be a pioneer, would you?${prompt}
  10006: It's quite uncommon for one of your ilk to come this way, seeing as the Order of Renaye is opposed to your work.${prompt}
  10007: Excepting, of course, that man who was just here.${prompt}
  10008: I, too, am opposed to all this nonsense, but the seeds he brings back are invaluable for my research into Eastern Ulbuka.${prompt}
  10009: Thanks to his efforts, I have been able to discover new species of plants that we never before knew existed.${prompt}
  10010: Some of these have begun to bear fruit, and the Order has high expectations for the bounty they may provide.${prompt}
  10011: 'There''s just one problem. Just as the fruit begins to sprout, the plants stop growing. Even the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} created by the Inventors'' Coalition is of no help.${prompt}'
  10012: Just the thought of them withering on the vine terrifies me, but there is so little I can do!${prompt}
  10013: 'Of course, if I had ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, I might be able to do something about it.${prompt}'
  10014: 'Kyff once brought me a seed that had ${item-plural: 0[2]} mixed in with it.${prompt}'
  10015: 'My previous findings indicate that ${item-plural: 0[2]} contain nutrients that accelerate the growth of plants.${prompt}'
  10016: If I can create special fertilizer using them, then I can bring the dying plants back to life in no time at all.${prompt}
  10017: 'I realize that it isn''t my place to ask, but if you could bring me back ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, I would be eternally grateful.${prompt}'
  10018: Kyff mentioned that he first found them on black mandragoras roaming the Yahse Hunting Grounds.${prompt}
  10019: I understand if you don't want to help a complete stranger, but those root creatures are probably your best bet if you do.${prompt}
  10020: Of course...it only makes sense that this special fertilizer helps these new plants to bear fruit.${prompt}
  10021: 'The black mandragoras located in the Yahse Hunting Grounds can provide the ${item-singular: 0[2]} I need for my fertilizer. At least, that''s what Erisa said.${prompt}'
  10022: I can't stress enough how much it would mean to us if you were able to obtain some.${prompt}
  10023: 'Oh ho, so you got yourself ahold of ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  10024: Erisa mentioned something about creating fertilizer from this stuff.${prompt}
  10025: Where can I find Erisa?${prompt}
  10026: Kyff? Who's that man with you?${prompt}
  10027: Well, you see--${prompt}
  10028: Enough with the formalities. Those plants you've been growing? I need 'em.${prompt}
  10029: But...why?${prompt}
  10030: Erisa, please. You have to trust me.${prompt}
  10031: These plants are dangerous, so Ikhi Askamot has permitted us to take them.${prompt}
  10032: But...my entire research revolves around studying dangerous plants. Why would these be any different?${prompt}
  10033: What you really mean is that you aren't satisfied laying waste to the forest. You want to rob the precious life it has given us!${prompt}
  10034: I have no time for this. Just hand over the plants.${prompt}
  10035: They're in the back, right?${prompt}
  10036: 'Yvermain, hand me the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10037: Huh? Oh, right.${prompt}
  10038: Graaah, where in the hell could she have put them!? The plants aren't here at all!${prompt}
  10039: Where'd she take 'em? Out with it, or it'll be your hide on the line!${prompt}
  10040: Sh-she said she'd take them somewhere more appropriate for fertilizing...${prompt}
  10041: Where!? Tell me, now!${prompt}
  10042: Th-the Civic Arboretum in the Rala Waterways...${prompt}
  10043: You! Don't just stand there! If you're a pioneer like us, then it's your moral duty to help us get those plants back!${prompt}
  10044: Those cursed things grow from seeds dropped by rafflesia.${prompt}
  10045: As soon as they start bearing fruit, everyone around the plant will be in danger!${prompt}
  10046: Listen to me very carefully. The plants you're looking for have bulky leaves with fruit covered in a hard shell. Pluck off those harvest-wrecking monstrosities.${prompt}
  10047: The two of us'll head to the Peacekeepers' Coalition right away. We've got to warn them before it's too late!${prompt}
  10048: We'll go to the Civic Arboretum as soon as they're ready. Now hurry!${prompt}
  10049: Erisa must have gone to the Civic Arboretum to fertilize the plants.${prompt}
  10050: What did that guy say? Something about bulky leaves and hard shells?${prompt}
  10051: I've got to stay here and keep an eye on things. Make sure Erisa comes back in one piece!${prompt}
  10052: Erisa, don't be so down. There's no way you could've known that would happen.${prompt}
  10053: If only I had done what they'd asked...things would have turned out differently.${prompt}
  10054: I kept telling myself that I was doing it for scientific purposes, when I was really just being selfish.${prompt}
  10055: It's only natural to feel attached to something you've worked so hard for.${prompt}
  10056: You're the person who came to the Waterways earlier, aren't you?${prompt}
  10057: Kyff said...to give this to me?${prompt}
  10058: This...this is the first thing I ever grew...${prompt}
  10059: I remember...back then, even if it was just some common houseplant, I was so happy to see my charge blossom.${prompt}
  10060: I see. He doesn't want me to give up on my horticulturist pursuits so easily.${prompt}
  10061: I suppose he's right. If I acquiesce now, everything I have done will be for naught.${prompt}
  10062: Still, everything I have done has besmirched the name of the Order of Renaye. I should have been more careful.${prompt}
  10063: But Kyff gave me a new lease on life.${prompt}
  10064: I've got to keep on going--starting with these seeds right here.${prompt}
  10065: But he's not the only one I have to thank. You have done me a great service as well.${prompt}
  10066: This is long overdue, and I apologize for my tardiness.${prompt}
  10067: I only hope that you will find it an appropriate reward.${prompt}
  10068: I swear, my eyes are starting to fail me after reading so many reports of pioneers falling victim to...rather unconventional traps set throughout the wilderness.${prompt}
  10069: By Altana's good graces, I know that nefarious Blackthorn Coven is behind it all, but what could they possibly hope to gain by doing this...?${prompt}
  10070: |-
    Break the silence?
    ${selection-lines}
    What's the “Blackthorn Coven”?
    No, it's not my place.${prompt}
  10071: The Blackthorn Coven is a band of three of the cruelest enchantresses to ever assail Vana'diel.${prompt}
  10072: They nest deep within the woods, performing strange rituals and subjecting all who dare enter their domain to unspeakable horrors--and such incidents have been on the rise of late.${prompt}
  10073: We have a pontification of our finest exorcists scouring the land for them, but I would still exercise caution should your travels take you wealdward.${prompt}
  10074: Excuse me, ${choice-player-gender}[good sir/fair lady]!${prompt}
  10075: I'm terribly sorry to bother you out of the blue like this, but my name is Nashu. I'm also an exorcist...or at least one in training.${prompt}
  10076: I couldn't help but overhear your conversation regarding the Blackthorn Coven.${prompt}
  10077: To tell the truth, many veteran exorcists with a storied history of service to Altana think it would be best to leave the Coven to their own devices for the time being.${prompt}
  10078: The Order of Weatherspoon is staunchly opposed to the colonization of Ulbuka, so they advocate maintaining this coincidental alliance.${prompt}
  10079: I, however, cannot abide the suffering of my fellow man!${prompt}
  10080: As an exorcist, it is my duty to bring the heavy hammer of justice down upon these mavens of madness, these harlots of heresy!${prompt}
  10081: It certainly won't be an easy task. Ensnaring even one adept practitioner of the dark arts would fell a man, but three... To be honest, I don't think I'm skilled enough to capture them myself.${prompt}
  10082: |-
    Therefore, would...
    Would you be so kind as to lend me a hand in this endeavor?${prompt}
  10083: |-
    Lend a hand?
    ${selection-lines}
    With pleasure.
    To this twerp? Never.${prompt}
  10084: |-
    I...I know... I shouldn't have even asked.
    Sorry for so blatantly overstepping my bounds.${prompt}
  10085: Make sure not to be caught unawares should you venture into the weald. There is no way to tell whether we will have captured the Blackthorn Coven by the time you enter.${prompt}
  10086: |-
    Y-you're that adventurer from before!
    Over here, over here!${prompt}
  10087: You wouldn't happen to have changed your mind about....you know...the thing, would you?${prompt}
  10088: |-
    I give you my undying gratitude!
    Before I get too excited, though, I should probably ask your name.${prompt}
  10089: |-
    ${name-player}, is it?
    Well, ${name-player}, I'm utterly overjoyed to have made your acquaintance!${prompt}
  10090: |-
    Getting down to business...
    The last confirmed sighting of the Blackthorn Coven I've heard about was in ${unknown: 0x01053782878280}, around what corresponds to grid J-6 on your map. That seems like as good a place as any to start looking.${prompt}
  10091: Might you be ${name-player}?${prompt}
  10092: |-
    Nashu asked me to relay this message to you.
    It simply states, “Meet me at J-6 in ${unknown: 0x01053782878280}.”
    Whatever could be going through that boy's head?${prompt}
  10093: |-
    He knows full well the Blackthorn Coven has been spotted there numerous times.
    Should you choose to search him out, may Altana's guiding light envelop you in its protective glow.${prompt}
  10094: Good tidings to you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10095: Nashu told me all about your little adventure and how it ended in failure. I cannot say that I am surprised--the Blackthorn Coven wouldn't be the wickedest witches in the west if any wide-eyed novice could capture them.${prompt}
  10096: I must say, though, the number of pioneers falling victim to traps throughout the jungle has absolutely plummeted.${prompt}
  10097: |-
    Don't get any ideas.
    Getting involved with those harpies will only result in him--or you--getting hurt.${prompt}
  10098: ${name-player}! ${name-player}! ${name-player}!${prompt}
  10099: How serendipitous of me to bump into you.${prompt}
  10100: I just became privy to some most scandalous gossip. Will you please lend an ear?${prompt}
  10101: Apparently those mothers of malevolence have entered into negotiations with the only clan more bloodthirsty than they...the Velkk!${prompt}
  10102: 'These reptilian degenerates are known to waddle around the crevasses of ${unknown: 0x010537828A8280}, indiscriminately attacking on sight all who infringe upon their territory.${prompt}'
  10103: They relentlessly tear their prey apart with their powerful jaws for the sheer joy of killing, and then leave the remaining shards of bone and strips of flesh to rot upon the ground. Normally, no one would ever encroach upon their settlement.${prompt}
  10104: What would keep a ruthless band of murderers like the Velkk from trying to slaughter these witches--who are still technically people--with no questions asked?${prompt}
  10105: 'Perhaps our failed attempt to capture the sorcerous trio in Yorcia Weald has come back to haunt us. Now that I mull this over, we never did hear what they wanted with ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}...${prompt}'
  10106: |-
    Oh, my...
    Could we have inadvertently aided in the coven's nefarious deeds? If so, we have to find them and stop them before I suffer a theological crisis!${prompt}
  10107: |-
    Help find the coven?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course, for Altana's sake!
    Um, Zaffeld told me to stay away.
    No, go have your theological crisis.${prompt}
  10108: <Sigh> Of course. It is all my fault. When will I learn to leave the more incriminating details out of my reports?${prompt}
  10109: Still, I firmly believe that my keen sense of justice will triumph over my bureaucratic shortcomings! In the name of all that is holy, ${name-player}, I beseech your aid!${prompt}
  10110: |-
    I...I see...
    My apologies for burdening you with such a request.${prompt}
  10111: Getting involved with those harpies will only result in him--or you--getting hurt.${prompt}
  10112: Have you decided to help me dig up what the Blackthorn Coven is planning? I am always in need of someone who has the Goddess's blessing, you know.${prompt}
  10113: Thank you immensely!${prompt}
  10114: 'The triad of terror rendezvoused with the Velkk in quadrant E-7 of ${unknown: 0x010537828E8280}, if recent scouting reports are to be believed.${prompt}'
  10115: Maybe those lazy lizards are still basking in the glow of their successful negotiation. If you could head down there and put your ears to the ground, as it were, hopefully we can learn something of value.${prompt}
  10116: Just make sure you don't end up six fulms under!${prompt}
  10117: 'Nashu asked me to remind you to “muster at E-7 of ${unknown: 0x010537828E8280}” before he darted off.${prompt}'
  10118: I tried to warn him about the foolishness of his acts, but he simply muttered something about divine retribution. Listen to me--that boy's unstable, and you'll get into nothing but trouble if you keep chasing the Blackthorn Coven.${prompt}
  10119: What can the coalition do for you today, good ${choice-player-gender}[sir/lady]?${prompt}
  10120: You say that Alianne from the Order of Janniston would like our maester to investigate something for her?${prompt}
  10121: Is this some kind of joke? If Margret were to take on the work of every last citizen who wanted her aid, why...${prompt}
  10122: People thirst for knowledge, Wegellion, and as the Scouts' Coalition maester, I feel a responsibility to aid our citizenry whenever I am able.${prompt}
  10123: But you would have me shut the doors to one in search of answers. What say you about this particular case?${prompt}
  10124: Esteemed Maester, I only mean to say that we must carefully select our battles.${prompt}
  10125: Your approach is correct, indeed--but it is not your place to make decisions for me.${prompt}
  10126: O-of course not, Maester.${prompt}
  10127: Pray tell, what would you ask of me?${prompt}
  10128: |-
    It's about that young man, then? I suppose I should not be surprised.
    Truth be told, I have been continuing to investigate his case.${prompt}
  10129: I do not mind taking on something else related to this incident, but I have one condition.${prompt}
  10130: I chanced upon a volume of great interest during my research.${prompt}
  10131: It was old and worn, and the grease of a thousand fingers had smudged some parts so that it was nigh indecipherable.${prompt}
  10132: 'However, I have an idea how to restore the work to legibility. All I would need is for you to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  10133: With the time which I would have devoted to procuring those items, I can focus on finding some clue which might lead you to a cure.${prompt}
  10134: But, a word of warning, if you will.${prompt}
  10135: Some things...are better left unknown.${prompt}
  10136: Maester Margret has pledged her support to your cause.${prompt}
  10137: 'Bring us ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} that she might continue her pursuits.${prompt}'
  10138: I see you've fulfilled our maester's request.${prompt}
  10139: She has found a person of interest in the case we were discussing earlier.${prompt}
  10140: I see you've returned.${prompt}
  10141: This Taru friend of ours is Ari-Barali. He is prone to put on airs and deliver flowers to my dear friend Svenja, and hence has some information that may be of use.${prompt}
  10142: Would you mind sharing what you have learned with my acquaintance?${prompt}
  10143: O-of course...${prompt}
  10144: 'You see, every day I deliver ${item-plural: 0[2]} to Mistress Svenja...and try to suppress my accentaru so that she looks kindly on me.${prompt}'
  10145: |-
    O-oh! I let it slip out!
    Alianne is the one who always greets me, but one time, she was not there.${prompt}
  10146: And so, I...well...I know I shouldn't have done this, but...${prompt}
  10147: I went around back and peeked into Svenja's room.${prompt}
  10148: Mistress Svenja, you cannot possibly mean to administer this medicine!?${prompt}
  10149: 'It was derived from the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, which the pioneer brought back from Ulbuka!${prompt}'
  10150: Do you know what this means? If the medicine works, it will provide more fodder for those pro-colonization cronies!${prompt}
  10151: We have opposed colonization from the very outset, knowing that the best way to protect our fair nation is to remain within these walls.${prompt}
  10152: And this young man--was he not a pioneer? Was this disease not brought upon him by his own foolhardiness?${prompt}
  10153: I, too, fear that he fell ill due to something he found in the wilds.${prompt}
  10154: And worse, forging further ahead might very well lead to other, more vile sicknesses.${prompt}
  10155: If that is so, Mistress, you of all people must certainly understand what we must do.${prompt}
  10156: I suppose there is no helping it. Let us refrain from administering the medicine a little while and see how this plays out.${prompt}
  10157: At first, I wasn't sure what they meant.${prompt}
  10158: But then I realized that they were choosing not to help save a young man even though the means were right in front of them.${prompt}
  10159: That one so lovely could say something so malicious...it shook me to my very core.${prompt}
  10160: It took great courage for you to speak out like this.${prompt}
  10161: Well, my dear pioneer, you now have something to go on.${prompt}
  10162: Whether you choose to tell Alianne or not is for you alone to determine.${prompt}
  10163: It is my job to provide the information, not decide what to do with it.${prompt}
  10164: 'But remember this: a story is like a gold coin--there are always two sides.${prompt}'
  10165: Difficult though it is to forget Ari-Barali's sordid tale, I'll make sure word of it never leaves my lips.${prompt}
  10166: My, my, my. Whatever shall I do with you, ${name-player}? I hear you've been out trying to save the world from the Blackthorn Coven with Nashu again.${prompt}
  10167: I swear my jaw will have to fall from its hinges before you listen to me about staying away from those vexing viragoes.${prompt}
  10168: However, that's all water under Big Bridge now, for any chance you had to go plunging headfirst into thorny thickets will soon be over.${prompt}
  10169: Since we've ascertained their involvement with the Velkk, Lord Vortimere has ordered some...adept landscapers to do a bit of pruning.${prompt}
  10170: As I do not believe your pioneer's badge certifies you as a groundskeeper, I suggest you stick to colonization and leave the dirty work to us.${prompt}
  10171: |-
    There you are, oh friend of friends!
    I was just about to go off and parlay with those enchantresses and thought you might want to come along.${prompt}
  10172: To be honest, I still cannot fathom why anyone would ever be willing to conspire with heathens as blasphemous as the Velkk. My face turns flush with anger at the mere thought of such an atrocity.${prompt}
  10173: However, the fact remains that they saved me from certain doom at Dho Gates.${prompt}
  10174: Could it not be possible that their spinous exteriors are only a facade covering their silky soft hearts? Perhaps all we need to fertilize a congenial relationship with our sylvan sorceresses is to talk with them.${prompt}
  10175: What do you say, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  10176: |-
    What do you say?
    ${selection-lines}
    How perspicacious of you.
    Has your brain turned to mulch!?${prompt}
  10177: Whew, you cannot imagine how comforting it is to hear that someone of your prowess holds the same sentiments. My confidence has shot through the roof!${prompt}
  10178: No wonder my superiors have me swabbing chamber pots instead of helping exorcise evil spirits...${prompt}
  10179: Yet even a tenderfoot like me has something to offer this cloister! One could even say that I, specifically because of my inexperience, bring new blood to the family!${prompt}
  10180: Therefore, I was thinking of returning to the Blackthorn Coven what they gave us in our prior adventures.${prompt}
  10181: Of course, as a member loyal to the Order of Weatherspoon, my first thought was to hand it over to my superiors...but such would amount to betrayal of the people who rescued me.${prompt}
  10182: Instead, I have decided to use this opportunity to meet and show them of the error of their ways. My silver tongue will convince them to consort with the Velkk no more!${prompt}
  10183: Surely you will join me in my pursuit of justice, ${name-player}, will you not?${prompt}
  10184: |-
    Will you help?
    ${selection-lines}
    Fine, I'll go.
    Count me out, scout.${prompt}
  10185: |-
    Oh... I see...
    Maybe I should stop relying on you so much. I will never learn to stand on my own two feet by constantly grasping at your coattails.${prompt}
  10186: Now that we've ascertained the Blackthorn Coven's involvement with the Velkk, Lord Vortimere has ordered some...adept landscapers to do a bit of pruning.${prompt}
  10187: Have you decided to help me meet our arch-nemeses?${prompt}
  10188: If their past behavior is anything to go by, they will surely be skulking about Yorcia Weald! Let us rendezvous within its thickets at what corresponds to J-6 on your map.${prompt}
  10189: I could barely make out what Nashu said as he rushed past like a man on a mission, but I did hear something about going to J-6 in Yorcia Weald.${prompt}
  10190: |-
    How many times do I have to tell you that--
    ...You know what? If you haven't learned by now, I'm not going to say anything.${prompt}
  10191: It seems rrridiculous that Robertioux, of all people, could do away with an undead like that.${prompt}
  10192: Yes, I could hardly believe my ears when I first heard the news. To think it was one of those ancient dullahans decked out in plate armor, too.${prompt}
  10193: Even mentioning the name of those headless relics makes me think of my history lessons about the Great Expedition. If they have truly reappeared en masse, then who other than us can Adoulin call upon to save it?${prompt}
  10194: Our days of sitting idly by watching pioneers pilfer all the prrrestige will finally be over.${prompt}
  10195: Hopefully the age of exorcists has come at last, and hats off to Robertioux if it is so.${prompt}
  10196: |-
    ...<Sigh>
    Altana damn that stupid Elvaan.${prompt}
  10197: Jeepers creepers, I didn't know a pioneer was watching me!${prompt}
  10198: Sorry, I shouldn't be speaking ill of my cohorts while others are within earshot.${prompt}
  10199: Yes, I work alongside the overnight sensation that is Robertioux.${prompt}
  10200: His fifteen minutes of fame have to be up soon, though. I mean, how could someone as bumbling and bland as he possibly survive the scrutiny of the public eye?${prompt}
  10201: And yet, there he is, placed on a pedestal higher than the heavens. I'm envious of his situation, to say the least.${prompt}
  10202: I know it's the socially acceptable thing to be proud of your colleague's accomplishments, but...but...it's Robertioux.${prompt}
  10203: If he gets to be called a genius, then I deserve to be called the oracle of the Adoulin islands! Robertioux's neither the hero Adoulin wants, nor the one it needs.${prompt}
  10204: Come to think of it, for a wimpy birdbrain like him to get any kind of praise, he must've been secretly training from sunset to sunrise.${prompt}
  10205: If only I could find out what sort of regimen he used, then maybe my day would come as well...${prompt}
  10206: |-
    ...Aha, perfect!
    I believe the Scouts' Coalition is going to write an article about his exploits.${prompt}
  10207: Would you mind asking someone there what they were able to dig up on him?${prompt}
  10208: |-
    Mind asking?
    ${selection-lines}
    Not a bit.
    You're a big girl; do it yourself.${prompt}
  10209: But if I ask, they'll think me a copycat! I can't have that!${prompt}
  10210: Pleeease? When have I ever asked you for a favor?${prompt}
  10211: |-
    Thanks so much!
    By the way, my name's Erfimia. Pleased to make your acquaintance.${prompt}
  10212: I didn't ask for your name, but if you really want me to know it...thanks again, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10213: Alright, I'll see you when you're done doing my bidding. I've got to start preparing for how to receive all the accolades I'll get after learning Robertioux's secret.${prompt}
  10214: I heard the Scouts' Coalition is wrrriting a piece on Robertioux.${prompt}
  10215: |-
    That is simply wonderful!
    I cannot recall the last time that one of us Weatherspoon members was featured in any publication.${prompt}
  10216: |-
    Hmmm?
    An article on an Elvaan named Robertioux?${prompt}
  10217: |-
    ...Oh yes, that flavor of the month who seems to be on the tip of everyone's tongue recently.
    Reepi-Molpi, you've a visitor!${prompt}
  10218: A visitaru? Tell 'em to scram-wam.${prompt}
  10219: This upstanding ${choice-player-gender}[gentleman/gentlewoman] is quite determined to ask you a few things about Robertioux.${prompt}
  10220: Pffft, I'm the one who'd like to ask-wask a few things.${prompt}
  10221: That bastid won't give me a second of his time despite the fact that even the Ordah of Weathahspoon--the most uptightaru group of fogies you've evah seen--gave their permission!${prompt}
  10222: 'He''s got some twisted sense of modesty. Ev''ry time I ask fah a word or two, he always gives the same-wame reply: “I am hardly a worthy subject for your prose.”${prompt}'
  10223: You'd think he'd know bettah. If he'd just oblige me, I could cast his ordah in a much prettiah lightaru than it is now.${prompt}
  10224: Eithah way, I've got bupkis-wupkis on him.${prompt}
  10225: '...Except fah the factaru that he was spotted explorin'' Yorcia Weald befoah givin'' that undead the ol'' one-two.${prompt}'
  10226: Maybe someone somewheahs in the vicinity-winity of Yorcia Weald's frontieah station would know somethin'.${prompt}
  10227: |-
    Gettin' to the weald ain't gonna be a picnic in the pahk, though.
    Ugh, even the Blackthohn Coven would be easiah to intaruview than Robertioux.${prompt}
  10228: |-
    Stop the press-wesses!
    What if you went with me? Nary a Naakual could stand in our way.${prompt}
  10229: '''Sco, ''sco, ''sco!${prompt}'
  10230: Reepi-Molpi? He ventured off towards Yorcia Weald.${prompt}
  10231: As grizzled an outdoorsman as he sounds, I fear for his safety. Would you mind checking up on him?${prompt}
  10232: “Hear ye, fiends from dimensions unknown! With my arrival, the clouds shall part and Altana's holy light shall bathe thee in Her purifying radiance.”${prompt}
  10233: “Returnest from whence thou came, vile demons!”${prompt}
  10234: |-
    ...Oh, ${name-player}!
    What do you think of my performance?${prompt}
  10235: |-
    What do you think?
    ${selection-lines}
    I was completely captivated!
    It's a total yawn.${prompt}
  10236: 'And who wouldn''t be? I pulled that line right from one of the most hallowed novels on exorcism ever to be penned: “Ergo Expulsion.”${prompt}'
  10237: 'You have terrible taste, ${name-player}. How could you yawn at one of the most famous lines in one of the most famous novels on exorcism: “Ergo Expulsion”?${prompt}'
  10238: I guess you're what Lord Vortimere terms a “philistine.”${prompt}
  10239: Back to business, though. What did you learn about Robertioux?${prompt}
  10240: 'Does he swallow ten ${item-plural: 0[2]} whole before running a hundred laps upon the surface of Fontis Xanira?${prompt}'
  10241: |-
    He...exorcised an Ahriman? In Yorcia Weald?
    That's rather...ordinary.${prompt}
  10242: |-
    ...Huh.
    Could it be that perhaps “slow and steady wins the race,” and solid fundamentals are more helpful than feats of perceived divinity?${prompt}
  10243: |-
    This has given me much to ponder.
    Thanks for opening my eyes to this perspective, ${name-player}. In return, you can have this.${prompt}
  10244: To think I'd been looking at this issue wrong the whole time.${prompt}
  10245: One doesn't simply improve without grasping the basics. And how could I ever hope to usurp Robertioux's fame if I only copy him!?${prompt}
  10246: I've gotta do things my own way, at my own pace, and conquer my own inadequacies! In fact, why don't I get started on my own personal training regime right now?${prompt}
  10247: “Returnest from whence thou came, vile demons!”${prompt}
  10248: The streets are abuzz with Robertioux's latest exploits. First an exorcism, then an undead vanquishing...the man's out prrrotecting our fair city while the Pioneers' Coalition lackeys flip through raunchy periodicals on the chamber pot.${prompt}
  10249: I would dare say that he aims to become a high exorcist himself. Oh, to see the look on Ingrid's face when...${prompt}
  10250: Oh, ${name-player}! How long has it been?${prompt}
  10251: Have you seen the article the Scouts' Coalition penned on Robertioux?${prompt}
  10252: “A glimpse into the work of the famed Robertioux, mere moments before banishing a vile skeleton from the land!${prompt}
  10253: “Even Ingrid herself blushes before his divine prowess!”${prompt}
  10254: To think--me, following in the footsteps of one so grand!${prompt}
  10255: I vow that one day those reporters will be doodling the name “Erfimia” in their notebooks.${prompt}
  10256: What better first step than to venture to the site of his latest banishing? And who better to accompany me than you, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  10257: |-
    Will you assist Erfimia?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    Why me?${prompt}
  10258: This'll be a day to remember!${prompt}
  10259: Laymen often throw the word “undead” around without fully understanding it. The term encompasses the unliving as a whole, but there are many different types. Some are demons, others unholy spirits...yet there are also those who remain tethered to this world owing to some unfulfilled promise or deep-seated regret.${prompt}
  10260: And if something manifested itself there once, it's highly likely it'll do so again!${prompt}
  10261: Why, what if the banished fiend were to make a reappearance? Surely you don't expect an inexperienced one such as myself to hold my own!${prompt}
  10262: And if something manifested itself there once, it's highly likely it'll do so again!${prompt}
  10263: This article says that Robertioux quelled the abomination in Yorcia Weald, somewhere around J-8.${prompt}
  10264: Even though Rrrobertioux vanquished the immediate threat, Yorcia Weald is no place to let your guard down. Stay safe.${prompt}
  10265: Araustoix has assembled a twenty-strong force of exorcists to banish the Blackthorn Coven once and for all. Good riddance, I say.${prompt}
  10266: Our brothers and sisters advance on the Velkk stronghold even as we speak. Hurry to Marjami Ravine, ${name-player}, and join the call to arms!${prompt}
  10267: Your aid would be invaluable in stopping their further incursion against us. We're counting on you!${prompt}
  10268: Well met, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  10269: I must extend my thanks for your valiant service to our order--no, to all of Adoulin.${prompt}
  10270: I was hoping you would stop by the priory.${prompt}
  10271: Nashu has been looking for you as well. To tell you the truth, I didn't think that he had it in him.${prompt}
  10272: There's no denying it--with these events he's grown into a full-fledged exorcist of the Order of Weatherspoon.${prompt}
  10273: Hah, and look who walks in--${prompt}
  10274: |-
    ${name-player}!
    Have you seen Soraa and the others?${prompt}
  10275: They've disappeared from the hospital without a trace.${prompt}
  10276: |-
    I see...
    Then I guess I was too late.${prompt}
  10277: I did find two of these on the desk in their room. Maybe...maybe this was their way of saying goodbye.${prompt}
  10278: It's a shame. Just when it seemed we could be...friends.${prompt}
  10279: I think one of these was meant for you. Here.${prompt}
  10280: From now on, chances are you won't be seeing much of me, either.${prompt}
  10281: As a proper exorcist, my first year will be spent on pilgrimage across the archipelago's sacred sites, while getting the laws and edicts hammered into my head.${prompt}
  10282: They say the first year is the hardest. It's a road all exorcists must travel, but I'm still more than a little nervous.${prompt}
  10283: I owe you one, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10284: You're the only reason I could become a proper exorcist in the first place.${prompt}
  10285: If it weren't for you, I'd still be on kitchen duty or scrubbing the dormitory floors.${prompt}
  10286: I figure the only way I can thank you properly is to work my rear off until I can be self-reliant.${prompt}
  10287: |-
    Thanks, ${name-player}. You've really saved my life, in more ways than one.
    Until we meet again!${prompt}
  10288: I remember my first year as an exorcist. Those were dark days... Ugh, no more remembering.${prompt}
  10289: Hail, ${name-player}! You've come at just the right time.${prompt}
  10290: 'Nashu said that if I ever saw you, I should give you this ${item-singular: 0[2]}. He said he found it somewhere.${prompt}'
  10291: That guy... He snuck out to bring it here right in the middle of his meditation retreat. Breaking retreat is a zero-tolerance offense here at the priory. He's now confined to his quarters for who knows how long.${prompt}
  10292: I guess he hasn't changed that much after all. Still, I can't help but feel a little sorry for him.${prompt}
  10293: What? You want to get him out of confinement?${prompt}
  10294: Well...I don't think it'd be impossible with the right...incentive.${prompt}
  10295: |-
    What do you say? (current bayld: ${number: 1})
    ${selection-lines}
    How does 10,000 bayld sound?
    That's too bad.${prompt}
  10296: Whoa, there! This certainly changes things. With such a generous contribution, I'm sure Nashu will be back in retreat in no time.${prompt}
  10297: 'Ah! I almost forgot, here''s that ${item-singular: 0[2]} I kept for you. Hang on to it.${prompt}'
  10298: Whoa! With this sum I'm sure...wait, this isn't 10,000. Hah! You almost had me there, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  10299: It is indeed. Don't get me wrong though, I'd like to help him out if I could. It's just that these sorts of negotiations can be...expensive, you know.${prompt}
  10300: 'Nashu is confined to quarters for sneaking out during meditation with the ${item-singular: 0[2]} he found.${prompt}'
  10301: With a little...incentive, I might be able to get him out of there.${prompt}
  10302: Did you hear? To think--after all his endless days toiling, Robertioux is finally to be made high exorcist!${prompt}
  10303: It was only a matter of time with that one. How many years has it been since the last conferment ceremony?${prompt}
  10304: I only wish my rank afforded me the honor of witnessing it myself.${prompt}
  10305: Rrrats! Why is it that only the high exorcists are allowed to attend?${prompt}
  10306: Oh! Are you looking for Erfimia?${prompt}
  10307: Hehe, it's my job to be currrious. Besides, you're always talking to her out here.${prompt}
  10308: Lately she's been locking herself up in Celennia Memorial Library. Her nose has always been burrried in some book or other, but lately she's been taking out so many books that the staff has issued a formal complaint!${prompt}
  10309: I'm a little worrried, actually. If you're headed back down there, would you mind checking in on her?${prompt}
  10310: Erfimia's been cooped up in Celennia Memorial Library for days. I hope she's still eating.${prompt}
  10311: A shame to hear that Robertioux turrrned down the title of high exorcist.${prompt}
  10312: What a waste. I would have accepted in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  10313: Have you seen Robertioux, lately?${prompt}
  10314: Hardly. He seems to have all but disappeared from the public eye. I wonder what could have brought about such a sudden change in demeanor.${prompt}
  10315: Oh? And who might you be looking forrr?${prompt}
  10316: 'Aha... I see now. So you lost the ${item-singular: 0[2]} that Erfimia gave you?${prompt}'
  10317: So that explains why she applied for a new one not long ago.${prompt}
  10318: 'You know, outsider, ${item-plural: 0[2]} are given to full exorcists as part of their confirmation. They aren''t some common arrrticle you can find anywhere.${prompt}'
  10319: I thought it was strrrange that a girl as diligent as Erfimia would ever lose such a precious item.${prompt}
  10320: And yet...here you've gone ahead and lost it forrr her, it would seem.${prompt}
  10321: 'But...you''re in luck! You see, a ${item-singular: 0[2]} just so happens to have turned up in our lost articles office. I told you, I know everrrything!${prompt}'
  10322: 'Not many exorcists worth their salt would ever lose theirs, so I''d wager that ${item-singular: 0[2]} is yourrrs.${prompt}'
  10323: Normally we would never hand the priory's property off to an outsider, so I reckon Erfimia must have had a verrry good reason in your case.${prompt}
  10324: I'll tell you what, in exchange for a generrrous donation to the priory, I'll let you keep it.${prompt}
  10325: Fantastic! Your donation will help us a grrreat deal, I'm sure!${prompt}
  10326: That would be fantastic! Huh? Uh...you seem to be a little shorrrt on bayld, but...thanks for the thought.${prompt}
  10327: 'Really? I''m sure Erfimia would be heartbroken if she ever found out you lost her prrrecious ${item-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt}'
  10328: 'With the rrright donation I''ll make sure that she never finds out...and you get your ${item-singular: 0[2]} back!${prompt}'
  10329: Whew, my mouth's so dry it's turning to sand...${prompt}
  10330: 'You know what would really whet the old appetite on a scorcher like this? ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  10331: 'From my experience, ${item-plural: 0[2]} taste even better when kindly purchased by a selfless adventurer from the Middle Lands. Yup, compassion is truly the most effective flavoring around.${prompt}'
  10332: Wow, all this talk has made me even thirstier. It's like my whole body's withering from drought.${prompt}
  10333: 'There''s no way I can discuss all that clandestine information only privileged people get to hear with my throat this dry. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the café, however, might make me loosen my lips.${prompt}'
  10334: |-
    What? For me?
    I'm so sorry! I feel like I've coerced you into buying this for me. “Feel” being the operative word here.${prompt}
  10335: |-
    Alright, you're definitely the ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] I've been searching for!
    See, I'm a journalist working over in Western Adoulin.${prompt}
  10336: I'm busy getting the latest scoops from around the city even as we speak.${prompt}
  10337: Eastern Adoulin's the best place for that, too, since there are so many opulent and influential personages around. All I have to do is lend them an ear and I get all I need to know.${prompt}
  10338: Although, not being as...financially stable as my interviewees, I'm forced to act like some ne'er-do-well and participate from the fringe. “Act” being the operative word here.${prompt}
  10339: Luckily, my constant efforts have been handsomely rewarded with the juiciest tidbit I've plucked in a while.${prompt}
  10340: |-
    It went a little something like this:
    “We want you to collect intelligence pertaining to the formation of contemporary Adoulin. Now, this is a highly classified mission, so we can't have people eavesd--”${prompt}
  10341: |-
    <Ahem> You get the idea.
    Anyway, the reward's an astounding ${number: 0} bayld! This might be the first scoop I've uncovered without having to embellish anything! I'd look like a shame to the profession if I passed on this job. “Look like” being the operative phrase here.${prompt}
  10342: |-
    Then, at this most important of times, you emerge from the mists of anonymity and appear before me.
    Is this serendipity? Fate?
    Nay...${prompt}
  10343: Necessity!${prompt}
  10344: 'The Goddess smiled upon me and sent this ${item-singular: 0[2]} to bear witness to the history we''d forge together!${prompt}'
  10345: To summarize the who, what, where, when, why, and how of it all...${prompt}

  10347: '...I said that you get to carry out this mission!${prompt}'
  10348: How's that sound? Like the story of a lifetime?${prompt}
  10349: |-
    Well, does it?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course!
    Of course not!
    I dunno... Could you repeat that?${prompt}
  10350: My journalist's instincts told me this wouldn't go as planned. “As planned” being the operative phrase here.${prompt}
  10351: Have you realized the scale of this assignment yet? Have I finally awakened your journalist's instincts?${prompt}
  10352: Ugh, I knew this wouldn't go as...wait, you'll do it!?
  10353: |-
    Okay, then. Time to delegate duties.
    You'll gather the necessary details and I'll write the story. It'll be a three-legged race to the finish line!${prompt}
  10354: To review, I need stuff pertaining to the formation of Adoulin as the Sacred City, so...there should be some facts lying in wait around Adoulin.${prompt}
  10355: |-
    Maybe the Yahse Hunting Grounds and Ceizak Battlegrounds hide some important clues, too...?
    I don't know, I'm just grasping at chocobo feathers here.${prompt}
  10356: I'll take whatever you find and craft from it the most eye-catching piece this continent has ever read! “Eye-catching” being the operative word here.${prompt}
  10357: Now, get cracking! This information isn't going to dig itself up.${prompt}
  10358: So, what marvels have you brought me?${prompt}
  10359: Hmmm...
  10360: This might make for a mildly entertaining read, but nothing eye-catching. I'll need some more information.
  10361: With my authorial prowess, we just might be able to make something of these. Let's get started!
  10362: 'First, what about this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}? It looks important, doesn''t it?${prompt}'
  10363: |-
    Does it look important?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oh, it does.
    Not particularly.${prompt}
  10364: Alright then, next up is...${prompt}
  10365: |-
    This thing!
    I guess it's ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}. This looks important, too, right?${prompt}
  10366: |-
    Phew, I'm glad that's finished.
    Now be prepared to have your mind melt in amazement of my summarization skills!${prompt}
  10367: |-
    What a discovery!
    We've determined that nothing important ever happened in the history of Ulbuka. Case closed.${prompt}
  10368: |-
    What're you thinking!?
    If that's all we have to report, our client's going to annihilate us in a fit of rage! “Annihilate” being the operative word here!
    Let me read through these anyway and you try to pick out what sounds important.${prompt}
  10369: Two hundred years ago, all activity related to the colonization of the continent was suspended indefinitely. The populace retreated behind Jorius Yett and the city shifted its economic focus to mercantilism.${prompt}
  10370: Adoulin's glory had completely vanished one hundred years after the suspension of pioneer activity. Coffers now depleted from the continued support of a system that was eventually banned, the city's military might was insufficient to assert influence over even the tiniest of nations.${prompt}
  10371: Taking these issues to heart, a majority of the Twelve Orders came forth and proposed the abolition of imperial rule. The royal family capitulated to their request and abdicated in favor of a council composed of leaders from the orders.${prompt}
  10372: It supposedly took much longer than expected to establish safe and reliable trade routes due to the intensity of the currents in Ulbuka's surrounding seas. The owner of this chart was also apparently bound for the Tavnazian Marquisate.${prompt}
  10373: |-
    “The mother of Adoulin, Maester Svenja's countenance is without imperfection.
    Her kind gaze emanates warmth and light that embraces all in loving affection.”${prompt}
  10374: Following the king's abdication, a body politic formed from leaders of the Twelve Orders was established and the Sacred City of Adoulin was born.${prompt}
  10375: |-
    That should do it, I think.
    How about you? There anything that'll nab us heretofore unfathomable riches? “Heretofore unfathomable” being the operative phrase here.${prompt}
  10376: |-
    Anything of value?
    ${selection-lines}
    I think so.
    Not at all.${prompt}
  10377: |-
    Alright, then let me send this off via the Couriers' Coalition.
    Now all we have to do is find out the identity of our client...${prompt}
  10378: But who cares who he is, as long as we get paid!${prompt}
  10379: As for your share of the bayld...take this for now. The rest should come in a day or so.${prompt}
  10380: Never once in all my years did I bother to investigate the history behind this continent, but it turns out there are actually some events that pique my interest. “Some” being the operative word here.${prompt}
  10381: |-
    But my pockets are overflowing with bayld!
    Some seems to fall out with each step I take. This is definitely a problem I could get used to.${prompt}
  10382: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know you like to think you contributed to the report as well. About that...${prompt}
  10383: After paying off all the debts I owed around town, I only have so much left. This is all that's physically possible for me to part with. “Physically possible” being the operative phrase here.${prompt}
  10384: I'll get you the rest eventually, I swear! You know I'm good for it.${prompt}
  10385: But my emotions have dried up even faster. I've not a drop of sympathy left to spare for people who don't go by the name “Roskin.”${prompt}
  10386: |-
    Ack!
    Um, about your portion of the reward...I kind of lost it in one of the games held by the Mummers' Coalition.${prompt}
  10387: The reward also turned out to be much smaller than we expected, so...that's how the trail cookie crumbles.${prompt}
  10388: |-
    ...Okay, okay, okay!
    Why don't I draw on my infinite stores of largesse and give you half the bayld I have on hand out of the kindness of my heart? “Largesse” being the operative word here.${prompt}
  10389: My grandfather's grandfather had a pioneering spirit at least the match of any of the pioneering heroes of old. His career, however, was ill-fated...${prompt}
  10390: You see, all activities related to colonization were banned at the time. His devotion knew no bounds, though, so he went into the jungle all by himself despite his family's pleas to put down the pickaxe.${prompt}
  10391: If memory serves me, he headed for...the Ceizak Battlegrounds. Sadly, no one ever heard from him again after he left.${prompt}
  10392: Our family has been opposed to colonization ever since. For me, I just don't want anyone to experience the terrible pain my ancestors did.${prompt}
  10393: |-
    All the young'uns these days are wetting themselves at the mere mention of pioneering...
    <Sigh> I really must be getting too old.${prompt}
  10394: |-
    You want to know about the formation of Adoulin?
    Ummm...sorry, but I don't really know anything about it. I bet the Scouts' Coalition would, though.${prompt}
  10395: Whoa, that's some ancient stuff you're trying to dredge up, there. The various coalitions around here would be much more knowledgeable about that kind of stuff than me.${prompt}
  10396: If you're looking for information about the old pioneering days, that guy recruiting for the Pioneers' Coalition probably knows a lot more than me...${prompt}
  10397: The seas have been quite rough as of late. I cannot imagine anyone making their way to the Yahse Hunting Grounds via ship without the help of a map to delineate the currents.${prompt}
  10398: Of course, our white cap-hardened captain is more knowledgeable about these waters than everyone on the continent. Do not forget to thank him for his lifesaving expertise should you seek passage on his vessel.${prompt}
  10399: Oh, Maester Svenja, how I yearn to be swept up in your toned-yet-lithe arms and lose myself in your deep, calming gaze...${prompt}
  10400: |-
    Oh, th-the Scouts' Coalition...?
    S-since we're experts at stealth, we can do wh-whatever we want wh-wherever we want! In dark alleys, in other p-people's homes...bweheheh!${prompt}
  10401: |-
    Oh, pardon me.
    You're searching for records on Adoulin's founding?${prompt}
  10402: I believe your best bet would be to flip through some of our historical primers.${prompt}
  10403: They're all on that shelf over there. You can have one, but we kindly ask you to refrain from taking any more with you.${prompt}
  10404: All the documents we've compiled in the coalition are for public use. Search 'til your fingers are covered in paper cuts if you want.${prompt}
  10405: Compendiums relating to Adoulin's myriad historical events line the shelf.${prompt}
  10406: Daily reports from coalition members are scattered carelessly about, yet are written in a surprisingly refined hand.${prompt}
  10407: ＜この後、ボタン待ちなしでショップメニューが開く予定です＞${prompt}

    And so have you.♪
    Let's not leave Big Bridge behind.♪

  10410: I've heard all about the gossip. People are saying the curse of the founder king is true and that the colonization effort is doomed!${prompt}
  10411: Even Ygnas S. Adoulin has disappeared from sight, and he's the one who advocated pioneering in the first place! This does not bode well...${prompt}
  10412: |-
    Eastern Adoulin is chockablock full of arrogant nobles and their inflated senses of self-worth.
    Be careful when approaching them, for even the most trivial perceived slight will set them off on a tirade belittling your “woeful lack of civility.”${prompt}
  10413: They're also the reason the Peacekeepers' Coalition was erected here. They act as if pedigree equals privilege and want someone to protect their “historic structures of cultural import” from us “filthy vermin” at all times.${prompt}
  10414: |-
    We, the Peacekeepers' Coalition, are here to serve and protect the citizens of Adoulin!
    Outsiders like you wouldn't know the first thing about how to keep Adoulin safe from...well...the outside!${prompt}
  10415: This fine edifice houses what's known as the Peacekeepers' Coalition. I'll let your imagination run wild trying to figure out what our particular group does.${prompt}
  10416: I know you're from the Middle Lands, but don't go being all buddy-buddy with the Pioneers' Coalition. The tangled webs they weave have ensnared many.${prompt}
  10417: |-
    Welcome to Le Café des Larmes.
    I cannot say that I enjoy gazing upon the vellication of your muscleless physique, but as the heir to this fine establishment, I will not refuse you service.${prompt}
  10418: I cannot say I enjoy the grotesque nature of your deformed countenance, but as the heir to this fine establishment, I will not refuse you service.${prompt}

    Hm? You're an adventurer?
    Then scurry on over to the Pioneers' Coalition before I grab you by the scrrruff and carry you to Western Adoulin myself!${prompt}
  10422: |-
    Oho, a sojourner come to experience the wonders of our fine city, are you?
    Eastern Adoulin surpasses even your wildest expectations for this mysterious continent, does it not?${prompt}
  10423: I can say with certainty that our side of the city is vastly more dignified than the plebian slum... That is where the Pioneers' Coalition resides, however, so you'll have to brave the filth if you wish to register for the colonization effort.${prompt}
  10424: This's Mawgwet's house. She's the maestah of the Scouts' Cowawition.${prompt}
  10425: |-
    It doesn't wook wike she wants you heeah, so go away.
    Only I can be her appwentice!${prompt}
  10426: It takes a certain type of genius to sketch a jungle landscape.${prompt}
  10427: That's why I must focus all my creative energy into a dense ball of concentration. I need my muse to descend from the heavens and set my spirit on fire with a volcanic eruption of inspiration!${prompt}
  10428: How does a tranquil moment spent amidst the soothing chirps of small birds and the rhythmic crash of waves upon the shoreline sound? This café can provide you with all that and more, ${choice-player-gender}[my good sir/my fair lady].${prompt}
  10429: Mainland Adoulin not only has sheer cliffs that rise high above the ocean, but the city itself is nestled quietly behind Jorius Yett--that enormous gate to the west.${prompt}
  10430: This veritable fortress of nature is further protected by Western Adoulin, which--fortunately for us--would take the brunt of any attacks that might actually penetrate the city.${prompt}
  10431: That means many unique buildings from antiquity have survived to this day. Should you have some spare time, I recommend taking a stroll and getting a good look for yourself.${prompt}
  10432: Stroll northwards and you shall meet with a wharf that docks ferries bound for the Yahse Hunting Grounds.${prompt}
  10433: Hahaha, your concern about sea monsters wreaking havoc on Adoulin is certainly a logical one to have. I myself consider the Peacekeepers no more than jesters dressed in steel rather than motley.${prompt}
  10434: Yet, praise be to Altana, such a dreadful event has yet to occur.${prompt}
  10435: |-
    You're on the hunt for a fleshless sort of prrrey? Well, our ears, eyes, and noses are the best in the reconnaissance business!
    That's why we're the Scouts' Coalition.${prompt}
  10436: |-
    Hmmm...
    My sources tell me that the inforrrmation you seek can be obtained at the Pioneers' Coalition in Western Adoulin.${prompt}
  10437: |-
    What's more imporrrtant than gil or bayld? Information!
    Looking for some facts to sink your teeth into or grab your arrrchnemesis by the throat with? Then step inside the Scouts' Coalition!${prompt}
  10438: This abode is where Gratzigg, the Peacekeepers' Coalition maester, sleeps his nights away when he's not slaving over his desk.${prompt}
  10439: Gratzigg thoroughly loathes pioneers with his heart and soul. Rumors have it that he even sprinkles his breakfast with flakes of skin from the remains of pioneers he's cornered in alleyways.${prompt}
  10440: There's a large system of tunnels under this city called the Rala Waterways.${prompt}
  10441: |-
    Almost everyone who's been down there talks about hearing grotesque howls deep within. Some have even seen monsters, they say.
    Maybe they slip through secret holes to get around the magic barrier...I don't know.${prompt}
  10442: I'm Ysadel, a member of the Order of Adoulin. My charge is to provide assistance to pioneers in any way possible.${prompt}
  10443: |-
    My apologies, but I'm afraid I can't help you if you aren't a pioneer.
    It's some council decision, so it all goes over my head.${prompt}
  10444: I can, however, point you in the direction of the Pioneers' Coalition. Just cross Big Bridge into Western Adoulin and you can't miss it. They should be able to provide the preliminary aid you require.${prompt}
  10445: Have you had the chance to venture down into the Rala Waterways?${prompt}
  10446: One of my acquaintances works in the Civic Arboretum there. Should you ever tire of culling the monstrosities that lurk down there, please say hi for me.${prompt}
  10447: |-
    You're about to board a ferry bound for the Yahse Hunting Grounds.
    This ain't some noble's backyard, though. Many a good man has died right off the boat there, so make sure you're prepared before you board.${prompt}
  10448: |-
    Set sail for the Yahse Hunting Grounds?
    ${selection-lines}
    Aye aye, Cap'n!
    Let me test the waters more.${prompt}
  10449: |-
    A wharf be lying beyond here, but the vessel ain't quite ready yet. Amazing what one sea monster can do to a ship that size, I swear.
    It'll probably be fit to sail once you register with the Pioneers' Coalition, though.${prompt}
  10450: Prepare yourself, your family, and even your imaginary companions for life in the jungle with our latest wares!${prompt}
  10451: Get lost, commoner.${prompt}

    Of course, it's my right.
    No, it's not worth my attention.${prompt}

    Indeed I shall.
    I still have business here.${prompt}
  10457: The Celennia Memorial Library contains relics of knowledge from ages past as well as the latest-watest illuminated publications. We can't grantaru access to unproven philistines, however. Sorry.${prompt}

    Nothing.
    Send me to my Mog Garden!

    Rent-a-Rooms.
    Mog Gardens.
    Mog Garden expansion.${prompt}
  10463: I'm sure you can recall the Rent-a-Room you used back in the Middle Lands.${prompt}
  10464: The ones here function in the exact same manner as the ones you've already grown to love as your homes-away-from-home.${prompt}
  10465: In addition to Rent-a-Rooms, we are also working to provide pioneers with “Mog Gardens.”${prompt}
  10466: I hate to burst your proverbial bubble, but we have yet to receive permission from the council to open them to the pioneering public.${prompt}
  10467: Mog Gardens are special areas located on the islands dotting the Adoulin Archipelago which have a variety of facilities suited for all your gathering needs.${prompt}
  10468: Absolutely no fee is required to take advantage of this service.${prompt}
  10469: We hope that you utilize your Mog Garden to the fullest.${prompt}

  10471: |-
    If your garden's services can expand, they can decrease, right?
    Not so! You never have to worry about losing what's already part of your Mog Garden, even if the Pioneers' Coalition should fall on hard times!${prompt}
  10472: You can visit the Mog Gardens of the following party members. Is there anyone's in particular you want to visit?${prompt}

  10477: |-
    Listenlistenlisten!
    I saw a black beastie hopping from roof to roof!${prompt}
  10478: |-
    I wanna catch it and talk to it!
    Do you think monsters can talk? What would they say if they could? Do you think they even like Humes?${prompt}
  10479: You're damn right this estate belongs to an important person! Just look, it's purrrched upon a hill that overlooks Eastern Adoulin!${prompt}
  10480: This grrrand abode is actually the home of Ikhi Askamot, our minister of education. She's famous not only for her political role, but also because many claim she's the rrreincarnation of legendary geomancer Sih Renaye.${prompt}
  10481: Most of Adoulin's well-to-do purchase residences on the top of this hill.${prompt}
  10482: I assume it's so they can actualize the metaphor of “looking down” on the peasantry, but maybe some just do it for the view. There have to be at least a few magnanimous nobles here...right?${prompt}
  10483: I saw someone slinking through the alleyways the other night. I could only describe him as a “shady gent.”${prompt}
  10484: |-
    Odd, I know.
    When I asked my superior about it, he told me people have spotted a guy fitting that description for years!${prompt}
  10485: |-
    I h-h-hope it's not a ghost! I'm d-d-deathly afraid of ghosts!
    I can barely take a step without getting Galkabumps anymore.${prompt}
  10486: This hotel's staff is the absolute paragon of hospitality, I must say. What's more, the architecture and interior design surpass even the most opulent facilities I've previously had the pleasure of visiting.${prompt}
  10487: The only downside to surrounding oneself in such luxury is that it depletes your life savings. With not a gil to my name, I must prowl the streets like a common beggar in search of suitable employment.${prompt}
  10488: I tried getting an interview with the former royal family at Castle Adoulin, but they turned me down at the gates! Don't they understand that inquiring minds are desperate to know more about this historical household!?${prompt}
  10489: |-
    Oh well, at least I've been able to snatch up pieces of gossip around town. Maybe I can use that as a pretense to bag myself a rich broad.
    Heh heh.${prompt}
  10490: |-
    What is it? I haven't the time to dawdle, you know.
    I'm meeting with some affluent merchants very soon.${prompt}
  10491: |-
    We're going to discuss what needs must be met after the colonization effort has had some time to develop. The faster we read trends, the more money we'll make!
    Bwahaha!${prompt}
  10492: All big dreams start as small seeds. Plant some of our seeds and watch your own dreams grow!${prompt}
  10493: Ugh, did you come here for the express purpose of ruining my vacation!?${prompt}
  10494: If I'd have known just how loud you pioneers squawked, I'd be at my other house in the Far East instead!${prompt}
  10495: Welcome to Adoulin, mon ${choice-player-gender}[ami/amie]! Have you some business with moi this day?${prompt}
  10496: I just bumped into this strange fellow a few days ago. He said he came from a place called the Middle Lands.${prompt}
  10497: |-
    Could he possibly be the accomplished technician all the ladies around town are gossiping about?
    I believe they said his name was...Cid? No, that doesn't sound quite right...${prompt}
  10498: I made a fortune here in Ulbuka, so I decided to spend a little extra and dine at this restaurant everyone was praising.${prompt}
  10499: Much to my dismay, the food was atrocious, the atmosphere abysmal, and I could barely understand anything the chef said!${prompt}
  10500: I'll have to get started on my next venture to rid myself of the bad taste that place left in my mouth.${prompt}
  10501: Know you the Silver Knife, ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Madame] Pioneer?${prompt}
  10502: It is a special club which only those born with a silver spoon in their mouths may enter--I don't know why “Knife,” though. Sadly, even as a member of the Elvaan race, I lack the upbringing to gain access to the wonders within its walls.${prompt}
  10503: This impressive estataru belongs to Melvien de Malecroix, the minister of finance.${prompt}
  10504: Despite fierce opposition from many in Adoulin, he convinced the council to move forward with the colonization effort. The only reason-weason you're able to stay here is because of him, so he deserves your utmost respect.${prompt}
  10505: But now...none of us will ever see him again. The horrors-worrors of the jungle know no bounds!${prompt}
  10506: I had always longed to become an exorcist at this priory. Ever since I was but a babe suckling on my mother's teat, I knew that this was my calling.${prompt}
  10507: |-
    And I finally realized that dream recently!
    I have been completely absorbed in my training. No evil spirits will be spraying our citizenry with pea soup, not while I'm around!${prompt}
  10508: You may have already heard this during your travels, but there was an “incident” at the Wake of the Lilies over in the Middle Lands not so long ago.${prompt}
  10509: I can already picture the day evil spirits will descend upon this city en masse and suck the souls from the living, occupying their hollowed bodies and roaming the landscape for fresher flesh! It is for that day and that day alone we train... The power of Altana compels you!${prompt}
  10510: With the advancement of the colonization effort, people have begun reporting sightings of crrryptic fiends darker than the most ominous shadow and often said to be harrrbingers of disaster.${prompt}
  10511: These crrreatures, named umbrils, may just be the entities that the exorcists have been trrraining to combat all these years. At least that's what Vortimere tells us.${prompt}
  10512: This extravagant edifice is one of the many assets held by our current minister of judication, Hildebert. ${prompt}
  10513: However, Hildebert is an assiduous individual whose services are constantly in demand by the general public. As he rarely has the opportunity to return to his abode, he graciously allows Vortimere to occupy it.${prompt}
  10514: Should you ever need the counsel of either of these esteemed statesmen, this would be the place at which to seek it.${prompt}
  10515: |-
    This is the maintenance-waintenance tunnel into the Rala Waterways.
    It's coalition policy not to let people wander down there, but we'll make an exception if you're willing to cooperate with us Peacekeepers.${prompt}

    Descend into the Rala Waterways?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  10517: |-
    What'd you say your name was? ...${name-player}?
    Never heard it before. Prrrobably because it's not worth hearing.
    Can you even name one herrroic feat you've accomplished here?${prompt}
  10518: |-
    Your name's...${name-player}?
    Sounds vaguely familiar, like some nonsense a derrranged beggar would mutter to himself in the alleyways.${prompt}
  10519: |-

  10535: Nhili, ${name-player} is a geomancer, just like me. Please let us see Ikhi Askamot.${prompt}
  10536: Ah, yes, dearrr Sylvie. I'd love to help, but she is quite busy these days...${prompt}
  10537: Please! Please! It's a matter of life or death!${prompt}
  10538: My goodness! Sylvie, daaarling, what are you doing way out here?${prompt}
  10539: Lhaiso!${prompt}
  10540: Are those...tears, my pet? Whatever could be wrong?${prompt}
  10541: Well, this is quite the pickle for you then, no? To think, Hostenn missing, gone without a trace.${prompt}
  10542: A geomancer going missing can only mean one thing--he has incurred the wrath of nature herself. Tragic.${prompt}
  10543: Oh dear, I have perhaps been a bit harsh. I meant no ill will, I assure you.${prompt}
  10544: N-no, it's all right. I'm just pleased that you understand how difficult this is for me.${prompt}
  10545: I'm here to ask for Ikhi's aid--she's the reincarnation of the primal geomancer, Sih Renaye, right?${prompt}
  10546: But it must be fate that brought me to you, great Lhaiso. Finally, something's gone right.${prompt}
  10547: P-please! I want you to help Daddy!${prompt}
  10548: Why, little Sylvie, of course I understand why you would come to me. Your emotions have truly touched me, however...${prompt}
  10549: My best disciple, Ikhi, cannot help you. And of course, that means my aid is absolutely out of the question.${prompt}
  10550: B-but...why?${prompt}
  10551: The legendary Sih Renaye became one with nature, causing rivers to change their course and trees to sprout tall in mere moments.${prompt}
  10552: And then, together with her five disciples, she prevailed over the ferocious Velkk.${prompt}
  10553: Why do you suppose this is? This is simply a personal theory, dear, but I think it is because she was not actually a person.${prompt}
  10554: Great Lhaiso, why do you deign to share your thoughts with these outsiders?${prompt}
  10555: And Sylvie, surely your father's companions are out looking for him.${prompt}
  10556: It's not our place to look for him. He cast his lot with the pioneers, and so it is up to them to find him.${prompt}
  10557: So Sylvie, dearest, surely you can accept our position.${prompt}
  10558: |-
    I-I can't believe...
    This is because I'm of Zacariah's blood, isn't it?
    Fine. I'll go look for him myself!${prompt}
  10559: Oh, the sweet thing has got it backwards. Our desire to help her is without question--we just don't have the ability to do so.${prompt}
  10560: You there--yes, you. I can sense that you have a stronger bond with her than I--go in my stead and help save her father.${prompt}
  10561: Hostenn was last seen in Morimar Basalt Fields, was he not? Then someone at the frontier station there might be able to tell you more.${prompt}
  10562: Sylvie's quite brrrash to head to Morimar Basalt Fields all by her lonesome. It would be terrible if some ill fate were to befall her, too.${prompt}
  10563: Lhaiso has ordered you to go find her fatherrr, Hostenn. Her wishes must be respected.${prompt}
  10564: And if you are a pioneerrr, you must be intimately familiar with the area. The frontier station there can surely update you on the situation.${prompt}
  10565: Other members of the orderrr have told me that even though the great Lhaiso herself went to help Hostenn, he was unable to be saved.${prompt}
  10566: Despite being of the Zacariah lineage, he was a geomancer of the highest caliberrr. He shall be missed.${prompt}
  10567: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}...
    Ikhi Askamot and Lhaiso Neftereh have been waiting for you.${prompt}
  10568: I am afrrraid, however, that Lhaiso has taken ill. Please make your visit brrrief.${prompt}
  10569: Lhaiso, forgive my impudence, but I must be frank.${prompt}
  10570: You may have fallen ill because the higher power is angered at your assistance of the blood of the betrayer.${prompt}
  10571: I disagree. The higher power would not castigate her just because we aided another.${prompt}
  10572: No, what's more likely is that the betrayer's descendant poisoned her.${prompt}
  10573: And Lhaiso, what do you think?${prompt}
  10574: I cannot quite put my finger on it...but it probably has to do with our total inability to stop the colonization of Ulbuka.${prompt}
  10575: Look who it is! One of the pioneers who caused all this trouble to begin with!${prompt}
  10576: This is why I was completely opposed to sharing the powers of the geomancer with one so intent on pillaging and defiling the land.${prompt}
  10577: That's enough out of you all. This ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] is a guest of ourrrs.${prompt}
  10578: Forgive me for not being able to give you a proper greeting, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10579: Lhaiso used the power of the Communion to converse with something greater than us...the higher power...${prompt}
  10580: I suppose I am so tired because the spell took the wind out of my sails.${prompt}
  10581: ${name-player}, I called you to this manse today because I have something to bequeath unto you.${prompt}
  10582: Is it wise to entrust this one with something so precious?${prompt}
  10583: Here...for you.${prompt}
  10584: Many assert that it was a grave mistake for geomancers to have lent their aid to the colonization effort.${prompt}
  10585: But Ikhi and I were both in accord that this issue of opening up the continent is one that should be resolved with the pioneers, not in spite of them.${prompt}
  10586: Nature--the higher power--has strrriven for eons to reconcile the irreconcilable within her loving embrace.${prompt}
  10587: We, too, must follow her example.${prompt}
  10588: As both a pioneer and a geomancer, you stand at the crossroads of two disparate worlds.${prompt}
  10589: I hope, my dear, that you will continue to work with us to find an answer.${prompt}
  10590: The great Lhaiso's condition grows increasingly grrrave by the day. I cannot help but harbor a dark sense of foreboding.${prompt}
  10591: ${name-player}...and Sylvie! You come at the purrrfect time. Lhaiso has been asking for you.${prompt}
  10592: Please, go right in...and when you rrreturn, allow me to inquire as to her physical state.${prompt}
  10593: For you see, she has shut herself in her room and rrrefuses to allow even her most trusted servants entry.${prompt}
  10594: |-

    You in particularrr have piqued her interest. Please, make sure she is well.${prompt}

  10597: There is something...I need to share. And I know that the two of you would understand me more easily than anyone else.${prompt}
  10598: Forgive me for cutting to the quick, but my body is quite frail of late.${prompt}
  10599: Back in the basalt fields...when I used the primal geomancer's bell...${prompt}
  10600: I think that when I called out to nature, I awoke the higher power that had been sleeping within Adoulin for eons.${prompt}
  10601: We have incurred its wrath--by the way we have destroyed nature with every step we make into Ulbuka.${prompt}
  10602: Just the other night, when I began to ring the fabled bell...${prompt}
  10603: <Why dost thou think geomancers are aware of the lifestream and able to manipulate the forces of Indi and Geo?>${prompt}
  10604: <Thou appearest to be of the mind that thy control over the lifestream is due to thy dedication and research.>${prompt}
  10605: <It is contemptible beyond compare that thou hast forgotten why we bequeathed this power to thee.>${prompt}
  10606: <Children of Altana, thou seekest naught but destruction. We have always faced thee with fear and trepidation.>${prompt}
  10607: <Thy kind hath forgotten that thou art but one speck of a greater whole, and thus seek to leave thine indelible mark upon our flesh.>${prompt}
  10608: <Yet Sih was different. Sih believed that humanity's calling was to respect and understand us, and she felt that thy kind could carry out this most noble of goals.>${prompt}
  10609: I know, perhaps more than anyone else, that it was our fault that the pioneering initiative was not stopped.${prompt}
  10610: But please, hear me out--pioneering is a must if Adoulin is to survive!${prompt}
  10611: As the heir to the primal geomancer Sih Renaye's legacy, I have come to this conclusion even in light of the respect and understanding I have for nature!${prompt}
  10612: I know that we must press on...if we are to live to see another century.${prompt}
  10613: |-
    <Thou dost speak like he did...
    Like Zacariah did...
    Then thou art upholding the oath we made him swear in centuries past.
    Prove thy dedication...in the land where he resides.>${prompt}
  10614: That is what the higher power told me...and I am no longer able to ring this most sacred of bells.${prompt}
  10615: N-no...${prompt}
  10616: Yet I am not the only one. Ikhi was unable to call forth its power as well. She has gathered the other geomancers of our order in an attempt to perform the Communion...${prompt}
  10617: But they will surely fail. That is why I called the two of you.${prompt}
  10618: What the higher power taught to Zacariah...it was how to become one with the lifestream, was it not?${prompt}
  10619: Then you, Sylvie...as a direct descendant of Zacariah, you may be able to get the higher power to respond to your call.${prompt}
  10620: And ${name-player}...as one who walks the path of both pioneer and geomancer, your heartfelt feelings will surely call out to it.${prompt}
  10621: It should be...something I do together with the other...geomancers...but...${prompt}
  10622: I just cannot...I am faltering, I...${prompt}
  10623: Please, take the bell and...go with Sylvie to...to where Zacariah sleeps.${prompt}
  10624: Lhaiso!${prompt}
  10625: Lhaiso has fallen into a deep slumberrr. The mages from the Order of Janniston have placed a moratorium on anyone entering or leaving her chamber.${prompt}
  10626: ${name-player}, I think you and I know what we have to do.${prompt}
  10627: It's back to Cirdas Caverns, where Daddy and Zacariah are buried!${prompt}
  10628: The mages from the Order of Janniston have rrrequested that Lhaiso be left to her slumber.${prompt}
  10629: This is the first time in ages that such a trrragedy has befallen us. I hope everything will be all right.${prompt}

    Huh? Where is that thing?
    I know I had it with me a minute ago.${prompt}

    Hmmm...
    I guess if we're not using them anymore, there's no need to keep the process a secret.${prompt}
  11003: The magic happens in Foret de Hennetiel. Certain poisons in the Zoldeff River will react with the ink, causing it to change color. Downright sorcerous, yeah?${prompt}
  11004: I've seen Palomel taking some sheets from the stockroom every now and then, but I can't imagine she actually uses them. I know twitherym that're more skilled with ciphers than she is.${prompt}

  11006: You wouldn't happen to be one of those adventurers from abroad, would you?${prompt}
  11007: You are? Phew, I can't tell you how glad I am to hear that. You see, I've come across a historical heirloom, but I can't hand it over to just anyone.${prompt}
  11008: This painting was drawn roughly four hundred and eighty years ago by the most famous artist of the time. Now you see why I need to sell it to someone as worldly as you, right?${prompt}
  11009: 'While the appraisers estimated its value at over 1,000,000 bayld, I know you''ll give it a good home. That''s why I''ll discount it to a mere ${number: 1} bayld, all for your sake.${prompt}'

  11032: You f-found it lying within the floor of Woh Gates? I find that hard to believe.${prompt}
  11033: Anyway, that d-definitely looks like a sword used in the rebellion around the year 350. Before even the first colonization initiative started in the early 400s, each order made it their top priority to wrest control of the settlement from the others, which obviously led to a v-violent insurgence.${prompt}
  11034: I hate to admit it, but nice job finding an artifact of this much h-historical importance.${prompt}

  11037: This looks to be a record concerning the rash of landshivers that assaulted the continent around three hundred years ago. Interesting... That's the same time that colonization was really starting to gain steam.${prompt}
  11038: You're telling me that a random p-p-peddler claims this to be a four-hundred-eighty-year-old painting? I'm no connoisseur of fine art, but that sounds f-f-fishy to me.${prompt}
  11039: Try showing it to someone at the Renaye residence. They might know b-b-better than me.${prompt}
  11040: So it was just a replica after all.${prompt}
  11041: If that's the case, this fake was probably drawn a year ago to capitalize on the colonization movement. It should only be worth what the materials cost--about 150 bayld.${prompt}
  11042: Everyone in Adoulin seems to be talking about this walking enigma lately. He's always spotted trying his luck at the Mummers' Coalition's amusements, and his outfit's blacker than a funeral procession.${prompt}
  11043: D-d-don't show that to a damn soul, you hear me!?${prompt}
  11044: If you do, I'll cast a pox on you so that your breakfast always tastes like mud. Got it?${prompt}
  11045: This record describes Sverdhried's trip back to Adoulin from a continent innumerable malms away.${prompt}
  11046: If I had to guess, that'd put this document somewhere in the first half of the fifth century--right smack-dab in the middle of an early colonization initiative.${prompt}
  11047: You can have my head on a pike if this isn't from the period when colonization really started to pick up--right before the Great Expedition.${prompt}
  11048: Why am I so confident? Because everyone in the Scouts' Coalition knows this story. It talks about how a whole forest sprung up during the dead of night. Of course we'd be aware of an event of this magnitude.${prompt}
  11049: This is a simple clerical entry from the year 607 detailing the export of giant sheep to the Middle Lands. Adoulin's mercantile pedigree may seem obvious to us now, but it looks like it all started thanks to early colonization efforts.${prompt}
  11050: It's not written here, but apparently descendants of that breed can still be found grazing in the Zulkheim region.${prompt}
  11051: Ugh, this thing's so c-c-crumpled and dirty it's practically illegible.${prompt}
  11052: |-
    Hmmm...
    Considering how archaic the diction is, this couldn't be the same declaration Ygnas made. My guess is that it was issued in the first half of the 400s, during an early era of colonization.${prompt}
  11053: Why, this's information about that underground garden everyone calls the Civic Arboretum. That facility was only erected five years ago, so this doesn't have much to do with the Great Expedition, I'm afraid.${prompt}
  11054: 'The ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} they grow there are pretty d-d-divisive. You either love them or you hate them. I, for one, am part of the latter faction.${prompt}'
  11055: Why're you giving me a dumb old rod?${prompt}
  11056: If you should give this to anyone, it should be the Inventors' Coalition. They're the only ones who'd be able to fix it.${prompt}
  11057: That's a sword foot soldiers wielded during the insurrection that occurred around the year 350.${prompt}
  11058: During the time when colonization was forbidden, each order desperately tried to exert their dominance over the others, resulting in unprecedented bloodshed.${prompt}
  11059: What? You want me to apprrraise a painting? An odd request, for sure, but I think I'm up to it.${prompt}
  11060: '${color-alt: 15}Nhili Uvolep stares at the painting ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} with a discerning eye.'

  11064: Let's get down to business uncovering the impetuses for the Great Expedition, then!${prompt}
  11065: 'First on the docket is this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. The title has enough gravitas in it to crush Sunrise Beacon, so I bet it''s incredibly significant. What do you think?${prompt}'

  11067: '${color-alt: 15}You feel an ethereal grip upon your throat that prevents you from speaking.'
  11068: Sounds like a case of “If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything.” Okay, out it goes. Next!${prompt}
  11069: Someone slow the airship to pessimismville! You're either the most negative person I've met in my life or you're trying to pull my leg. “Trying” being the operative word here.${prompt}
  11070: Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me again and...well, you're not gonna fool me again! Let's start over from the top...and be serious this time!${prompt}
  11071: In the year 350, a deep-seated conflict over political control of the archipelago erupted, embroiling each of the Adoulinian orders.${prompt}
  11072: The founder king's last words to his people began to lose their efficacy circa Crystal Era 400. Though the populace once deathly feared entering the jungle, they then declared that colonization would begin anew.${prompt}
  11073: The year was Crystal Era 405. After the ban on entering the Ulbukan hinterland was lifted, a certain artist gathered his tools of the trade and marched into the heart of the jungle. Once there, he became enamored with the local flora--one gargantuan tree in particular--and thus painted one of the most vivid and influential scenes in the history of the west.${prompt}
  11074: After departing on a long and arduous journey across multiple continents and laying eyes upon myriad wonders, Sverdhried finally managed to make landfall in Adoulin sometime during the first half of the fifth century.${prompt}
  11075: Coinciding with the advancement of the colonization effort and the advent of Crystal Era 550, the earth began to shake mightily at irregular intervals. Fissures gaped wide and whole topographical features were reformed when these manifestations of terric vengeance struck.${prompt}
  11076: In the year 607, domesticated giant sheep were exported to the Middle Lands in hope of both diversifying its breadbasket and enhancing Adoulin's mercantile prowess.${prompt}
  11077: Records exist of a baffling incident where not just one tree, but whole swaths of woodlands matured over the course of a single nightfall in the early part of the seventh century. Certain academics hold that the event described within such documents is specious at best, but their sheer volume leads most to believe their veracity.${prompt}
  11078: 879 is cited as the year in which produce cultivation first began within the Civic Arboretum. Harnessing the power of irrigation, which was made possible thanks to its location in the Rala Waterways, Adoulinian researchers have been able to raise crops that help alleviate the food shortage plaguing this municipality.${prompt}
  11079: Duplicates of a painting considered almost sacrosanct by the art community infiltrated the market starting in 883. While extremely faithful to the original's depiction of a colossal tree guarding the Ulbukan frontier, the condition of the paints used and the type of brush strokes employed make it easy to discern their lack of authenticity.${prompt}
  11080: Multiple people have spotted a cryptic male patronizing the Mummers' Coalition throughout the year 884. Who he is and why he spends so much time at a house of amusement remain a mystery, and perhaps will for eternity.${prompt}
  11081: How's that sound to you?${prompt}
  11082: I'd go so far as to say that it's the pinnacle of relevancy and eon-defining aural ecstasy. “Eon-defining” being the operative word here.${prompt}
  11083: |-
    How's it sound to you?
    ${selection-lines}
    Like a faithful rendition of a sonata.

    R-really!? I truly thought I had something there.
    Well, let's go back to the drawing board in a bit.${prompt}
  11085: I'm glad to hear we're on the same page, hohoho! Let me pass this on to the Couriers' Coalition and we'll be good to go. If only I knew exactly who my employer was, I could send it directly, but...${prompt}
  11086: Who cares about where I get my money from, as long as it's enough to make Yocile swoon for me!${prompt}
  11087: Oops, I almost forgot that you played a minor role in making me into the happiest man in the world. “Minor” being the operative word here. This'll have to suffice for now.${prompt}
  11088: I'll give you the rest of your share when that ludicrously lucrative reward arrives.${prompt}
  11089: |-
    Once I get my hands on it, Yocile's got no choice but to fall in love with me.
    Who's the man? I'm the man!${prompt}
  11090: Oh, fate, thou art a cruel and terrible mistress!${prompt}
  11091: ${name-player}, listen to this! There I was, planning out the route I would take my beloved Yocile on--like any chivalrous gent would...${prompt}

  11096: Hey there, ${name-player}. Boy, are you ever gonna laugh when you hear this.${prompt}
  11097: So, I was minding my own business in the bushes the other day when I <ha ha> saw Yocile taking a stroll with some guy. They were arm-in-arm, mind you!${prompt}
  11098: Of course I couldn't just go up and ask her out in that situation, so get this <ha ha>...I let them pass <ha ha> without saying a word... <Sniffle>${prompt}
  11099: |-
    <Sigh>
    I know you don't care about my plight, so let's talk money.${prompt}
  11100: You might notice there's less than promised. That's because I went on a little spending spree to cheer myself up.${prompt}
  11101: |-
    It did make me feel a little better, though.
    You know what? Material possessions be damned! Take all the bayld I have!${prompt}
  11102: Perhaps it's time I got back on the proverbial chocobo and gave it another go.${prompt}

    If it isn't my favorite pioneer, unsurprisingly come to grace me with ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] presence!
    And since you're here, if I may ask...${prompt}
  11105: You wound me with that dour look! Have you forgotten all we've been through, you and I?${prompt}
  11106: Of course you haven't! Why else would you appear so fortuitously by my side?${prompt}

    How do you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    Aha.
    Huh?
    Still thirsty?
    No clue.${prompt}
  11109: Yes! That's the ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] I've grown to trust!${prompt}
  11110: Why, the same as always, my friend! We must investigate vestiges of the past...together!${prompt}
  11111: Hmph. I was being intentionally vague, so as to let the listener draw ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] own conclusions, thinking ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] would so dutifully accept my request...${prompt}
  11112: H-hey! Get those legs of yours back here! I take it all back--just please, hear me out!${prompt}
  11113: Y-you have already procured...!? Why, I, uh, don't know what to say.${prompt}
  11114: D-don't worry. I promise not to make you cajole Yocile in my stead this time. “This time” being the operative phrase here.${prompt}
  11115: No, I wish you to hear my tale and let the story play out as it will.${prompt}
  11116: C-could it be that my sixth sense has failed me?${prompt}
  11117: The project I'm working on is of much import--it concerns the founder king and his generals.${prompt}
  11118: Think of the ramifications! We could unveil the truth behind Adoulin's most storied myths and legends!${prompt}
  11119: It certainly sounds like a pretty affair, but with every light comes a shadow. You'd sooner stumble upon an even-tempered Velkk than chance upon tales of indisputable veracity.${prompt}
  11120: '...Or so one would think. I, however, happen to have come prepared.${prompt}'
  11121: 'This amazing ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, specially made by the Inventors'' Coalition, has the ability to view snippets of the past.${prompt}'

  11124: |-
    How do you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    Bump? What kind of bump?
    Just get to the point.${prompt}
  11125: This peddler of old curios was raving about the wonders of this odd machine, you see? Who could pass up such a marvel? So I paid the king's ransom he was asking.${prompt}
  11126: It was only later that I realized--the thing didn't come with any sort of manual!${prompt}
  11127: Visions of the past are supposed to come floating to your mind like petals on the wind, but no matter how many times I open and close it or flip it on its side, it remains just what it seems--an old wooden box!${prompt}
  11128: Ugh. Long story short...${prompt}
  11129: I have no idea how to use it!${prompt}
  11130: Since I can't make heads or tails of this stupid contraption, I'll let you borrow it. Mayhap you will have that stroke of luck that has thus far eluded me.${prompt}
  11131: 'Which brings me to a word of advice: remember that daft young girl from before? The one under the Scouts'' Coalition''s employ? Perhaps start with her.${prompt}'

    Well, uh...y-you see...
    I don't think she and I...${prompt}
  11134: Oh, come now! There's no one more suited to the job than you!${prompt}
  11135: After all, we've worked together on multiple occasions. Not even the sky can limit you, my friend!${prompt}
  11136: And look over there--even the Goddess herself is smiling upon you! O, praise be to Altana, may She deliver unto ${name-player} the secrets of this box!${prompt}
  11137: See? Altana and I believe in you. “Altana” being the operative word here.${prompt}
  11138: Now, be off! I shan't keep you from your calling any longer!${prompt}

  11144: |-
    Hmm...
    Most likely ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  11145: Isn't this one of those devices the Inventors' Coalition came up with? The kind that can recall the past?${prompt}
  11146: I'll be blunt. I find it disturbing that out of all the people here in Adoulin, you choose to discuss this with me. What exactly are you looking for?${prompt}
  11147: |-
    What topic are you interested in?

    The life and times of King August.

  11150: Hmm... The life and times of King August...${prompt}
  11151: H-huh!?${prompt}
  11152: K-K-K-K-King August?${prompt}
  11153: Did those Velkk over in Marjami Ravine give you a few too many whacks on the head!? There's “the past” and there's “ancient history,” and I think we both know where that falls on the spectrum!${prompt}
  11154: We're talking centuries here, not decades!${prompt}
  11155: W-wait. I may have remembered something.${prompt}
  11156: I overheard some tosspot talking about peering into the past by projecting her mind into the future; something about refractive energies...${prompt}
  11157: I can't vouch for this queer Mithra's skills, but she claims to see the future. Although, er, it's only thirty seconds or so.${prompt}
  11158: What, you think that sounds crazy? You're trying to see the past using only a wooden box, what else did you expect...?${prompt}

    <Sigh>
    Well, we know a lot about our “great king,” don't we? So I'd say to try looking in...${prompt}

  11167: Why're you still bothering me? Get out there and search!${prompt}

  11170: Hehehehehe.${prompt}
  11171: Ahahahahaha!!!${prompt}
  11172: Excellent!${prompt}
  11173: Well, this certainly beats out my admittedly meager expectations.${prompt}
  11174: Who goes there!?${prompt}
  11175: Twenty-five years old. Single. A quarrel with his father sent him scurrying to the shadows of Western Adoulin, where he makes a pittance as a two-bit private investigator.${prompt}
  11176: Struck out with the ladies seven times, of whom two he actually finagled into first dates. Tends to seek women who...${prompt}
  11177: S-stop your blathering! What do you have against me that you come spouting such filth?${prompt}
  11178: Ah. “Maester” Margret. Have you come to hurl insults at me like some cheap wench throwing a patron out of some seedy tavern?${prompt}
  11179: I'd have expected a more deferential greeting from someone who, I assume, does not wish to become persona non grata at my coalition.${prompt}
  11180: I'm here not to throw barbs. Quite the opposite. Your current research intrigues me, and I would like to inquire about your methods.${prompt}
  11181: What're you playing at!?${prompt}
  11182: You've used this pioneer for your own ends to catch glimpses into the very beginnings of this sacred city.${prompt}
  11183: But something troubles me...${prompt}
  11184: You know as well as the rest of us that the Celennia Memorial Library houses every tome, encyclopedia, and treatise ever written on Adoulinian soil.${prompt}
  11185: A simple kind word to Andreine and you would be swimming in knowledge.${prompt}
  11186: Despite this, you employ a pioneer to hunt and peck through Adoulin and outlying areas for vestiges of the past.${prompt}
  11187: The only logical conclusion is that what you seek is not contained within the library's halls. Hence, you sought the help of one who could move freely about Eastern Ulbuka.${prompt}
  11188: Yet one does not simply stumble upon discoveries concerning events from more than one hundred years prior--especially if such information falls under the purview of the Scouts' Coalition.${prompt}
  11189: And without any solid leads to go on...well, let's just say your pioneer friend would clearly lose interest.${prompt}
  11190: So you came up with a “brilliant” plan.${prompt}
  11191: If you can't find facts, what harm could there be in making some of your own?${prompt}
  11192: What're you implying?${prompt}
  11193: I'll cut to the quick. The seeds of information ${name-player} found--you sowed them yourself.${prompt}
  11194: And when they bloomed, you made sure that ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] was there to reap the harvest.${prompt}
  11195: H-h-he was cheating me the whole time!?${prompt}
  11196: But why go to all the trouble? Because you hoped ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] would find something fresh along the way.${prompt}
  11197: You think yourself clever, don't you?${prompt}
  11198: But I saw right through you, Roskin. So I chose to...inject myself into your affairs.${prompt}
  11199: D-did you tamper...${prompt}
  11200: 'This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} in particular...your craftsmanship was quite impressive. Yet it was also your downfall.${prompt}'
  11201: Anyone could check it out from the library, but you chose to give a fake name when you did so. Did you expect the Scouts' Coalition to be fooled by such blatant fraud?${prompt}
  11202: Which brings me to another point--I was so inspired by your efforts that I inserted a code into your props.${prompt}
  11203: 'Yes, I refer to the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} in ${name-player}''s possession.${prompt}'
  11204: Why don't you try your hand at it?${prompt}
  11205: Mayhap some hints are in order.${prompt}
  11206: 'Organize your findings by year and look for clues: anything which seems out of place.${prompt}'
  11207: After that is done, count the number of people that know the answer, and move each up by one.${prompt}
  11208: Follow these, and the truth will be made manifest.${prompt}
  11209: I believe you are already intimately familiar with the answer...though it has changed from what it once was.${prompt}
  11210: ${name-player}, however, had no trouble deciphering the true meaning.${prompt}
  11211: But I digress.${prompt}
  11212: I deem that the records ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] has collected are of considerable historic interest.${prompt}
  11213: Let me ask--what do you intend to do with this information?${prompt}
  11214: |-
    ...${wait-36: 1}
    Hahaha!${prompt}

    You don't realize, do you, Margret?
    No, it's not that you don't...it's that you can't.${prompt}
  11216: You've completely forgotten that the two of us were once classmates.${prompt}
  11217: |-
    It never mattered how much I worked or how much I struggled.
    You always took top honors.${prompt}
  11218: Do you know what it's like to put forth your mightiest effort and realize that it was all for naught!?${prompt}
  11219: You were always a step ahead, you damn...!${prompt}
  11220: You haven't the slightest inkling of what it feels like to lose!!!${prompt}
  11221: Hmph. And now you want my “valuable information”? I'll bet you do.${prompt}
  11222: The hallowed Scouts' Coalition, renowned as the premier source of information...has failed in its mission to piece together relics of the past.${prompt}
  11223: But not me! I alone have found the truth!${prompt}
  11224: I could ruin your career with but one visit to the Adoulin Examiner.${prompt}
  11225: Picture the headline, in bold font splayed across the front page--“Scouts' Coalition One-Upped by the Intrepid Roskin”!${prompt}
  11226: You'd be the laughingstock of the twelve orders--no, of all Adoulin!${prompt}
  11227: And then, after all these years...${prompt}

    Ha ha ha!
    You're giving me second thoughts...${prompt}
  11237: But be that as it may, your first duty is to recompense ${name-player} for ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] efforts.${prompt}
  11238: My calling as a custodian of history is now a reality--and I owe it all to your superlative actions. “Superlative” being the operative word here.${prompt}
  11239: I thank you from the bottom of my heart.${prompt}
  11240: Good to see you again, ${name-player}! I may be a member of the Scouts' Coalition now, yet I am quite certain I will have need of your talents in the future!${prompt}
  11241: M-Maester Margret....${prompt}

  11243: |-
    It's hard to put into words, but...${wait-36: 1}
    How can you place your faith and trust in that common gutter trash?${prompt}
  11244: |-
    Ha ha ha!
    So that's what's been eating at you?${prompt}
  11245: In the end, what does it matter?${prompt}
  11246: I-I'm afraid I don't...${prompt}
  11247: I had assumed you were referring to the records ${name-player} brought back with ${choice-player-gender}[him/her].${prompt}
  11248: There's more than a passing chance that they aren't facts to be trusted wholesale, but rather extrapolations based on ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] assumptions.${prompt}
  11249: So do I think ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] bore witness to history as it happened? No.${prompt}
  11250: Only one thing should be of interest to us as true purveyors of knowledge.${prompt}
  11251: Physical evidence that leads us to undeniable conclusions.${prompt}
  11252: That information goes beyond stories and old wives' tales, and something about it just feels right.${prompt}
  11253: But even if we wanted to prove or refute it, how could we?${prompt}
  11254: Still, there's a voice inside telling me that it's...${prompt}
  11255: Maester...${prompt}
  11256: Hmph. Listen to me, blabbing on about intuition.${prompt}
  11257: How unbecoming.${prompt}

    Oh, for the love of...
    Let me see if I remember.${prompt}
  11260: |-
    Hmm hmm hmmmmmm...
    If I recall, you had to organize those strange letters in chronological order.${prompt}
  11261: |-
    That would put the order at...
    “Jt AoWv WhAt JvJo Jt.”${wait-36: 1}
    What does that even mean?${prompt}
  11262: And, uh, you have to “count the number of people that know the answer, and move each up by one” once you've solved the first hint.${prompt}
  11263: What're you looking at me like that for!? It's your riddle, you solve it!${prompt}
  11264: This thirst...oh, if only there were someone to release me from this parched prison!${prompt}
  11265: Do my eyes deceive me, or is that ${name-player}? Thank goodness you have seen fit to come to me this fine day, for I have need of a friendly ear.${prompt}
  11266: No, no, it's not about Yocile, but rather the Scouts' Coalition. My first task as an official member is to collate the records you found for me into an informative discourse...an article, if you will.${prompt}
  11267: Maester Margret assured me that my work would be enshrined forever in Celennia Memorial Library.${prompt}
  11268: That means that these very hands will write the history that our children's children will learn! Absolutely wonderful, no?${prompt}
  11269: |-
    How do you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    Wow.
    Yay.
    Nice.${prompt}
  11270: But in order to pen an epic that will be talked about for generations, I need a certain volume of special import. “Import” being the operative word here.${prompt}
  11271: As such, I have a task for you.${prompt}
  11272: Make haste for Celennia Memorial Library and procure “Heroes and Legends of Adoulin” for me.${prompt}
  11273: This should be a piece of proverbial cake compared to the trials I put before you up until now. Just go there and mention that the one and only Roskin sent you.${prompt}
  11274: Enjoy!${prompt}
  11275: This is the specimen I required?${prompt}
  11276: Oho! A transcribed copy? Libraries certainly are filled with marvels, no? Let me take a quick look...${prompt}
  11277: It...really is what I asked for!${prompt}
  11278: I had heard such rumors, of course, but of all the people to get their hands on it! How much bayld did you have to slip Oshasha?${prompt}
  11279: Let me get a quick peek...${prompt}
  11280: |-
    ...
    This volume piques my curiosity nearly as much as the records you brought back!${prompt}
  11281: It will revolutionize the way we view August's initial foray into the hinterlands!${prompt}
  11282: I might have to stop by the coalition and grab a few more vials of ink!${prompt}
  11283: Some may view the fervor I have for my work to be off-putting, but hopefully you view it as one of my more endearing qualities.${prompt}
  11284: Now, to put quill to parchment!${prompt}
  11285: ${name-player}! My latest masterpiece is complete!${prompt}
  11286: I will be scrubbing wax off my desk for days...but that's a small price to pay for academic inspiration.${prompt}
  11287: In fact, your presence brings a smile to my face. As Margret promised, a copy of my work has been delivered to Celennia Memorial Library.${prompt}
  11288: I can hear your heart beating from here! Stop by and bear witness to my genius!${prompt}
  11289: I must admit that I owe you so much. Let me think of a proper way to repay you.${prompt}
  11290: '...Ah! I know just the thing. A transcription of this fascinating volume I chanced upon the other day.${prompt}'
  11291: And please, permit me to give you a little something special, too.${prompt}
  11292: I shall repay my monumental debt over time, so be sure to say hello every so often when your travels bring you nearby.${prompt}

    What is your response?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I am.
    You've got the wrong ${choice-player-gender}[guy/gal].${prompt}
  11297: I see. Never mind.${prompt}
  11298: Here. This is for you.${prompt}
  11299: I know Margret will find the truth.${prompt}
  11300: I've kept you waiting, haven't I?${prompt}
  11301: The whole thing has me in a bit of a tizzy, too. Don't you think it's odd?${prompt}
  11302: Whoops! I've put the cart before the chocobo.${prompt}
  11303: You've removed Adoulin's most immediate threat, but...${prompt}
  11304: When his corpse was hauled back from Kamihr Drifts, I felt there was something...amiss.${prompt}
  11305: Melvien was most certainly dead.${prompt}
  11306: That's something beyond all doubt.${prompt}
  11307: But then he returned.${prompt}
  11308: How can one doubt what they've seen with their own two eyes?${prompt}
  11309: But we've got a pile of dirt to clean up first before we go digging for the root of that mystery.${prompt}
  11310: Something...someone...${prompt}
  11311: '...killed Melvien.${prompt}'
  11312: To hear the other maesters and ministers tell it, he died at the claws of some ferocious beasts, but I know they're mistaken.${prompt}
  11313: While they averted their eyes, I took the opportunity to examine the corpse.${prompt}
  11314: What rended his flesh was no monster. The incisions were too precise for that.${prompt}
  11315: And his body was found hidden away, as if someone didn't want it to be found... No, this was the work of human hands.${prompt}
  11316: But we lack concrete information, so we'll have to thread the needle to prove my hypothesis.${prompt}
  11317: But that hasn't stopped me from making my own inroads.${prompt}
  11318: Persons of interest in this curious affair have clammed up, claiming the incident to have long been settled.${prompt}
  11319: Normally a carrot and stick approach works to loosen up their tongues, but people have grown wary of the Scouts' Coalition of late.${prompt}
  11320: So that's where someone a bit more detached from the situation--a pioneer--comes in.${prompt}
  11321: Yes, ${name-player}, I'm talking about you. Their guard won't be as high if you're the one asking the questions.${prompt}
  11322: It goes without saying that the coalition is beyond willing to recompense you for your efforts.${prompt}
  11323: So, what do you say? Can I enlist your aid?${prompt}
  11324: |-
    Will you assist Margret?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'll do all I can.
    This is none of my concern.${prompt}
  11325: You're not under my authority, so I can't force you.${prompt}
  11326: I'll see what we can turn up in the meantime, but your assistance would be appreciated should you change your mind.${prompt}
  11327: I'd still like your assistance in discovering the truth behind Melvien's death. Can I count on you?${prompt}
  11328: Excellent.${prompt}
  11329: There's one person in particular who's been giving me the runaround.${prompt}
  11330: Estienneux, former aide to Melvien and acting minister of finance. He's a member of the Order of Woltaris and can often be found near their manse near the Coronal Esplanade.${prompt}
  11331: '...Ah, I almost forgot to give you something.${prompt}'
  11332: Here.${prompt}
  11333: It's a portrait of Melvien I drew myself.${prompt}
  11334: I've no idea whether or not it'll be of any use...${prompt}
  11335: But who knows? Everyone knows his name, but not everyone would recognize him on the street. Perhaps it'll help jog their memories.${prompt}
  11336: Next we meet, it'll be on the right side of truth.${prompt}

  11343: Ah, it certainly has been many weeks since we last met. Estienneux, aide to the minister of finance, at your service.${prompt}
  11344: We all have heard how you saved Adoulin from ruin. Though these words doubtless have graced your ears so much they now ring false, thank you.${prompt}
  11345: 'Your assistance in procuring the requisite materials for crafting ${item-plural: 0[2]} was invaluable in helping keep our economy afloat.${prompt}'
  11346: Should there be anything you require, you only need name it.${prompt}
  11347: |-
    What do you ask?
    ${selection-lines}
    You're still an aide?
    Tell me about Melvien when he was alive.
    Show him the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
  11348: Ah, I thought you might inquire about that.${prompt}
  11349: Melvien's most untimely death led to a vacancy in the order, and I have been called upon to act in his stead until such time as a suitable replacement may be found.${prompt}
  11350: But my position is only for external purposes.${prompt}
  11351: The monumental volume of work he was able to handle himself is beyond compare, and his duties are now divided amongst several of us.${prompt}
  11352: I have chosen to retain my old title until such a time that I am able to stand of my own accord.${prompt}
  11353: Interestingly, Melvien always had a penchant for delving into old tomes of various origins.${prompt}
  11354: Naturally, he was quite the patron of Celennia Memorial Library.${prompt}
  11355: I am told it was a fascination for him ever since his childhood, but I never imagined that his thirst for knowledge would...${prompt}
  11356: Ah--please forgive me. You came for facts, not opinions.${prompt}
  11357: O-oh my...${prompt}

    This certainly is a powerful work, but...is that Melvien?${wait-36: 1}
    ...Huh.${prompt}
  11359: Ah, yes, I can recognize from the sharpness of the lines that this was drawn by none other than the lady Margret.${prompt}
  11360: This must be from when Melvien was still a student of letters.${prompt}
  11361: He quite enjoyed a war game-esque novelty about pioneering developed by none other than the present-day Scouts' Coalition maester.${prompt}
  11362: He was fascinated by the way it represented historically accurate scenarios, and was said to have spent many hours playing it each night before retiring to his chamber.${prompt}
  11363: That is how I recognized the work. It bears the same hallmarks as the illustrations that came with the game itself. Stark imagery, to be sure.${prompt}
  11364: That does jog my memory. It must have been around the same time...${prompt}
  11365: Melvien accompanied his father, Souffriand, then the minister of finance, on a minor expedition into the Ulbuka hinterlands.${prompt}
  11366: It was clear that Melvien would one day be at the forefront of the order, and he was to venture out as part of his coming-of-age ritual.${prompt}
  11367: Yet misfortune befell the two, as Souffriand perished in a survey-related accident.${prompt}
  11368: Melvien's personality took a one-hundred-eighty-degree turn in the aftermath.${prompt}
  11369: He had always been so bright and carefree, but with each passing day his previously smiling visage became increasingly marred with depression and doubt.${prompt}
  11370: Could I honestly say I would have fared better were it I who witnessed the passing of my father firsthand?${prompt}
  11371: Ah, I remember now...${prompt}
  11372: The lady who was sworn to protect the two continues to serve the Couriers' Coalition to this very day.${prompt}
  11373: Perhaps Maester Reginald would be able to answer that which I cannot.${prompt}

  11380: You must twist the knob and see what lies beyond.${prompt}

  11384: First, though, a word of thanks.${prompt}
  11385: If I'd truly been suspected of murder, I--

  11387: M-Maester Margret!?${prompt}
  11388: Tell me, Estelle.${prompt}

  11390: '...It was. But when I heard that some opponents of colonization were looking to frame you, I...${prompt}'
  11391: Aha. The pieces are coming together.${prompt}
  11392: But impersonating another--and a maester, at that--is a serious crime under Adoulinian law.${prompt}
  11393: You understand what that means.${prompt}
  11394: I do.${prompt}
  11395: You will be punished once this incident has been cleared up.${prompt}
  11396: '...Of course.${prompt}'
  11397: Fine. Return to the coalition.${prompt}
  11398: You were involved in the entire debacle, ${name-player}. Tell me what transpired.${prompt}
  11399: Let me take a look.${prompt}
  11400: This report details what you learned from Estienneux, correct?${prompt}
  11401: So then the Couriers' Coalition...${prompt}
  11402: Oho! Maester Reginald?${prompt}
  11403: 'Then this was all the work of ${choice: 0}[Morimar/a man named Morimar].${prompt}'
  11404: This completes that step of the puzzle. We should be able to press on, now.${prompt}
  11405: What you've discovered might mesh perfectly with my theory. “What theory?” I'm glad you asked.${prompt}
  11406: Melvien...was not Hades. Rather, Hades was pretending to be Melvien.${prompt}
  11407: It was an act of possession, if you will.${prompt}
  11408: Let's presume for a moment that its consciousness invaded the body of our former minister of finance.${prompt}
  11409: That would raise the obvious question, no?${prompt}
  11410: Is such a thing even possible?${prompt}
  11411: I have been hung up there for the longest time. I am a woman who requires evidence, not conjecture.${prompt}
  11412: I've run my fingers through every applicable tome and turned up empty at every corner.${prompt}
  11413: That gleam in your eye--you know something, don't you?${prompt}
  11414: |-
    How do you respond?

    Explain about monipulator possession.

  11415: Possessing a monster...? Becoming a monipulator and battling gladiators?${prompt}
  11416: You lost me.${prompt}
  11417: Ah! I think I understand. One can pass their consciousness through such a ring and come to possess another.${prompt}
  11418: That would be quite the feat...but there is no reason for you to stretch the truth.${prompt}
  11419: The wonders of the Middle Lands never cease.${prompt}
  11420: A bolt of lightning. A miraculous recovery. A sudden change in personality.${prompt}
  11421: Melvien lashing out.${prompt}
  11422: Fremilla. Possession. Balamor.${prompt}
  11423: Chero-Machero falling unconscious before our very eyes.${prompt}
  11424: The soul siphon. A stolen spirit.${prompt}
  11425: It's all coming together. If we assume that Melvien really did die that day...${prompt}
  11426: '...Then Hades took that opportunity to breathe new “life” into him.${prompt}'
  11427: Hm? No, there's something else.${prompt}
  11428: Let's posit your conclusion is true. For such a thing to be possible, someone must have made it so.${prompt}
  11429: But...who?${prompt}
  11430: Check up on Estelle behind the Scouts' Coalition.${prompt}
  11431: Oh, it's you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11432: I was expecting Margret to bang the gavel of justice right on my head.${prompt}
  11433: 'She asked me to gather 100 ${keyitem-plural: 1[2]}. Her bark remains worse than her bite.${prompt}'
  11434: But when all was said and done...she thanked me.${prompt}
  11435: “You did me proud by doing Melvien justice.”${prompt}
  11436: Truth be told, I was more concerned for Margret than Melvien.${prompt}
  11437: Your contributions went above and beyond in helping solve this case. Margret gave me a reward for you...and I added a little something on top.${prompt}
  11438: But in return, I would, uh...like that portrait that Margret drew.${prompt}
  11439: '...And while I''m at it, do you still have that letter I used to bring you two together?${prompt}'
  11440: We had used it as a cipher of sorts.${prompt}
  11441: A hidden message appears when you submerge it in a particular type of acid.${prompt}
  11442: The path from here on is for you to decide.${prompt}
  11443: Good day, ${name-player}. I trust Adoulin is treating you well?${prompt}
  11444: Ah, my ${choice-player-gender}[dependable/lovely] assistant! You couldn't have come at a more opportune time.${prompt}
  11445: We've scoured the annals of history, you and I. The secrets of the founder king that we unearthed have rewritten how the city views his entire life!${prompt}

  11449: Hmmm... You do raise an interesting point.${prompt}
  11450: But I'd file that under “curiosity,” not “mystery.”${prompt}
  11451: We can worry about that later. There's something a bit more pressing to focus on first...${prompt}
  11452: Come, now! This is a time for delving into the truth, not blabbering on about something of minimal import!${prompt}
  11453: That's exactly the chord I've been looking to strike!${prompt}

    We cross paths once more at this most important of times.

  11476: Think about it. We haven't the faintest who exactly set us on this trail.${prompt}
  11477: You've crossed the boundaries of time and gleaned information about the founder king's era that no one could ever have hoped to recover.${prompt}
  11478: And how did you do that? By using that imprint device I got for a pittance from some old peddler.${prompt}
  11479: A peddler who claimed he procured it from someone in the Scouts' Coalition.${prompt}

  11498: Hmm... Mayhap there is no other answer.${prompt}
  11499: I've heard everything--including that the two of you were investigating Adoulin's past.${prompt}
  11500: Yes, I was the one who turned the imprint device over to that poor sod and bid him sell it to you.${prompt}

    Then the pieces fall into place...${wait-36: 1}
    But why would you do such a thing?${prompt}
  11502: You'll have to forgive my deception, but it was necessary as part of an ongoing investigation I was conducting.${prompt}
  11503: I used your forays into history in an attempt to glean whatever clues I could.${prompt}
  11504: You see, many moons ago, there was a colleague of mine, several years older but not a touch more intelligent.${prompt}
  11505: He had been searching for Palomel's parents, and just when he had stumbled upon a lead...he vanished.${prompt}
  11506: I took charge of the case afterwards, mind you...${prompt}
  11507: But by then, the trail had run cold. And so here I stand today, empty-handed and without a compass to guide me.${prompt}
  11508: I was thirteen at the time, and twelve years have passed since then...and don't even think about counting the years to deduce information best left unsaid.${prompt}

  11512: '...Hang on. There''s something fishy...${prompt}'
  11513: The imprint device only displays images and memories of those who've touched it, right?${prompt}
  11514: And we know that only four people had access to it--you, me, ${name-player}, and the peddler.${prompt}
  11515: But if we assume that ${name-player}'s story is true, and Palomel appeared in the vision as well...${prompt}

  11523: '${name-player}, we''ve got to head to Yorcia Weald to take back the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'

  11534: What do you mean, you can't remember!? Someone replaced that watertight head of yours with a sieve?${prompt}
  11535: Hmm. Even if you did remember, it wouldn't explain why Palomel ran off with the device in the first place.${prompt}
  11536: Funny, isn't it? We've glimpsed into the most storied memories of Adoulin's past, and now the thing that concerns me the most is Palomel's.${prompt}
  11537: But what am I supposed to do? Stroll over there and say, “Hey, so about that imprint device...”?${prompt}
  11538: Palomel, calm down!${prompt}
  11539: But I know--I know I'm forgetting something!${prompt}
  11540: I've got to remember. I've just got to!${prompt}
  11541: I grabbed the device in hopes that it would show me something.${prompt}
  11542: But all I saw was a kaleidoscope of strange butterflies and a man I didn't recognize.${prompt}
  11543: I know that butterflies mean something, but my knees turned to jelly and I couldn't go any farther.${prompt}
  11544: I don't understand... I don't understand any of this.${prompt}
  11545: I-I figured if the device helped us unravel the history of our fair city it would be able to do the same for me.${prompt}
  11546: But in the end, I learned nothing.${prompt}
  11547: Every time I reach out for the truth, it pulls further away. Why? Why!?${prompt}
  11548: I've got nothing. I'm all alone.${prompt}
  11549: All alone, with no one to take care of me or wipe away my tears when I cry.${prompt}
  11550: But that's fine. I've always been b-by myself. I don't need anyone.${prompt}
  11551: Palomel!${prompt}
  11552: I've always thought of you as my sister. We might not be related by blood, and it's true that you may never find that kind of solace.${prompt}
  11553: But I need you to listen.${prompt}
  11554: The Order of Haverton took you in when you wandered into town dazed and confused, and not long after my parents gave birth to me.${prompt}
  11555: Don't turn your back on all the days we spent together in our youth.${prompt}

    How do you react?

    Hand over the ${number: 2} bayld.

  11608: What a terrible situation. I'd recognize that brim anywhere--that hat almost certainly belonged to Cedricaste.${prompt}
  11609: He was a damn fine man, and a mentor to Margret in her younger years.${prompt}
  11610: How does the saying go? “A person like him only appears once a century”? The coalition is lucky that we had two--Cedricaste and Margret.${prompt}
  11611: Margret held him in the highest regard--we all did--and to think he met such an ignoble end in the hinterlands...${prompt}
  11612: Perhaps you think this morbid, but...would you mind if I had that hat? I promise to treat it with the utmost care.${prompt}
  11613: As talented as Margret is, she is young of age and should be looking toward the future, not beholden to the past.${prompt}

    What do you do?

    Keep it for yourself.${prompt}
  11616: I beg you to reconsider. This article means a lot to the coalition.${prompt}
  11617: You have my sincerest thanks.${prompt}
  11618: Cedricaste taught me that although the eyes may be deceived, the mind can always find the truth.${prompt}
  11619: That's why all forms of information are valuable.${prompt}
  11620: Margret doesn't need to know of our little arrangement.${prompt}
  11621: Consider this not as hush money, but as payment for finding an invaluable artifact of the coalition.${prompt}
  11622: A fine day to you, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/madam]. I trust you are here about a particular set of customers' tabs?${prompt}
  11623: Thank you for your payment. We look forward to serving other members of the Mummers' Coalition.${prompt}
  11624: |-
    Huh? Here to pick up someone's tab?
    Oh, the Mummers' Coalition. Right.${prompt}
  11625: Might be a bit late, but it's better than nothing! Just tell those two to keep better “tabs” on it next time. Bwahaha!${prompt}
  11626: The battle for peace and love is never ending--and I, Eternal Flame, Attache of Amour, dutifully stand at the front lines!${prompt}
  11627: I come bearing a gift requested by dearest Fremilla. Could I trouble you to call for her?${prompt}
  11628: Uh...Attache of Amourrr...?${prompt}
  11629: Ah yes, the man from the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network. Of course. One moment, please.${prompt}
  11630: Ah, lovely Fremilla. I have brought “it” as you requested, together with a huge helping of love.${prompt}
  11631: Oh, Eternal Flame! There is so much I--no, all of Adoulin--can learn from you!${prompt}
  11632: Speak not a word more, for the Attache of Love...
  11633: Oh, heavens me! ${name-player} is here too!${prompt}
  11634: I think I get it! Eternal Flame, when you mentioned love, you must have meant...${prompt}
  11635: '...That you have already secured ${name-player}''s cooperation! My, my, you do think of everything!${prompt}'

    How are you?${prompt}

  11640: Objective! That's the word! Our Eternal Flame friend surely filled you in.${prompt}
  11641: He hasn't?${prompt}

  11643: |-
    No, what I was trying to say is...
    We live in an age where people yearn for peace, so...
  11644: Then it falls to the lovely Fremilla to set the wanderer back on ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] proper course.${prompt}
  11645: You see, it all started when...${prompt}
  11646: The princess?${prompt}
  11647: Well, she hasn't been sitting on her keister in the throne room, that's for sure!${prompt}
  11648: It's all Svenja this, pioneering that...a lesser woman would have doubtless turned to some horrible vice by now!${prompt}
  11649: But back to the situation at hand. It all started when...${prompt}
  11650: M-me?${prompt}
  11651: Let's just say that I've gone through my third pair of shoes this month!${prompt}
  11652: Of course, if we're talking about footwear, then the princess would do best to hire her own personal cobbler.${prompt}
  11653: But back to the situation at hand. It all started when...${prompt}
  11654: Ygnas...
  11655: Have you looked over the budget Chero-Machero proposed for repairing the damage caused in Rala Waterways?${prompt}
  11656: '...${prompt}'
  11657: '...Ygnas?${prompt}'
  11658: Are you even listening!?${prompt}
  11659: Our meeting starts any minute now, and you haven't even given it so much as a glance, have you?${prompt}
  11660: Any minute indeed, Princess. You must get ready.${prompt}
  11661: O-of course. I'll be along shortly.${prompt}
  11662: Princess, is everything...${prompt}
  11663: Every day I'm worried the two of them will break out in a kerfuffle!${prompt}
  11664: But who can blame Ygnas for being stressed? Grenneth is always going on about how he would sneak out of the castle when he was a child...${prompt}
  11665: '...So who''s to say he isn''t doing the same thing now? Who would expect a tottering leafkin to be the city''s highest ruler?${prompt}'
  11666: But he has a sworn duty to guide his people! I don't care how much he wants to get a breath of fresh air!${prompt}
  11667: Doesn't he give two whits about how Arciela is worked up into a tizzy?${prompt}
  11668: But I know you do, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11669: Eh-hem! And so the lovely Fremilla--always one to bring succor to those she loves--came up with a marvelous plan.${prompt}
  11670: The first step is to ascertain exactly why he sneaks out.${prompt}
  11671: That's where Eternal Flame comes in! I had him prepare a special Records of Eminence objective as incentive for someone to help me get to the bottom of this!${prompt}
  11672: And of course I'm pleased as punch that it was you of all people who answered the call.${prompt}
  11673: And now that you know what the deal is, chop-chop!${prompt}
  11674: Stop by again if you learn anything!${prompt}
  11675: '...B-but what about my love and peace?'
  11676: A secrrret path out of the castle?${prompt}
  11677: |-
    If I were a secret path, where would I be located?${wait-36: 2}
    Probably a dusty alley or underground tunnel.${prompt}
  11678: B-but a dutiful guard would not rrreveal such things so flippantly!${prompt}
  11679: Don't worry, ${name-player}. Cynthia already told me everything.${prompt}
  11680: 'The Adoulin family always had a penchant for ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}, stretching back to August himself.${prompt}'
  11681: Sweet Altana above...${prompt}
  11682: That wouldn't be odd by itself...but none of the tomatoes even made it to the kitchen!${prompt}
  11683: I don't care how stressed he is. There's no way Ygnas could have scarfed them all down by himself. So then where...?${prompt}
  11684: I haven't the foggiest!${prompt}
  11685: Then we must follow the trail to solve this most perplexing of cases!${prompt}
  11686: C'mon, ${name-player}--they couldn't have gone far!${prompt}
  11687: And by “c'mon,” I mean “go on.” I'm far too busy to join you.${prompt}
  11688: And just like the last time--come back if you hear anything.${prompt}
  11689: <Mutter> I swear, if I have to buy a fourth pair...
  11690: The mystery of the missing tomatoes? You won't learrrn anything unless you find Ygnas.${prompt}
  11691: I'd scour every corrrner of this town for clues.${prompt}
  11692: So, ${name-player}, what've you learned?${prompt}
  11693: Tarutaru Sauce Supreme...? What on Vana'diel is that?${prompt}
  11694: Why, only the hottest comedic duo to hit Adoulin in the last fifty years!${prompt}
  11695: Hmph! And how do you, of all people, know this?${prompt}
  11696: I...went to see one of their shows.${prompt}
  11697: And where did you find time to do that?${prompt}
  11698: |-
    Never mind. I don't want to know.${wait-36: 2}
    ...And he's performing with them?${prompt}
  11699: '...I don''t think I''ve been so befuddled in my whole life.${prompt}'
  11700: What could he possibly gain by being a two-bit hack of a performer?${prompt}
  11701: He wants to spread the word of our good nation's tomatoes.${prompt}
  11702: And I repeat--how do you, of all people, know this!?${prompt}
  11703: J-just something I heard...${prompt}
  11704: What exactly are you doing with that nonexistent free time of yours!?${prompt}
  11705: ${name-player}, is this true?${prompt}
  11706: 'So let me get this straight. Ygnas has joined a troupe of bumbling wannabes in the hope of boosting sales of the Civic Arboretum''s ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  11707: Well...I suppose he has long been a champion of the arboretum's activities.${prompt}
  11708: But it just doesn't make sense.${prompt}
  11709: 'I should attempt to look on the bright side: at least he''s working for the good of the city when he surreptitiously sneaks out in broad daylight.${prompt}'
  11710: Then Fremilla's judging gaze will have to be averted a little while longer.${prompt}
  11711: ${name-player}, I'm sure this isn't the last we've heard of this debacle. Your services will be required again sometime soon.${prompt}
  11712: And Cynthia stands at the ready!${prompt}
  11713: Uh...you've barely done anything.${prompt}
  11714: |-
    Cynthia?
    Cynthia!
    Get back here!
  11715: You're wondering if Ygnas is still sneaking out?${prompt}
  11716: Fremilla hasn't mentioned anything to me, but rrrest assured that you'll be the first to know.${prompt}
  11717: Greetings, ${name-player}. Let me call Frrremilla for you.${prompt}
  11718: Hidy-ho, ${name-player}! How can Fremilla be of service?${prompt}
  11719: Eh-hem. It's happened again, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11720: Huh? I'm talking about the princess, silly! Now hear me out!${prompt}
  11721: Ygnas...
  11722: Did you check the minutes for the budget meeting on repairing the damage to the Rala Waterways?${prompt}
  11723: '...!${prompt}'
  11724: Y-Ygnas?${prompt}
  11725: Huh? F-Fusilton!?${prompt}
  11726: Ygnas!!!${prompt}
  11727: P-Princess, please forgive me.${prompt}
  11728: I should be the one apologizing, Fusilton. It's not you I'm mad at.${prompt}
  11729: I simply tried a candy that Master Ygnas offered me, and then...${prompt}
  11730: How dare my brother drag you into this, Fusilton! He's got some nerve!${prompt}
  11731: I was planning to ask his opinion on something before the meeting, but it's almost ready to start.${prompt}
  11732: Princess, you must hurry. The meeting is about to begin.${prompt}
  11733: Of course. I'm on my way.${prompt}
  11734: Princess?${prompt}
  11735: So you see, this crafty little ploy of his is how he's sneaking out of the castle!${prompt}
  11736: Therefore! I must call upon you once again to investigate Lord Ygnas.${prompt}
  11737: For the princess's sake, I want you to get to the bottom of this!${prompt}
  11738: Now then, off you go! I'll be eagerly awaiting your report!${prompt}
  11739: You are looking for Lorrrd Ygnas? That sounds like a job more suited to the Scouts' Coalition.${prompt}
  11740: Ah, forrrgive me! It is not the place of a mere guard to speak of such things!${prompt}
  11741: Ah, never have I seen anyone more cute.${prompt}
  11742: Surely you think so, too?${prompt}
  11743: |-
    Who do you look at?
    ${selection-lines}

  11745: In fact, I'd say she's thrice as nice as yesterday.${prompt}
  11746: Hm? What's this now?
  11747: (I got it!)${prompt}
  11748: I thought you might show up, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11749: For some time now, I've been gathering info for the Scouts' Coalition, where I've become quite the superstar, if I do say so myself. “Superstar” being the operative word here.${prompt}
  11750: And now, I've been charged with gathering information on a top secret project.${prompt}
  11751: |-
    Have anything to say?
    ${selection-lines}
    Tell me more.
    Uh-huh.
    Fascinating.${prompt}
  11752: Heh heh heh, I knew you'd be interested.${prompt}
  11753: Say whatever you like, but in the end, you'll be glad I told you. I know you will.${prompt}
  11754: Now, as I was saying...this is a top secret project.${prompt}
  11755: Although, after all we've been through, we're as thick as thieves! I think I can share a few details with you!${prompt}
  11756: Previously, you helped me gather information on the age of pioneers that served as the basis for the Great Expedition.${prompt}
  11757: Of course, I'm the one who practically handed you the clues and shoved you out the door, but that's neither here nor there.${prompt}
  11758: So, do you know about the game based on the Great Expedition?${prompt}
  11759: Its name is...wait for it..."The Great Expedition"! It's a board game thought up by Margret back when she was a student.${prompt}
  11760: The game was extremely popular among the other students at the time.${prompt}
  11761: Margret frequently visited the Celennia Memorial Library in order to work on an expansion that closely followed history.${prompt}
  11762: And so, what do you think happened as a result of that?${prompt}
  11763: It followed history exactly. Nobody could defeat the threat that faced the forests of Ulbuka.${prompt}
  11764: Gradually, the game's popularity began to wane, until eventually, people stopped playing it altogether.${prompt}
  11765: And that's the long and short of it.${prompt}
  11766: You might think it best to leave the past alone, but now the Scouts' Coalition is digging around for information necessary to develop a new game.${prompt}
  11767: The theme for the game is “living in harmony with the forest”!${prompt}
  11768: I think you can see where this is going... I've been tasked with serving as the head of the team responsible.${prompt}
  11769: So I've gone from learning about the past to “pioneering” a greater future!${prompt}
  11770: I agonized for days and nights until it finally hit me.${prompt}
  11771: If you want to learn about the forest, then you should ask the forest itself. Brilliant, no?${prompt}
  11772: So basically, I decided it'd be best to ask the leafkin, since they reside in the forest.${prompt}
  11773: Of course, I'm going to have to look like a leafkin myself if I'm to have any hopes of talking to them.${prompt}
  11774: 'I hear that if you eat ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, you will look like a leafkin for a brief period of time. “Brief” being the operative word here.${prompt}'
  11775: In other words, what I'm trying to say is...${prompt}
  11776: 'Go out there and find me some ${item-plural: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  11777: Once you do, I'll be able to set the course of Adoulin's future!${prompt}
  11778: More importantly, it'll give me a chance to get close to Yocile! That's just an added bonus, of course...${prompt}
  11779: Go on now! Our future depends on you!${prompt}
  11780: Grrr... “Get close to Yocile”!? W-we'll see about that!${prompt}
  11781: 'I need you to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  11782: I don't suppose the antiquary has any...${prompt}
  11783: 'What''s that? You need some ${item-plural: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  11784: Forgive me, I'm just a poor little antiquary. I do not carry such items.${prompt}
  11785: Wh-what's that? You want the scoop on leafkin candy?${prompt}
  11786: 'Well, there''s something called ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} that can be obtained at a festival in the Middle Lands.${prompt}'
  11787: Did you f-f-find that information useful?${prompt}

    <Leafkin> what I'm saying!?${prompt}
  11846: Trust me, it isn't hard to understand that simple mind of yours.${prompt}

    <Leafkin> Oh, that reminds me!

    <Leafkin> I'm on my way!
    <Leafkin> Wait for me, Miss Yocile!
  11851: Th-that's not gonna happen if I've got anything to say about it!
  11852: <Leafkin> Urgh!${prompt}
  11853: Hmm... You neglect your work for this? That's minus twenty marks.
  11854: |-
    So, about this new game...
    Who do you think came up with the idea for it?${prompt}
  11855: That's right. Lord Ygnas.${prompt}
  11856: That was pretty wise of him to use this game to get the people of the city to live in harmony with the forest.${prompt}
  11857: Do you recall that I once said that there are no witnesses to history?${prompt}
  11858: That only physical evidence can serve to prove what happened before?${prompt}
  11859: What if we applied this logic to the future?${prompt}
  11860: That which has yet to happen can be either black or white, depending on the information at hand.${prompt}
  11861: Fascinating, no?${prompt}
  11862: It's enough to make me wonder if hiring him was a mistake.${prompt}
  11863: I hope he dies a hundred times over!${prompt}
  11864: What!? That leafkin was responsible for proposing the new board game!?${prompt}
  11865: And to think I was trying to ask all those questions... How embarrassing!${prompt}
  11866: Wh-what!? Lord Ygnas was talking to some young and beautiful waitress!?${prompt}
  11867: Why would he even bother when Fremilla, one of the greatest beauties in the land, is right here!?${prompt}
  11868: What's that? You think I should be focusing on the new board game?${prompt}
  11869: I already know about "The Great Expedition."${prompt}
  11870: W-wait! You've heard of it, too!?${prompt}
  11871: It was in the storehouse, but there's a new version now?${prompt}
  11872: Make up your mind, would you!? Do you know about it or not!?${prompt}
  11873: <Sigh> How can I put this? It is a game that you play on a board...${prompt}
  11874: '...and he''s been making a similar one based on the theme of living in harmony with the forest...${prompt}'
  11875: '...so that the people in the city playing it can learn about the future of Adoulin?${prompt}'
  11876: That's the line he's spouting?${prompt}
  11877: Hmm... I suppose a game does make it more approachable, and educational at that.${prompt}
  11878: Although, I've got this gnawing feeling about that waitress...${prompt}
  11879: ${name-player}, it looks like I'm going to need to call upon your services once more!${prompt}
  11880: Please let me know once you find out what's going on.${prompt}
  11881: The waitrrress she's talking about must be Yocile.${prompt}
  11882: I doubt there to be any impropriety between her and Lord Ygnas.${prompt}
  11883: Ah, but you wouldn't be interested in my musings. Please, forrrget I mentioned anything.${prompt}
  11884: Hm? You're looking for Master Sangy?${prompt}
  11885: In that case, you should check with the Mummers' Coalition. I've seen him around there before.${prompt}
  11886: What!? Master Ygnas was playing a game at the Mummers' Coalition!?${prompt}
  11887: Now we've got him by the leaf...tail?${prompt}
  11888: I've heard that the Mummers' Coalition is popular with young men courting their female acquaintances.${prompt}
  11889: Clearly, he's simply using this game to scout out the location of his next tryst!${prompt}
  11890: What? You're saying it's to help lift the spirits of the people in the city?${prompt}
  11891: And as sales rise at the Mummers' Coalition, it will help generate the revenue needed to repair the Rala Waterways?${prompt}
  11892: In that case, maybe his motives were a bit more pure.${prompt}
  11893: Which means that it looks like Lady Fremilla's judgment will be staid once more.${prompt}
  11894: Well, ${name-player}! I'm sure I'll need to call upon you again sometime. Thanks in advance!${prompt}
  11895: Crooked Die!${prompt}
  11896: Cynthia, what is that you're going on about!?${prompt}
  11897: Hey, Cynthia! Wait up!
  11898: A pleasurrre as always, ${name-player}. If you're looking for Fremilla, she--${prompt}
  11899: You won't be so lucky this time! I'll show you what crooked dice can do!${prompt}
  11900: Ahem. Why, ${name-player}, you're just the ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] I was looking for. I assume you know what I need.${prompt}
  11901: Ugh! You're impossible! I'm talking about Princess Arciela, you big oaf!${prompt}
  11902: Ygnas...
  11903: I had a brief chat with Melvien's successor, who is adamant that we cannot allocate any more funds to the ongoing repairs in Rala Waterways without cutting something elsewhere.${prompt}
  11904: '...?${prompt}'
  11905: Um, Ygnas? Are you listening?${prompt}
  11906: Princess, you do realize that that's Geosuke, right?${prompt}
  11907: Wh-what!?${prompt}
  11908: Ygnas, why you--!${prompt}
  11909: '...!${prompt}'
  11910: G-Geosuke, please forgive me. I'm not upset with you, it's just that my brother...${prompt}
  11911: |-
    <Sigh>...
    How can we secure funds for Rala Waterways without Ygnas's approval?${prompt}
  11912: P-Princess!!! I thought I saw Ygnas running around here, but...why are there two of them!?${prompt}
  11913: Maybe I'm just imagining things, given how I've been working myself to the bone these past few weeks.${prompt}
  11914: Um, Fremilla? One of them is Geosuke.${prompt}
  11915: Geo-whosywhatsit?${prompt}
  11916: <Sigh>${prompt}
  11917: P-Princess?${prompt}
  11918: Now do you get it? Ygnas flits out of the castle like a bird out of a nest without any care for what happens in his absence!${prompt}
  11919: So this time, ${name-player}, I expect results!${prompt}
  11920: Get out there, track down Ygnas, and report back to me immediately!${prompt}
  11921: Geosuke? He cerrrtainly is the popular figure in our city.${prompt}
  11922: But let's leave the juicy gossip for a later date. I've got worrrk to do.${prompt}
  11923: 'And so do you--there''s a different leafkin you''ve got to worry about right now: Ygnas.${prompt}'
  11924: Ygnas was playing footsie with Midras in Yorcia Weald!?${prompt}
  11925: Why on Vana'diel would he go all the way out there?${prompt}
  11926: Wait--I get it! Last time we caught him playing Boom or Bust, so this time he wanted to go far, far away from the watchful gaze of the lovely Fremilla!${prompt}
  11927: Oh-ho, but he has underestimated me! My web of informants spreads far and wide!${prompt}
  11928: He wanted to remove the fetters that shackled Midras's spirits?${prompt}
  11929: Well, if it helps the tomatoes taste better...${prompt}
  11930: I guess you're right, Cynthia, and I suppose the pursuit of knowledge is a worthy goal...${prompt}
  11931: '...but I still think we should keep a watchful eye on him.${prompt}'
  11932: And so, ${name-player}, you know what you must do!${prompt}
  11933: Go after the little troublemaker and figure out what his next plan is!${prompt}
  11934: Lord Ygnas bounded out the frrront gate just a short while ago.${prompt}
  11935: He's got to be around here somewhere...but where?${prompt}
  11936: But I dare not concern myself with his affairs. I am but a simple guard.${prompt}
  11937: Hey there, ${name-player}! Against all odds, Nashu has graduated from his training and become a full-fledged exorcist!${prompt}
  11938: It's a good thing too, because I wouldn't want to be in the way if he was turned down.${prompt}
  11939: ${name-player}! ${name-player}! Over here!${prompt}
  11940: How long has it been? Days? Months? Years? I lost track!${prompt}
  11941: Really? That long? Well, all that matters to me is that you're healthy and happy.${prompt}
  11942: Being an exorcist is hard work and...wait, why did I come here again?${prompt}
  11943: Knowing you, probably to shirk your training.${prompt}
  11944: Why, not in the slightest! I am scheduled to undergo some practical training before my upcoming pilgrimage!${prompt}
  11945: At least you have a rational explanation this time. Best of luck.${prompt}
  11946: And so, ${name-player}, it's off to Yorcia Weald with me!${prompt}
  11947: I know that we've got so much to catch up on, but I really must be off!${prompt}
  11948: But I promise--we'll have a nice, long chat after I become High Exorcist!${prompt}
  11949: See you around!${prompt}
  11950: Nashu? He ran off west, in the direction of Yorcia Weald.${prompt}
  11951: Studying in the order's sacred halls is important, but practical training plays a vital role as well.${prompt}
  11952: Exorcists must always be looking to improve our skills if we are to keep Adoulin safe from outside threats!${prompt}
  11953: Huh? I think you're going to have to start again from the beginning.${prompt}
  11954: You and Ygnas traipsed around in the jungle and vanquished the Velkk king?${prompt}
  11955: And the exorcists helped, too.${prompt}
  11956: And the Blackthorn Coven. My, the two of you were quite busy.${prompt}
  11957: Witches!? You worked with witches!?${prompt}
  11958: Hang on--Cynthia, why do you know all this?${prompt}
  11959: Because unlike you, I was paying attention.${prompt}
  11960: To whom? ${name-player} never said anything about witches!${prompt}
  11961: To Ygnas.${prompt}
  11962: Wait--let me get this straight.${prompt}
  11963: Am I the only one in the entire castle who hasn't heard this story!?${prompt}
  11964: I must be going crazy. Voices...I hear voices!${prompt}
  11965: Don't worry about her. She gets like this sometimes.${prompt}
  11966: I'll calm her down.${prompt}
  11967: Have a good rest of your day, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11968: ${name-player}, may I have a moment of your time?${prompt}
  11969: Lord Ygnas rrrequested that I give this to you.${prompt}
  11970: With this insignia, the Order of Gorney will offer you some services not available to the ordinary public.${prompt}
  11971: Looks a bit like a leafkin, doesn't it?${prompt}
  11972: Here you go.${prompt}
  11973: With how Fremilla's been in a tizzy the past few days, I wager it'll be a while before she calls on you again.${prompt}
  11974: Ahem... I'm sorry for all of the trouble the other day.${prompt}
  11975: Although, worry not, my friend! As you can see, Fremilla is back to her usual calm, cool, and collected self!${prompt}
  11976: Now then, I'd like for us to review Ygnas's conduct once again before the wise and honorable Fremilla makes her verdict.${prompt}
  11977: Let's go over what's transpired so far, shall we?${prompt}
  11978: Hmm... First of all...${prompt}
  11979: 'When Ygnas went to ${zone: 0[2]}, who was it he wanted to see?${prompt}'

    Who did he go to see?

    Vicious Vorahal.
    Chalvava.
    Mukki.
    Sorry, I don't remember.${prompt}
  11981: I'm disappointed in you, ${name-player}... I guess I misjudged your abilities.${prompt}
  11982: Please come back when you have the answers I seek.${prompt}
  11983: ${name-player}, I hope you're ready this time. Now, let's go over the details of my investigation once more.${prompt}
  11984: Okay... Tell me, what was the reason for his visit?${prompt}
  11985: |-
    What was the purpose of his visit?
    ${selection-lines}
    Watch the raptor fights.
    Construct a secret base.
    Collect ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}.
    Sorry, I don't remember.${prompt}
  11986: 'So you''re saying he went to watch the raptor fights with ${choice: 6}[Vorahal/Chalvava/Mukki]...${prompt}'
  11987: Vorahal... Umm, isn't he a raptor?${prompt}
  11988: Mukki... That's actually a type of vegetable grown by Faomahd.${prompt}
  11989: Chalvava... She's never been to see the raptor fights.${prompt}
  11990: H-hey... I know that! Come on now, ${name-player}. You need to take this more seriously!${prompt}
  11991: 'In other words, he went to go construct a secret base with ${choice: 6}[Vorahal/Chalvava/Mukki]...${prompt}'
  11992: Chalvava... The only thing she makes is--vegetables.${prompt}
  11993: 'So, he visited ${choice: 6}[Vorahal/Chalvava/Mukki] to collect some ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  11994: 'Yes, Cynthia said the same thing--lucky guess, I''m sure. He apparently absconded with the ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} for some reason.${prompt}'
  11995: Although afterwards, they were never delivered to the castle's kitchen like they were supposed to be...${prompt}
  11996: Then, upon chasing after him...${prompt}
  11997: 'There was a comedy show being held in ${zone: 0[2]}. What was the name of that comedic duo again?${prompt}'
  11998: |-
    What was the name of the comedic duo?
    ${selection-lines}
    Tarutaru Sauce.
    The Dribbling Dopes.
    The Mighty Maidens.
    Sorry, I don't remember.${prompt}
  11999: 'I see... And what were the ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} to be used for again?${prompt}'
  12000: |-
    What was their purpose?
    ${selection-lines}
    To be eaten.
    Props for the show.
    A gift for the audience.
    Sorry, I don't remember.${prompt}
  12001: 'So, you''re telling me he was going to eat them if he got hungry while watching the comedy show by ${choice: 6}[Tarutaru Sauce/the Dribbling Dopes/the Mighty Maidens]?${prompt}'
  12002: The Dribbling Dopes? They're a couple of dancers...${prompt}
  12003: The Mighty Maidens? They're that popular girl duo...${prompt}
  12004: Tarutaru Sauce... One of them's a notoriously big eater, but he didn't eat them...${prompt}
  12005: 'You mean they were supposed to be used as props by ${choice: 6}[Tarutaru Sauce/The Dribbling Dopes/The Mighty Maidens] for their comedy show?${prompt}'
  12006: Tarutaru Sauce... They use a mannequin as a prop, but that's about it...${prompt}
  12007: 'So, basically, they were to be given as a present to the fans attending the comedy show by ${choice: 6}[Tarutaru Sauce/The Dribbling Dopes/The Mighty Maidens].${prompt}'
  12008: 'In the end, it was all an attempt to increase the popularity of ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} with the people of Adoulin.${prompt}'
  12009: Now, let's go over the development of the new board game by the Scouts' Coalition. What was the theme of it again?${prompt}
  12010: |-
    What was the theme?
    ${selection-lines}
    The Great Expedition.
    Living in harmony with the forest.
    The popularity of the leafkin.
    Sorry, I don't remember.${prompt}
  12011: Okay... And what was the purpose of developing the board game?${prompt}
  12012: |-
    Why was the game developed?
    ${selection-lines}
    To better ${item-singular: 0[2]} sales.
    To educate the townsfolk.
    To get close to a cafe employee...
    Sorry, I don't remember.${prompt}
  12013: 'So this game based on ${choice: 6}[the Great Expedition/living in harmony with the forest/leafkin popularity] was made in an attempt to increase the sales of ${item-plural: 0[2]}...${prompt}'
  12014: The Great Expedition? That was the theme of their previous game.${prompt}
  12015: Leafkin popularity? That was actually a business opportunity dreamed up by Geosuke and some others.${prompt}
  12016: 'Living in harmony with the forest has nothing to do with boosting the sales of ${item-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  12017: 'So this game based on ${choice: 6}[The Great Expedition/living in harmony with the forest/leafkin popularity] was simply a ploy to get close to a waitress at the cafe...${prompt}'
  12018: Living in harmony with the forest... I'm not sure what that has to do with getting closer to a waitress.${prompt}
  12019: 'So the thinking was that this game based on ${choice: 6}[The Great Expedition/living in harmony with the forest/leafkin popularity] would help educate the people of Adoulin...${prompt}'
  12020: Apparently, this whole thing came about due to a suggestion he made to the Scouts' Coalition.${prompt}
  12021: Now, I'd like to talk about the man who was popular with those game fanatics throughout the Mummers' Coalition. What did they call him again?${prompt}
  12022: |-
    What was he referred to as?
    ${selection-lines}
    The man in black.
    Golden Pioneer.
    Viridian Aristocrat.
    Sorry, I don't remember.${prompt}
  12023: I see... And why was he playing the game again?${prompt}
  12024: |-
    What was his reason for playing the game?
    ${selection-lines}
    To lift the people's spirits.
    To collect Mummers' Medals.
    To scout the location of his next date.
    Sorry, I don't remember.${prompt}
  12025: 'You''re claiming that he wanted to collect Mummers'' Medals in order to be lovingly referred to as “${choice: 6}[the man in black/the Golden Pioneer/the Viridian Aristocrat]” by the game''s fans?${prompt}'
  12026: The man in black... That was actually Teodor...${prompt}
  12027: The Golden Pioneer... I'm pretty sure that was what Levil called himself...${prompt}
  12028: Collecting Mummers' Medals? That was Levil's reason for playing.${prompt}
  12029: 'So he went there so often to scout a location for his next tryst that he became referred to as “${choice: 6}[the man in black/the Golden Pioneer/the Viridian Aristocrat]”?${prompt}'
  12030: Scouting date locations? I don't think that was it...${prompt}
  12031: 'So essentially, he tried so hard to cheer up the people that he came to be referred to among them as “${choice: 6}[the man in black/the Golden Pioneer/the Viridian Aristocrat]”?${prompt}'
  12032: It resulted in increased sales at the Mummers' Coalition, which helped generate more revenue for repairing the Rala Waterways.${prompt}
  12033: Moving along, let's talk about the time Ygnas went searching for somebody at the Inventors' Coalition. Who was he looking for again?${prompt}
  12034: |-
    Who was he looking for?
    ${selection-lines}
    Amchuchu.
    Midras.
    Cid.
    Sorry, I don't remember.${prompt}

  12036: |-
    Why was Ygnas searching for them?
    ${selection-lines}
    To remove what shackled their spirits.
    To learn the recipe for an explosive.
    To develop a new type of airship.
    Sorry, I don't remember.${prompt}
  12037: 'You''re trying to say that he went looking for ${choice: 6}[Amchuchu/Midras/Cid] to ask for a recipe on how to make explosives?${prompt}'
  12038: Amchuchu was already at the Inventors' Coalition. There was no need to look for her.${prompt}
  12039: Cid... He was in Bastok, not at the Inventors' Coalition.${prompt}
  12040: Midras... He's an expert with explosives, but I don't think that was Ygnas's reason.${prompt}
  12041: 'Okay, he was looking for ${choice: 6}[Amchuchu/Midras/Cid] in order to develop a new type of airship...${prompt}'
  12042: Midras... It may be a dream of his to create a new airship, but I don't think that was Ygnas's reason.${prompt}
  12043: 'So he was searching for ${choice: 6}[Amchuchu/Midras/Cid] in order to remove the fetters that shackled their heart...${prompt}'
  12044: And by removing those shackles, he thought it would help further the research into boosting the yield of the vegetable harvest.${prompt}
  12045: 'Now then, tell me about the time the newly appointed exorcist Nashu was in trouble at ${zone: 0[2]}. What kind of trouble happened to him again?${prompt}'
  12046: |-
    What happened to him?
    ${selection-lines}
    Attacked by the Velkk.
    Attacked by umbrils.

  12047: Yes... Tell me, ${name-player}, who was it that saved you and Nashu?${prompt}

    ${selection-lines}
    Grennith.
    Fusilton.
    Ygnas.
    Sorry, I don't remember.${prompt}
  12049: 'So you worked together with ${choice: 7}[Grennith/Fusilton/Ygnas] to fend off the attack from the ${choice: 6}[Velkk/umbrils/Blackthorn Coven].${prompt}'
  12050: Grennith is pretty tough, but I don't think that's the right answer here.${prompt}
  12051: Fusilton is a weakling. It definitely wasn't him.${prompt}
  12052: The umbrils? They never attacked Nashu...${prompt}
  12053: The Blackthorn Coven? They're friends of Nashu's.${prompt}
  12054: The Velkk king's attempt at revenge ended in failure, and Nashu successfully passed his training exam with flying colors.${prompt}
  12055: That concludes my investigation. Now it's time for the wise and honorable Fremilla to render her verdict!${prompt}
  12056: Ygnas's actions are hereby found to be...${prompt}
  12057: Completely justified!${prompt}
  12058: Of course, that only goes for his actions covered by the scope of this investigation...${prompt}
  12059: But this is not what Princess Arciela is expecting to hear! I feel so sorry for her!${prompt}
  12060: ${name-player}, don't you think so, too!?${prompt}
  12061: However, there's no need to worry...${prompt}
  12062: I had a feeling something like this might happen, so I've already prepared my next move!${prompt}
  12063: 'I call it “Operation: Give Sweets to Arciela to Make Her Feel Better!”${prompt}'
  12064: 'Alright then, ${name-player}... I need you to get ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} for me!${prompt}'
  12065: 'Alright then, ${name-player}... I need you to get ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} and ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]} for me!${prompt}'
  12066: That will be sure to have the princess singing with glee!${prompt}
  12067: Report back to Ploh Trishbahk when you're finished.${prompt}
  12068: Okay, thanks again for your help on this!${prompt}
  12069: You wish to confirm the sweets Fremilla rrrequested for Princess Arciela?${prompt}

  12072: Once you have what I need, rrreturn here and I will summon Fremilla.${prompt}

  12074: Now then, please wait herrre a moment while I get Fremilla for you.${prompt}
  12075: Yes, this will do just nicely...${prompt}
  12076: I'm certain this will be just the thing to lift Princess Arciela's spirits.${prompt}
  12077: Although, this whole situation has got me thinking...${prompt}
  12078: As long as she continues to face the pressure of her official duties, this is only likely to be a temporary fix at best.${prompt}

  12462: Hello there, adventurer. My name is Octavien and I hail from the Order of Orvail.${prompt}
  12463: So, my adventuring friend, how long did it take for you to reach Adoulin?${prompt}
  12464: |-
    Heh heh heh, I assure you my powers of perspicacity are not the same as omniscience.
    'Tis but a trifle to tell outsiders from those of Adoulinian stock. One's gait, ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] posture...or even the powers that lay dormant within ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] provide ample evidence as to ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] identity.${prompt}
  12465: Perhaps I am right about something else as well. Do you happen to know of “runes”--magical emblems that have been passed down for generations?${prompt}
  12466: |-
    Know you of “runes”?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    Sadly, I do not.${prompt}
  12467: |-
    Aha, I knew it! What an enlightened individual I've come across.
    Still, possessing a mere passing knowledge of runes is insufficient to fully comprehend the mysteries contained within. Let me provide you with a more thorough explanation.${prompt}
  12468: Runes have existed since the age of the gods and are considered sacred, or so certain legends portend.${prompt}
  12469: Still more legends assert that the symbols first emerged from the north, on the continent of Rhazowa.${prompt}
  12470: However, all accounts seem to agree that each letter in this mystical array harbors powers of thaumaturgic significance. Moreover, this special magic can only be released by a few talented individuals.${prompt}
  12471: Those able to unlock the true nature of these uncharacteristically powerful characters are dubbed “rune fencers.”${prompt}
  12472: Now as to why I asked my prior question and possibly bored you with a story as old as time immemorial:${prompt}
  12473: |-
    I have reason to believe you are one of the chosen, one of those who can unlock the true potential of these runes.
    Call it runesmith's intuition.${prompt}
  12474: That should be sufficient background information. After all, my true purpose isn't to flaunt my vast intellect, but to awaken the latent rune powers of the chosen, per the order of the Order of Orvail.${prompt}
  12475: But I digress. Should you truly wish to walk the path of the rune fencer, I would be more than happy to guide you.${prompt}
  12476: The road is long, strenuous, and--above all else--steep. Many runesmith cragsmen have lost their foothold during their climb only to plummet to the darkest depths of concession, their days spent shrouded in shame.${prompt}
  12477: Proclivities and propensities, aversions and antitheses...these are the cards you are constantly dealt to deal with your opposition!${prompt}
  12478: Yet the first step starts with runic theory, then a hop to sparring, skipping to field practice, and finally a jump to applying your years of experience. The regimen is so harsh that many students often step down in dismay after the first few years.${prompt}
  12479: |-
    What do you think?
    ${selection-lines}
    The...first few years...?
    Slay me now.${prompt}
  12480: |-
    Maybe I should be more forthright in my explanation.
    That's the straight and narrow way of learning the craft. There is a shortcut now, its only shortcomings being the risks that accompany it.${prompt}
  12481: Certain practitioners have, in these recent years, begun engraving runes into their flesh.${prompt}
  12482: Those who favor this route are often routed in battle...be they not accompanied by an absorbent mind, quick reflexes, and an adaptive body.${prompt}
  12483: Should you fail to keep those traits carved upon your soul, you shall forever lose the ability to manipulate runes...${prompt}
  12484: Knowing this, do you still wish to proceed and inscribe symbols upon your skin that could very well spell your own death?${prompt}
  12485: |-
    Inscribe the runes?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I'm ready.
    No, my life is too precious!${prompt}
  12486: |-
    I suppose my intuition was wrong after all.
    Very well...but do not hesitate to return should you have a change of heart.${prompt}
  12487: |-
    So, you return.
    Have you decided to tiptoe along the path of runic arts and to always be prepared for a perilous fall from grace?${prompt}
  12488: |-
    Tiptoe the path of runic enlightenment?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, and may I never stray!
    Nope, I'm not that committed.${prompt}
  12489: |-
    You think I would tear up as if you were tearing my heart in twain?
    No, I think not. Be on your way.${prompt}
  12490: Straight and true flies the arrow of righteousness, and so--in a similar fashion--has your answer hit its mark.${prompt}
  12491: Your first step on the way to runic enlightenment will take you into the heart of darkness...for you must procure an atrament strong enough to overcome your body's resistance to runic material.${prompt}
  12492: |-
    You are charged with collecting the proper ingredient to create this ink.
    Keep in mind that I send you upon this task not because of my revulsion toward menial labor, but so that you may familiarize yourself with what will become your new essence.${prompt}

  12495: I wish you all the best, my friend.${prompt}
  12496: |-
    I can tell by the smile you're wearing that your travels did not overly wear you down.
    Wait but a moment and you shall have your atrament.${prompt}

    And so the preparations are complete.
    That incantation may have looked simple to the untrained eye, but that is only because I've distilled the process down to its very essence.${prompt}
  12499: How is your constitution? While inscribing runes may not leave scars, some report that the emotional stress of the event is quite overpowering...${prompt}
  12500: Not to mention the physical pain.${prompt}
  12501: Well, shall we begin?${prompt}
  12502: |-
    Begin the inscription?
    ${selection-lines}
    P-please be gentle!

    That's wholly understandable, considering what's at stake.

  12532: I contend that my intentions were truly altruistic.${prompt}

  12537: I wanted to see if you had the fire in your belly to brave the searing pain of inscription and your defeats in heated combat that are sure to come eventually.${prompt}
  12538: Furthermore, even someone as loquacious as me doesn't have time to spend on every adventurer just looking to impress ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] comrades.${prompt}

  12890: To be frrrank with you, I don't understand much about this whole ordeal. What I do know is that you need a yantric planchette to even have a prayer of finding the real entrance.${prompt}
  12891: These yantric planchettes don't make themselves, my pet. They're crrrafted from only the finest yggrete--and no one can fashion them but me.${prompt}

    I'm usually not one to be concerned about the prrractical implications of such things, but think of the possibilities!
    ${wait-36: 2}I said think, damn you!
    <Sigh> I'm sure those inventors back in Western Adoulin will trade you trinkets for even just a drop of the stuff.${prompt}
  12897: I'm more than just sharp claws and a prrretty face--I'm also the only one who can make yantric planchettes! That's why I'm here!${prompt}
  12898: You're completely useless unless you trade me yggrrrete so I can make one.${prompt}
  12899: Why? <Scowl> Because you can't find the extra-dimensional entrrrances and step inside without one!${prompt}
  12900: <Sigh>${prompt}
  12901: Stop looking at me like that. No, I don't know why it worrrks that way, okay? That's why I've got to study these things!${prompt}
  12902: Oh, and another thing, tenderpaws--once you've used a yantric planchette, it crrrumbles into dust and becomes completely useless.${prompt}
  12903: Of course, it goes without saying that the yggrete becomes totally useless, too. And before you ask--no, I won't give a damn if you come back to me crrrying and bawling. I'll just laugh in your face.${prompt}
  12904: Yggrete are petrified pieces of wood from a tree said to contain mystical powerrrs. But they're hard as rock--just like your head, evidently--so you can think of them as stones.${prompt}
  12905: They come in many colors depending on the latent energies within. It's those enerrrgies I need to make a yantric planchette.${prompt}
  12906: The color of the yggrete deterrrmines what entrance it leads to. See how nice I am, spending all my time to supply you with this imporrrtant information?${prompt}
  12907: |-
    “Why are they called yggrete?” Really?
    <Sigh> There's no helping some people. Suffice to say, it's one of nature's grrreatest mysteries.${prompt}
  12908: So if you come across any yggrete, just trrrade them to me so I can make you a yantric planchette. With that, you can go bash some brains in to help me find what I need! I trust you can do that much.${prompt}
  12909: So, you want to know what yggrete shards are? Someone really needs to slap some sense into you--might as well be me. They're...sharrrds of yggrete.${prompt}
  12910: I shouldn't fault you too much, though, because they aren't used in the same way. No, these are used to call monsterrrs to you.${prompt}
  12911: They can also be condensed into mweya plasm...if you desirrre.${prompt}
  12912: Use them once and they become inert and sterrrile, just like...never mind. Don't be an idiot by using them when you don't mean to.${prompt}
  12913: Yggzi beads are another forrrm of yggrete. You know, magic and all.${prompt}
  12914: By infusing a yantric planchette with these mystic beads, you can prevent certain monsters from approaching you--now, if only they could stop idiots from apprrroaching me.${prompt}
  12915: Each yantric planchette can be infused with up to three yggzi beads. Might as well try them for yourself, no?${prompt}
  12916: Having all this talent is tough enough--I don't need to be doing other people's dirrrty work, too.${prompt}
  12917: They can also be turned into mweya plasm just like yggrete shards. A plebeian like you doesn't need any of that, though.${prompt}

  12931: Maybe I shouldn't get so frrrustrated at you for this, but I can't put multiple stones of the same type onto one yantric planchette. The energies would cancel each other out.${prompt}

  13044: Ygnas...${prompt}
  13045: Wh...when did this all start?${prompt}
  13046: Right after he began recruiting adventurers from the Middle Lands.${prompt}
  13047: He began complaining of constant fatigue, and would sleep practically the whole day away.${prompt}
  13048: I was still able to exchange words with him the last time we met, however... I had no idea that...${prompt}
  13049: To think the curse actually exists...${prompt}
  13050: Its existence is much more plausible than many are likely to think.${prompt}
  13051: There is an account of a haunting that dates back to the Great Expedition, a time when the founder king's influence had just begun to wane.${prompt}
  13052: The ruler at the time claimed that the founder king's ghost appeared in his bedchamber, warning that any attempt to enter the forest would bring with it grave consequences.${prompt}
  13053: Soon after that ominous apparition's visit, myriad disasters erupted throughout the capital.${prompt}
  13054: The coincidence was too horrifying to ignore. The people immediately called a halt to colonization, erected a new tomb for the first king beneath the city, and held a prolonged vigil to appease him.${prompt}
  13055: As a result, the ghost stopped appearing and the disasters abated. Some will likely claim that this is nothing but an old wives' tale, but I assure you it is not. This story can be corroborated by any number of scholarly chronicles.${prompt}
  13056: If it is indeed a curse, then perhaps we can lift it like any other?${prompt}
  13057: Has anyone tried casting Cursna upon him?${prompt}
  13058: |-
    Cast Cursna?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'll give it the old adventurer's try.
    Psh, it's bound to fail.${prompt}
  13059: ${name-player} casts Cursna.${prompt}
  13060: It has absolutely no effect on Ygnas!${prompt}
  13061: If no one else has, please allow me to try.${prompt}
  13062: Svenja casts Cursna.${prompt}
  13063: |-
    Unbelievable...
    This has got to be the single strongest curse I have ever encountered.${prompt}
  13064: I knew we should never have set foot in the hinterland!${prompt}
  13065: To neglect the founder king's wisdom is to seal our own doom!${prompt}
  13066: We have disfigured the forest. It is only natural that it seeks rrrevenge.${prompt}
  13067: Are you saying that it's empirically impossible for us to coexist with the jungle?${prompt}
  13068: That the only thing we can do is mutilate each other beyond recognition?${prompt}
  13069: 'Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} begins to glow a light green.${prompt}'
  13070: (Can you hear me, ${name-player}?)${prompt}
  13071: A ghostly echo reverberates inside your head.${prompt}
  13072: (My name is Ygnas S. Adoulin.)${prompt}
  13073: (I am brother to Arciela, who stands next to you.)${prompt}
  13074: ${name-player}...?${prompt}
  13075: (There is no time for beating around the bush--so to speak--so let me say this right now.)${prompt}
  13076: (${name-player}...)${prompt}
  13077: (Do not, under any circumstances, cease colonization.)${prompt}
  13078: What's going on, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13079: |-
    What? A strange voice?
    No, I don't hear anything like that at all...${prompt}
  13080: (Furthermore, much more important issues lie before us than the lifting of this curse.)${prompt}
  13081: The voice is Ygnas's!?${prompt}
  13082: '......${prompt}'
  13083: You remember what Rosulatia told us, don't you?${prompt}
  13084: |-
    Do you?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  13085: |-
    What were they?
    ${selection-lines}
    Aaask...the king...
    Aaask...the queen...${prompt}
  13086: Yes, that's it! You didn't have to add the funny accent, though.${prompt}
  13087: She said, “Ask the king,” so...${prompt}
  13088: What if the king she was referring to isn't their ruler...${prompt}
  13089: But my brother, who's been transformed into a leafkin?${prompt}
  13090: Arciela...I am completely lost. What in the heavens have you been talking about?${prompt}
  13091: ${name-player} says ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] can communicate with Ygnas.${prompt}
  13092: So, ${name-player}, what's my brother saying?${prompt}
  13093: (Trouble yourself not with breaking the curse.)${prompt}
  13094: (Instead, adventurer, listen to what I have learned...as long as you can hear me.)${prompt}
  13095: (I have transmogrified into a piece of Yggdrasil, the World Tree.)${prompt}
  13096: (${name-player}, Yggdrasil's powers are dwindling even as we speak...)${prompt}
  13097: (A disturbance has appeared in the heart of Ulbuka. Darkness gushes forth as if from some forbidden spring.)${prompt}
  13098: (It is that very darkness which drains Yggdrasil's strength...)${prompt}
  13099: (And you will be the one to stop the cause of it, ${name-player}.)${prompt}
  13100: (If you do not, and this harrowing force chokes Yggdrasil with its crepuscular grip...)${prompt}
  13101: (All life in Ulbuka will cease to exist as we know it. Of this I am certain.)${prompt}
  13102: ${name-player}, your face... It's so pale.${prompt}
  13103: What did my brother tell you!?${prompt}
  13104: |-
    ${name-player}!
    Speak to me, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  13105: You truly believe I will fall for this ruse? That seed will allow us to communicate with Ygnas as much as holding a tea party for the Blackthorn Coven will assuage their undying rancor.${prompt}
  13106: It is only natural that some of us will harbor doubts about what ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] says. The only way to prove ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] right or wrong is to test it for ourselves.${prompt}
  13107: |-
    ${name-player}, was it?
    Do you mind if we borrow that mystic plant of yours for a bit?${prompt}
  13108: |-
    We've been tricked!
    You can't hear Ygnas's voice at all!${prompt}
  13109: I do find it odd that none of us were able to hear him.${prompt}
  13110: However, I also do not see any reason for ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] to lie to us.${prompt}
  13111: Since when did a pioneer need a reas--${prompt}
  13112: ${name-player}, let me try.${prompt}
  13113: Arciela...${prompt}
  13114: '...I can hear something.${prompt}'
  13115: It's...definitely the voice of my brother.${prompt}
  13116: How hilar...I mean intriguing.${prompt}
  13117: |-
    Yes... I see.
    ...But why, brother?${prompt}
  13118: Arciela, what's your tinder-legged brother-wother saying?${prompt}
  13119: |-
    The same thing as he told ${name-player}.
    “Trouble yourself not with breaking the curse.”${prompt}
  13120: Hmmm.${prompt}
  13121: Why is it only these two can communicate with him?${prompt}
  13122: |-
    How utterly in-in-incomprehensible.
    This administration can't f-f-function properly...without a leader.${prompt}
  13123: I agree wholeheartedly with you, Vortimere.${prompt}
  13124: We must p-p-prioritize...removing the chancellor's curse. That is what's best...for the nation.${prompt}
  13125: But...my brother explicitly told us not to!${prompt}
  13126: |-
    L-l-listen, Arciela.
    You and that pioneer are the only two who...claim they can hear him.${prompt}
  13127: We can't overlook the possibility that...you two might be c-c-conspiring together.${prompt}
  13128: That's preposterous!${prompt}
  13129: I realize that it's unlikely...and maybe I should have ch-ch-chosen my words more carefully.${prompt}
  13130: However, I assume that most everyone here...c-c-concurs with me. Returning Ygnas to his original f-f-form is...our first concern.${prompt}
  13131: I'm sure even you agree...to some extent.${prompt}
  13132: I find it d-d-difficult to believe that...you take issue with...him being human. You don't wish for him to stay a...pile of twigs for the rest of his l-l-life, do you?${prompt}
  13133: Well, no. But...${prompt}
  13134: |-
    That is all I need to hear.
    I know exactly the person...to s-s-solve this problem. All we need to do...is summon her b-b-back from her expedition.${prompt}
  13135: |-
    Expedition?
    Ahhh, the mercil... I really should do something about that loose tongue of mine. At any rate, this should prove to be an interesting turn of events.${prompt}
  13136: |-
    This meeting is adjourned.
    Let us...convene again in a f-f-few days' time.${prompt}
  13137: I take it you are yearning to fly like a proverbial bird, to swoop through the alleyways of Adoulin screeching about your strength and speed?${prompt}
  13138: |-
    Hmmm...
    If my memory serves me, I believe there is a wizened wise man in Jeuno who is well-versed in the ululations steel can conjure.${prompt}
  13139: Perhaps it would behoove you to hoof it on over to the Duchy and pay a visit to him?${prompt}
  13140: Your reputation precedes you. I can tell simply from the aura that swirls violently around your frame that you have achieved quite the degree of success as a rune fencer. It is only a matter of time before Maat takes notice of your finely refined skills.${prompt}
  13141: You need only take one step into the city to have me sense the immense aura you exude, pioneer. Should you remain diligent and devoted, you will surely be able to succeed in succeeding the Order of Orvail as an acclaimed rune fencer...once you pass the examination.${prompt}
  13142: |-
    Interesting, indeed.
    My eye proves as accurate as a panopt's once again.${prompt}
  13143: Let me apologize for wasting your time with my esoteric ramblings.${prompt}
  13144: I was simply lost in reverie about the first time I bore witness to your talents.${prompt}
  13145: 'I assume you remember that fateful day as if it had transpired but moments ago. The experience of you engraving a rune upon your flesh after try number ${number: 0} certainly lingers unspoiled in my mind.${prompt}'
  13146: Never has one so naturally suited to the runic arts appeared before me. You are perhaps the very incarnation of runic energies...or the second coming of Sverdhried himself.${prompt}
  13147: I sensed an uncanny reserve of untapped power bubbling over when I first set eyes upon you, and now I believe you could very well surpass the majority of Orvail's fencers in affinity for the arts.${prompt}
  13148: When faced with adversity, you heeded my call across a ravine of despair, drew upon your inner runic powers, and faltered not. It is little wonder that you have come so far in such a brief period.${prompt}
  13149: That which does not kill you can only make you stronger. The inner battle you fought served to strengthen your resolve, and though it may have been late in the season, your runic skills have blossomed no less vividly than even mine.${prompt}
  13150: |-
    Ah, yes.
    It takes mountains of perseverance to join the century club, since those who do often lack even the smallest iota of talent. I still believed in you, however, and am now rewarded with your presence before me today.${prompt}
  13151: |-
    But enough with the social graces and circumlocutions.
    Allow me to point you in the direction of this conversation's point.${prompt}
  13152: Are you ready to throw caution to the wind, unshackle yourself from the fetters of mediocrity, and soar to higher heights as a rune fencer?${prompt}
  13153: |-
    Soar higher?
    ${selection-lines}
    As high as the sun!
    I'll keep my feet on the ground.
    What...? How?${prompt}
  13154: The Order of Orvail institutes a test of seasoned rune fencers' skills that has remained essentially unchanged for generation upon generation.${prompt}
  13155: Passing it is commonly seen as a rite of passage to becoming fully fledged in the runic arts.${prompt}
  13156: |-
    So, I shall ask again.
    What say you to taking the next step and ascending a step closer to the summit of rune fencerdom?${prompt}
  13157: Many in my situation would throw their hands up in disappointment at your unwillingness to take flight. I, however, have confidence you will change your mind one day. Until then, dear ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13158: Is now the time when you will step up to the challenge, spread your wings, and take flight?${prompt}
  13159: |-
    That is exactly the answer I wanted to hear. It evinces your dauntless nature--a natural trait in rune fencers.
    Even had you answered in the negative previously, the filth of indecision is washed clean with the three simple letters Y-E-S.${prompt}
  13160: |-
    Ahem.
    As a symbol of your lofty intent to undertake the “Trial of Reason,” let us engrave another rune upon your skin!${prompt}
  13161: 'Now that your soul burns with passion and your flesh burns with the insignia placed upon it, pass through the gates of ${zone: 1[2]} and run the gauntlet of your greatest weaknesses.${prompt}'
  13162: Your adversary will be one of the order's finest. Trade blows with them and see if you can blow past them to the next echelon of proficiency in the runic arts.${prompt}
  13163: It will be your knowledge of proclivities and propensities, aversions and antitheses that shall ensure your victory. Use it wisely.${prompt}
  13164: 'I repeat: it would be...unbecoming of a rune fencer if you were to forget the lessons you have learned up until now.${prompt}'
  13165: |-
    You went down in defeat, I see...
    None the matter, as long as you turn this stumbling block into a stepping stone.${prompt}
  13166: As much as I would like to imbue the challenger's rune upon you again, I currently lack the resources to create another.${prompt}
  13167: Doing so requires a special medium, which will take some time to procure.${prompt}
  13168: 'If you simply cannot wait a moment longer, however, you can always expedite the process by providing either ${number: 0} gil, ${number: 1} bayld, or ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  13169: |-
    What will you provide?
    ${selection-lines}
    ${number: 0} gil. (${number: 4} on hand)
    ${number: 1} bayld. (${number: 5} on hand)
    ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.
    Nothing. I'll wait.${prompt}
  13170: |-
    Truly donate ${number: 0} gil?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  13171: |-
    Truly donate ${number: 0} bayld?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  13172: |-
    Well, patience is a virtue, they say.
    If you have no need to hurry, come by in a few days' time and you may very well find my preparations to be finished.${prompt}
  13173: |-
    A bold decision, indeed.
    For ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}, I shall be able to engrave another rune upon you.${prompt}
  13174: |-
    Thank you for your generous donation of ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.
    Is currency not a wonderful invention? An abstract yet concrete metaphor for an exchange of services.${prompt}
  13175: |-
    Thank you for your kind donation.
    With this, I shall be able to defer the costs of the engraving ritual.${prompt}
  13176: True rune fencers are honest and adhere to a code of chivalry, but you...you disappoint me, trying to extract services from someone without conferring the appropriate funds in return.${prompt}
  13177: |-
    And so you have returned, no doubt from adventures extraordinary.
    Taking into account that my preparations are complete, I deduce that your friendly gesture may have an ulterior motive...${prompt}
  13178: Wish you to prove your worth against that maiden once more?${prompt}
  13179: |-
    Oh, my.
    Could it be that you wish to clash swords with Miss Braga once more?${prompt}
  13180: |-
    Clash swords once more?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  13181: My sincerest apologies, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13182: Then let us begin the engraving ceremony once more.${prompt}
  13183: |-
    The ink is embedded and your will steeled.
    Now all that is left is to tread into the Coliseum so that you may walk over the back of your opponent.${prompt}
  13184: My face lit up with a joy that rivals Altana's maternal glow when news of your victory first alighted upon my ears, ${name-player}! Congratulations.${prompt}
  13185: It sounded like a simply thrilling bout!${prompt}
  13186: I must remind you, however, that the end of your battle with Braga marks only the beginning of your journey with this newfound puissance.${prompt}
  13187: Cast your diligence as a rune fencer into the fray, and I suspect you will be busy for quite some time.${prompt}
  13188: Furthermore, keep in mind that you have earned the favor of Sverdhried's progeny and been deemed worthy of climbing higher upon the craggy precipice towards runic mastery.${prompt}
  13189: Turn not your back upon the opportunities you have been given, lest the tables turn and you find yourself forsaken and wandering aimlessly.${prompt}
  13190: Respect the runes, though, and you shall never walk alone.
  13191: |-
    Utterly astonishing...
    I am positively atingle with excitement at ${name-player} for having etched the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} upon ${choice-player-gender}[himself/herself].${prompt}
  13192: |-
    Still, that battle...
    History is bound to repeat itself...or should I say re-dye itself a different shade?${prompt}
  13193: |-
    Oh ho, you were here all along.
    How are your runes doing?
    Are they singing the songs you thought they would, or spelling the writing on the wall?${prompt}
  13194: Ah, your arrival is indeed opportune. There is a certain problem which has consumed so much of my time, it has practically given me a bout of consumption.${prompt}
  13195: Our order wishes to forge a blade of legendary status to display at the upcoming celebration of Orvail's grandeur. It must be strong enough to forge dynasties and durable enough to outlast them. Nothing less will bring honor to our glorious rune-bound brotherhood.${prompt}
  13196: To my most earnest regret, however, my hands are most full with new recruits. Loath am I to neglect our order's future for the sake of its present. Therefore, would you be so kind as to assist in crafting this symbol of Orvail's mastery over the runes?${prompt}
  13197: |-
    Help craft the blade?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I'd love to!
    No, this is beneath me.${prompt}
  13198: It saddens me to hear those words from someone so accomplished as you, ${name-player}. I cannot enforce my will upon you, however. Pay me a visit should your stance on the matter shift.${prompt}
  13199: Has the tide of cooperation risen high with prospect and brought you to the shores of our cause, or does it still recede into the depths of yonder endeavors?${prompt}
  13200: |-
    Your aid is much appreciated.
    Firstly, we need to employ the steady and sturdy hand of a veteran blacksmith. One whose spirit burns as fierce as the flames of his forge.${prompt}
  13201: |-
    I will let him know of your visit at some point.
    Now, excuse me while I attend to refining the skills of those with rawer talents than yours.${prompt}
  13202: I require that you seek out an accomplished smith who can fold steel with as little effort as an innkeep folds fresh linens.${prompt}
  13203: |-
    I see...
    Our order is a tall one, indeed. Taller at least than the blacksmith with whom you negotiated.${prompt}
  13204: |-
    Still, to refuse one who is engraved with the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}...
    What a character, that Yestin-Ovestin.${prompt}
  13205: Ah, but what of Jerra?${prompt}
  13206: That Tarutaru's temper may glow hotter than the swords he tempers, but his disciple, Jerra, is much more receptive to...well, anyone and everything.${prompt}
  13207: 'You should be able to unearth her in the Civic Arboretum inside the ${unknown: 0x01053782828280}. Simply sniff for a Mithra drenched in the scent of tomatoes.${prompt}'
  13208: Though his disposition is often said to be suspect, none can doubt Yestin-Ovestin's skill with the hammer and anvil. That blade should be as sharp as my wit in no time at all.${prompt}
  13209: Oh, how I have eagerly awaited your arrival, ${name-player}. I received this most momentous of swords but not a moment ago.${prompt}
  13210: Speaking of which, 'tis high time I tore down the fence of secrecy surrounding rune fencer blades.${prompt}
  13211: Sverdhried, the grandfather of the runic arts, was gracious enough to grace Adoulinian smiths with the method by which he fashioned his personal sword.${prompt}
  13212: Not simply the blade itself, mind you, but instructions on how to create it. Know you not what this implies?${prompt}
  13213: The runes we employ are inscribed both upon and within ourselves. Such is why they resonate with our very emotions and cogitations.${prompt}
  13214: The same can be said of a runeist's relationship with his blade. The deeper the emotional bond between the two, the faster his runes will adjust to the sword's presence and the stronger they will resonate with each other.${prompt}
  13215: You have wandered far and wide to obtain everything necessary to create this metallic magnum opus, and even forged your own friendship with a forge stoker.${prompt}
  13216: Your experiences, the passion of its creator, and the emotional ties between you were all molded into the resilient and acuate shape you see before you.${prompt}
  13217: Therefore, while this was crafted for the sake of Orvail and rune fencers everywhere, there is no one more fitting in Vana'diel to wield this blade than you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13218: 'And the name of your new companion--the symbol of all you have sacrificed for this order--is...the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  13219: Take command of this shining example of defensive excellence and offensive might. The sky is truly the limit once you master the intricacies of this blade.${prompt}
  13220: |-
    Whatever will I do for the ceremony?
    No need to brood upon such banalities, ${choice-player-gender}[son/daughter] of the runeist flock.${prompt}
  13221: I entreated my personal smith to fashion one for me while you were engrossed in your duties.${prompt}
  13222: |-
    Your destination as a fencer was predestined long before you trod upon this continent.
    Focus on reaching it, and let me handle the particulars.${prompt}
  13223: |-
    ${name-player}!
    A rival of yours has arrived saying he desires to combat you.${prompt}
  13224: |-
    Ohohoho, did my jape give you a start?
    The true reason I am happy to see you is that rumors abound regarding some cryptic apparatuses scattered throughout the Middle Lands that harbor runic powers.${prompt}
  13225: I remain highly skeptical of these tales, but they do pique my interest as a rune fencer.${prompt}
  13226: Therefore, I would greatly appreciate your cooperation in investigating these contrivances. What say you, ${choice-player-gender}[good sir/fair lady]?${prompt}
  13227: |-
    What say you?
    ${selection-lines}
    Middle Lands, ho!
    You can survey me walking away.
    Cryptic apparatuses?${prompt}
  13228: A response more frigid than a Gelus rune, but not entirely unwarranted. I shall wait for your heart to warm to my request rather than fanning the fire with a witty retort.${prompt}
  13229: There is scarcely a thing known about them, which stands to reason if they are cryptic, but I shall divulge what I can.${prompt}
  13230: They are said to be hidden within the walls of certain caverns and structures in the Middle Lands.${prompt}
  13231: These devices remain shrouded in mysteries thicker than the veil of any bereaved widow. Surveying them may separate you from your loved ones eternally, but rest assured that your death would be for the good of the runic arts.${prompt}
  13232: So, will you cave in and survey caverns, ruins, and other structures all over the Middle Lands in search of those cryptic contraptions?${prompt}
  13233: How I have waited upon bended knee for those words.${prompt}
  13234: The winds of adventure shall carry you across the Sarutabaruta steppes to the Federation of Windurst. Once there, pay a visit to Ohruru.${prompt}
  13235: Her idiosyncratic speech patterns belie the fact that her knowledge is as vast as the skies and her intellect as bright as the sun on a sweltering summer day. Though she may seem a tad peculiar, she is more than worthy of your trust.${prompt}
  13236: Show that woman of letters this letter and you will be on your way to inscribing your own tales.${prompt}
  13237: I just received a correspondence from Ohruru debriefing me on your investigation. Congratulations!${prompt}
  13238: As thanks for your generosity and high-mindedness in undertaking this mission for us, I have commissioned Yestin-Ovestin to craft some high-class armor for you!${prompt}
  13239: I specifically told him to forge something that would draw out the powers of any runes you had inscribed upon yourself, so its efficacy is assured.${prompt}
  13240: I believe he is almost finished hammering out the particulars. Perhaps you should call upon him as soon as you have the time.${prompt}
  13241: |-
    ...Oh?
    What is this I spy? A rune stone?${prompt}
  13242: |-
    What!?
    Sverdhried's voice can be heard from within those cryptic contraptions?${prompt}
  13243: |-
    ...Interesting, indeed.

    By Altana almighty!
    So that is the form that rune stones take when forged into equipment!${prompt}

    No.${prompt}
  13253: My apologies, ${name-player}. I was unaware that you simply wanted to flaunt in front of another rune fencer.${prompt}

    Thank you! <Sniff>
    I hope my tears of gratitude have an outlet to the Senroh Sea lest they cause a flood. Oh, and do not hesitate to provide more equipment if you have any.${prompt}

  13256: 'That ${item-singular: 0[2]} looks positively splendid on you, ${name-player}. May it serve you well in battle.${prompt}'
  13257: Your path has been long and hard, just as I warned you so long ago that it would be. Yet, look how far you have come in spite of it all.${prompt}

  13259: '...Or it would be if there was not a certain setback set before us.${prompt}'
  13260: We have not held the ultimate trial for rune fencers ever since that fateful accident two years ago.${prompt}
  13261: As you can imagine, I have a favor to ask of you regarding this.${prompt}
  13262: I am fully aware of my impertinence, but this requires skill that only someone of your caliber and experience possesses.${prompt}
  13263: Would you please get to the bottom of why the trial went bottom-up?${prompt}

    Take on the task?
    ${selection-lines}
    It would be my pleasure.
    No, do your own work.${prompt}
  13265: Your reply is a caustic verbal venom I completely expected, yet I have no retort for it. I cannot argue with infallible logic, so will instead fall back on apology. Please forgive my brashness.${prompt}

    Thank you ever so much.
    I hope that, one of these days, I can salvage what little remains of your shipwrecked image of me.${prompt}
  13268: Before you begin your fact-finding mission, however, I must impart upon you this object of apodictic import.${prompt}
  13269: 'It is ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, a picturesque device that can both record pictures on and project them from rune stones.${prompt}'
  13270: This is the same type of contraption a researcher from the Inventors' Coalition used to record the events of that trial two years prior.${prompt}
  13271: By all accounts, it was still accounted for somewhere in the Inventors' Coalition. I need you to review their footage and judge whether or not the current trial is appropriate for rune fencers to undertake.${prompt}
  13272: Speak to Gaddiux, who has been instructed to divulge all the necessary information.${prompt}
  13273: 'Simply inquire about ${item-plural: 1[2]}. He will understand what you mean.${prompt}'

    What did you discover?
    ${selection-lines}
    Someone went missing.
    There's a monster in ${zone: 1[2]}.${prompt}
  13278: |-
    It is as you say.
    A researcher did indeed go missing after the incident.${prompt}
  13279: Her name was Mikolulu...and she was accompanying her younger brother on the ultimate trial.${prompt}
  13280: The only clues to her whereabouts we could obtain were the severed tip of her broadsword and patches of chainmail.${prompt}
  13281: |-
    I fear that she... <Gulp>
    Even now, those words are too painful to speak aloud.${prompt}
  13282: Not even the most clandestine of facts escapes you.${prompt}
  13283: 'Though I have never forayed into ${zone: 1[2]}, I could never forget about the abomination that fouls the waters there.${prompt}'
  13284: Many of the surveyors who ventured into the Ulbukan jungle were devoured by it. The beast gained such an abhorrent reputation that soon it became known as “Insidio.”${prompt}
  13285: The city assembled a band of its finest warriors to dispatch Insidio, and they returned seemingly victorious. However, it quickly returned as if nothing had ever transpired. Perhaps it only left to spawn or somesuch and our extermination plan never truly succeeded at all.${prompt}
  13286: It is not a far-fetched assumption to make, considering the cunning Insidio displays in battle. Its most fearsome trick is to turn opponents' allies into enemies by manipulating their minds.${prompt}
  13287: While I would rather avoid entangling you in this affair, my hands are tied at the moment and I am left with no other recourse.${prompt}
  13288: 'Would you please make for ${zone: 1[2]} and rid it of Insidio? Do this for the good of the city, for the colonization initiative...${prompt}'
  13289: |-
    And for me.
    I have lost scores of friends and fellow countrymen to that fish's lure and wish to see someone finally reel in that atrocity once and for all.${prompt}
  13290: |-
    Oh...oh my!
    That is...${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, is it not!?${prompt}
  13291: The finite nature of our language definitely does not allow me to adequately express the extent of my gratitude, but I hope the following will suffice.${prompt}
  13292: On behalf of Insidio's victims and all those who have suffered in its wake, thank you.${prompt}
  13293: You have proved a tremendous help in regards to the ultimate trial as well.${prompt}
  13294: Is there anything you would like to say about it?${prompt}
  13295: |-
    What about the ultimate trial?
    ${selection-lines}
    The area's too dangerous.
    It needs more hints.
    Make clear what the rewards are.
    Prioritize safety.
    It lacks impact.
    Where's the love?
    It's completely useless.
    I have nothing to say.${prompt}
  13296: As a member of the Order of Orvail, it would pain me to see your advice come to no avail, but I do not foresee the trial going away anytime soon. Your opinion, however, is much appreciated.${prompt}
  13297: |-
    Your words give me wings. Thank you for the vote of confidence.
    ...Or is this a case of “If you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all”?${prompt}
  13298: Hmmm...your criticism certainly has merit. I promise to take it into consideration when revising this most critical of trials.${prompt}
  13299: Now that you have metaphorically scratched my back, it is time that I scratched yours.${prompt}
  13300: 'Here it is, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}...given to rune fencers who have gone above and beyond the call of duty.${prompt}'
  13301: This particular piece of equipment was woven by the most polished artisan known to Ulbuka, so wear it with pride.${prompt}
  13302: I wonder how that Tarutaru's face would look if he had completed the trial two years ago and I was able to give him this as I just have to you...${prompt}
  13303: To you, who have transcended the ranks of common rune fencers and amassed vaults of memories along the way, may your smile always beam with the power of the runes and your blade cut the air with the precision of the most proficient calligrapher.${prompt}

    Sure can.
    Uh...no?${prompt}
  13396: My instincts are never wrong. It's a blessing from Altana herself.${prompt}
  13397: Your tongue is as black as the umbrils that blight this land.${prompt}
  13398: As an exorcist of the highest caliber, recognizing those whose talents may be of use comes as second nature.${prompt}
  13399: You are certainly aware of how I visited the Middle Lands for a time. Even the most reclusive shut-in knows that.${prompt}
  13400: My travels took me to the institute, where they correctly asked me to be a participant in the initiative.${prompt}
  13401: All Adoulin expects me to serve as their face in a foreign land. It would be uncouth of me to refuse such an opportunity.${prompt}

    And look who's come to sprinkle rock salt in my wounds.

    Do you remember Hildebert?
    ${selection-lines}
    Hildewho?
    Oh, yeah, the old guy.

  13432: The head of the Order of Weatherspoon, always wearing those same tired white vestments.${prompt}
  13433: Ugh. I'm eminently aware that not all of us have a way with names, but if you're going to barge into the castle and stick your fingers in everyone's pies, you should at least have the decency to answer a simple question!${prompt}

  13435: '${choice: 2}[Then perhaps/I would perhaps be wrong to presume that] you are aware that his wife fell ill due to some strange demon called Balamor''s machinations?${prompt}'

    O-of course!
    Nope.${prompt}
  13437: Oho. Then I'm sure you can also tell me what her name is.${prompt}
  13438: Naturally. Even the most loose-lipped among our order knows better than to start spreading that around.${prompt}
  13439: Far be it from me to sympathize with Hildebert--or anyone, really--when he's fighting with our beloved “princess,” but even I must confess to harboring a bit of pity for his son, Marcellurin.${prompt}
  13440: The blood of generations of exorcists courses through her veins, and she is more susceptible than most to the whims and whimsies of spirits.${prompt}
  13441: She did return to us for a brief while when you purged Hades from the land...${prompt}
  13442: '...But the slumber has taken hold of her once more. The sun has thrice risen since her eyes opened last. Even I must confess concern, not only for her, but for her son, Marcellurin.${prompt}'
  13443: Ingrid, you need not miss any sleep over my mental state.${prompt}
  13444: My duty is to support both my father and the Order of Weatherspoon during times of crisis.${prompt}
  13445: Altana knows that no love has been lost between you and my father over these past few months.${prompt}
  13446: And despite the past, you have spent countless nights working with Arciela for the betterment of us all.${prompt}
  13447: Ah, the ramblings of a madman never cease, do they?${prompt}
  13448: Yet do not think me wholly without heart. I take full responsibility for the chaos within the order.${prompt}
  13449: I had hoped to seek his counsel...but my tongue always gets the better of me.${prompt}
  13450: The curse has taken its toll on many, but my mother has been hit particularly hard. I fear her spirit and body have suffered in equal measure.${prompt}
  13451: “We did exactly as Arciela wanted, and look where that has gotten us.”${prompt}
  13452: 'My father ${choice: 2}[continues to make/had previously made] that assertion, so any struggle of words between you was inevitable.${prompt}'
  13453: His stubbornness is beyond parallel, especially when presented with evidence to the contrary.${prompt}
  13454: And you? Your blithe naivete is rather incomparable as well.${prompt}
  13455: And you, your invective language.${prompt}
  13456: Marcellurin and I grew up together.${prompt}
  13457: Nothing in life is ever easy--least of all our relationship. My mother failed a purgation ritual, losing all that she held dear...and thus Hildebert took me in.${prompt}
  13458: But the distance between us has always been great. Only Marcellurin treated me as true family.${prompt}
  13459: He remained by my side through thick and thin, especially when the tragedy of my mother's passing grew too much to bear.${prompt}
  13460: What would that say about me were I to stand idle while a similar fate threatens to ravage him?${prompt}
  13461: But the blind fool fails to recognize that the possibility is staring him down.${prompt}
  13462: Should the worst strike him unawares, I fear it would crush him beyond repair.${prompt}
  13463: If anyone can predict his reaction, it is me. The boy is blissfully half-witted.${prompt}

    ${selection-lines}
    ...I suppose not.
    ...Oh, I wouldn't say that...${prompt}
  13466: Bah!${prompt}
  13467: What am I thinking, gushing with emotion to the likes of you?${prompt}
  13468: The only one in this city who pays you a lick of attention is Arciela.${prompt}
  13469: But you are not the only one who supports her. I, too, must do my part to unite the city under her banner.${prompt}
  13470: I am due for a meeting with Gratzigg at the Peacekeepers' Coalition before sundown.${prompt}
  13471: Though the rift between Arciela and the orders has been mended, I must advise those who doubted her in the best way to comport themselves going forward.${prompt}
  13472: Gratzigg is but the first of many, and he has bid me visit his manse.${prompt}
  13473: I would be surprisingly unopposed to you joining me there, should you feel it would serve the princess's best interest.${prompt}
  13474: Ingrid has stepped out for a brief meeting with Gratzigg at his manse. Perhaps it would behoove you to seek the two of them.${prompt}
  13475: Lookin' for Ingrid?${prompt}
  13476: She passed by here, sure, but the maester's busy and shooed her away. 'Fraid he'd do the same to you.${prompt}
  13477: Round up everyone you can! I don't care if they're on leave--we need every hand we can get to root out that jungle menace!${prompt}
  13478: I see you've chosen to tag along.${prompt}
  13479: I had hoped to have a fruitful discussion with our “esteemed” friend, but with the way he's ranting and raving I would have better luck playing catch-the-heartwing blindfolded.${prompt}
  13480: <Sigh> I should have expected no less. The disturbances in the jungle keep going from bad to worse, and even I can't bring myself to call down Altana's wrath upon him.${prompt}
  13481: I demand everyone double down on their patrols--and if I see even one crack in Jorius Yett, it'll be your hides!${prompt}
  13482: The maester is even more relentless than usual these days...${prompt}
  13483: I'll say.${prompt}
  13484: You there! Get out there before I strip you of your uniforms and make you run stark naked across Big Bridge!${prompt}
  13485: At least the pig isn't running around blaming Arciela for all this.${prompt}
  13486: Brush up those uniforms, men!${prompt}
  13487: None of what befell the city would've happened if the Peackeepers hadn't failed to uphold our charge!${prompt}
  13488: At least the pig can issue calls to action.${prompt}
  13489: |-
    Ingrid, you insufferable--
    I told you that I don't have time for any of your nonsense until I get things cleared up around here!${prompt}
  13490: Get your keister outta here before I kick it to the streets myself!${prompt}
  13491: '...But some things never change.${prompt}'
  13492: What a worthless mongrel. How can he keep the peace if he cannot even keep his own troops in order?${prompt}
  13493: <Sigh> This “incident” Gratizgg spoke of...I have no choice but to clean it up in his stead.${prompt}
  13494: Someone suspicious traipsing about Yorcia Weald, southwest of the frontier station? Could you picture anything more laughably absurd?${prompt}
  13495: If the perpetrator is not a pioneer, then it stands to reason...${prompt}
  13496: '...that it could be the dread fiend Balamor. Presuming he has not decided to possess Fremilla again.${prompt}'
  13497: Those two-bit goons Gratzigg decided to dress up in armor would stand no chance against one of that caliber. Once again, it falls to me to clean up others' messes.${prompt}
  13498: '...that it could be the dread fiend Balamor. Presuming he has not decided to possess Fremilla again.${prompt}'
  13499: But with Hades gone, what purpose would masquerading around in human form serve?${prompt}
  13500: Hmph. I shall make him spit it out when I grab him.${prompt}
  13501: Perhaps you would like to see this all play out, given your previous run-ins with him. But no, more likely than not you have your hands full bleeding the city's bayld coffers dry. Forget I said anything.${prompt}
  13502: A suspicious individual has been sighted to the southwest of the frontier station in Yorcia Weald.${prompt}
  13503: There's an ergon locus nearby, so perhaps it's someone trying to harvest its power? That's pure speculation, of course, but the populace is bound to fathom the worst when there is little information.${prompt}
  13504: Gratzigg and Ingrid are likely mincing words at the Peacekeepers' Coalition--and the high exorcist is likely in one of her moods.${prompt}
  13505: Ingrid! Did you parley with the enemy to get this...thing!?${prompt}
  13506: That Morimar guy who came to the castle gave this to you? What use could any of us have for a sullied piece of cloth?${prompt}
  13507: Open your eyes, fool. Even you can understand what this means.${prompt}
  13508: '...Impossible!'
  13509: By all that is holy, this seal--it's Jorius's!${prompt}
  13510: Maybe there is some semblance of a brain inside that rock head of yours. Jorius gave these marks to August's soldiers during the founder king's initial foray into the hinterlands.${prompt}
  13511: Lest you think I play you for a fool yet again, take a close look at the handiwork. Such methods have been lost to the annals of time.${prompt}
  13512: How would common trash get a hold of something like this?${prompt}
  13513: '...I believe you, Ingrid. If anyone''d know the details of such wards, it''d be you.${prompt}'
  13514: Although I am quite certain of its authenticity, Hildebert will want to have a look himself.${prompt}
  13515: Of course. But I'd be careful with that prickly bugger--once he's made up his mind, there's no convincing him otherwise.${prompt}
  13516: |-
    Hmph.
    Leave him to me. If I can't make him see that this is for the good of the city, no one can.${prompt}
  13517: Well, well...${prompt}
  13518: It pains me to admit my gratitude, but...thank you. Jorius's relics'll usher in peace to those who have lost their way.${prompt}
  13519: There is something mystical about this mark...something that goes beyond the mere divine.${prompt}
  13520: Although I am quite certain of its authenticity, Hildebert will want to have a look himself.${prompt}
  13521: Ah, yes. Perhaps it'll help bring Hildebert's wife back from her illness.${prompt}
  13522: We can only hope. Though we have won a major victory, peace has not fully returned to our city.${prompt}
  13523: ${name-player}, you may not have expected me to say this, but...thank you.${prompt}
  13524: Arciela would surely like to be apprised of what has transpired.${prompt}
  13525: Morimar's answers only brought on more questions...and Hildebert's wife has yet to make a recovery.${prompt}
  13526: I can sense the day of our next meeting is close.${prompt}
  13527: Why, would you look--it's ${name-player}!
  13528: Have you heard the wonderful news-wews? Faustoise has finally come to!${prompt}
  13529: I've got to give Hildebert some creditaru--he's good for more than just airing his grievances.${prompt}
  13530: |-
    O-oops! I think my inner-winner monologue just slipped out.
    Ta-ta for now!${prompt}
  13531: ${name-player}, did you have something to do with Faustoise's miraculous recovery?${prompt}
  13532: Then perhaps it really was that old curmudgeon after all.${prompt}
  13533: I came to see if that mark of Jorius that the old relic Morimar gave us could be of any use, but evidently I am not needed here.${prompt}
  13534: Truth be told, I am quite relieved...for Marcellurin's sake.${prompt}
  13535: Madam Faustoise?
  13536: Are you sure you feel well enough to take to the streets alone?${prompt}
  13537: Oh, Ingrid!
  13538: My beloved Ingrid...how long has it been? You've gotten so tall...since I last laid these weary eyes on your sparkling blonde hair...${prompt}
  13539: Wh-what!?
  13540: Come! We must return to the depths of Yorcia Weald...where the threads of fate intertwined.${prompt}
  13541: No...it can't be...${prompt}
  13542: ${name-player}!${prompt}
  13543: Where is my wife? No...where's Faustoise!?${prompt}
  13544: Father, your anxiety is misplaced! Mother is surely in no condition to have gone far.${prompt}
  13545: She is not your mother, nor my wife!${prompt}
  13546: Some vile spirit...some thing...has taken over her body!${prompt}
  13547: A vile spirit? But how...?${prompt}
  13548: There is no time for your waffling! We must enlist the aid of the Peacekeepers forthwith!${prompt}
  13549: I...do not understand. Mother headed for Yorcia Weald...and took Ingrid with her?${prompt}
  13550: Why Ingrid?${prompt}
  13551: “Where the threads of fate intertwined.” What would that have to do with Yorcia Weald?${prompt}
  13552: Perhaps...perhaps the spirit taking over my mother is not malicious, but rather the spirit of Ingrid's mother herself.${prompt}
  13553: Alucia's talents as an exorcist were beyond compare, and she had the heart and beauty to match.${prompt}
  13554: A demonic presence residing in a small oak music box used her purity of spirit against her, leading to one of the most tragic tales of modern times.${prompt}
  13555: The force lashed out, draining her of all her affinity for purgation.${prompt}
  13556: It was not some months later that she left her daughter Ingrid behind and wandered out into the forest alone.${prompt}
  13557: Her body was discovered a fortnight later, near a giant tree growing in the northwest of Yorcia Weald.${prompt}
  13558: She could now be trying to guide Ingrid to that very spot.${prompt}
  13559: We must stop her before the calamity is repeated.${prompt}
  13560: Here. This will protect you.${prompt}
  13561: Should you misplace it or otherwise have it wrested from your control, Rigobertine at the manse's entrance will provide you with another.${prompt}
  13562: I shall meet up with you there.${prompt}
  13563: Though we were initially relieved that Madam Faustoise awoke, I hesitate to say that she has made a true recovery.${prompt}
  13564: Marcellurin indicated that he would head to a large tree in the northwestern section of Yorcia Weald.${prompt}

  13568: The prrrincess often ventures out into the jungle when her presence is not required at the castle.${prompt}
  13569: Today is one such day. She mentioned going on a brrrief foray into Ceizak Battlegrounds.${prompt}

  13751: Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.${prompt}
  13752: Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.${prompt}
  13753: “Unity” is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.${prompt}
  13754: Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.${prompt}
  13755: 'Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as “${keyitem-plural: 1[2]}.”${prompt}'
  13756: Chat settings may be changed by selecting “Status” from the main menu, and choosing “Unity Info” under the “Unity” submenu.${prompt}
  13757: You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.${prompt}
  13758: Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.${prompt}
  13759: The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.${prompt}
  13760: Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).${prompt}
  13761: Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.${prompt}
  13762: “Wanted” objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13763: These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as “Unity accolades” to undertake.${prompt}
  13764: Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.${prompt}
  13765: Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.${prompt}
  13766: The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.${prompt}
  13767: A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.${prompt}
  13768: Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.${prompt}
  13769: Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.${prompt}
  13770: When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.${prompt}
  13771: Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  13772: No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.${prompt}
  13773: You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.${prompt}
  13774: An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.${prompt}
  13775: One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.${prompt}
  13776: A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.${prompt}
  13777: Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  13778: These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.${prompt}
  13779: Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.${prompt}
  13780: You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.${prompt}
  13781: This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.${prompt}
  13782: This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.${prompt}
  13783: However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.${prompt}
  13784: Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.${prompt}
  13785: The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.${prompt}
  13786: Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.${prompt}
  13787: Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.${prompt}
  13788: On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.${prompt}
  13789: 'Additionally, an individual''s evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by ${number: 0}. A Unity''s ranking is the average of all eligible members'' individual evaluations.${prompt}'
  13790: The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.${prompt}
  13791: Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.${prompt}
  13792: 'Those with evaluations of ${number: 0} or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.${prompt}'
  13793: Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.${prompt}
  13794: A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.${prompt}
  13795: Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.${prompt}
  13796: A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.${prompt}
  13797: It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.${prompt}
  13798: Those desiring to participate should seek out one of the initiative's representatives, dressed in green, in one of the three nations.${prompt}
  13799: '${color-alt: 138}You are currently under Unity restriction. Please try again during the next tabulation period.'
  13800: '${color-alt: 138}The A.M.A.N. has removed the Unity restrictions placed on you. Please choose your Unity.'

    The wounds we suffered from what he did here may never heal.${prompt}
  13818: I know this is a bit presumptuous of me to ask, but would you accompany me to Rala Waterways?${prompt}
