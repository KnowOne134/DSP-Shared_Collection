  10816: If all five generals should fall in battle, the Hall of Binding will open, and the beastmen will be able to seize the Astral Candescence.${prompt}
  10817: It is your responsibility to prevent such a disaster from happening. We are depending on you!${prompt}
  10818: When the Astral Candescence is safely resting on its plinth in the Hall of Binding, it emanates waves that bestow special bonuses to Sanction.${prompt}
  10819: The first bonus is a slight boost to the amount of experience points received from battles. You will receive this effect simply by having Sanction cast on you.${prompt}
  10820: There are several other bonus effects, but you must sacrifice some of your Imperial Standing credits in order to receive them.${prompt}
  10821: Keep in mind that the bonuses become more powerful with the number of times the Imperial capital is successfully defended.${prompt}
  10822: Sanction's strength will reset if the beastmen succeed in invading the Hall of Binding, though.${prompt}
  10823: The waves emanating from the Astral Candescence in Al Zahbi bring a multitude of blessings to all of us. You must not let it fall into the hands of the beastmen!${prompt}
  10824: If the beastmen manage to take the Astral Candescence, its recovery will become our top priority. Find the coveted item on a plinth in one of the beastman strongholds and seize it back for the Empire!${prompt}
  10825: We aren't quite sure what the beastmen are scheming to do with such power, but we do know that the Astral Candescence's waves can increase the beastmen's strength.${prompt}
  10826: As if that weren't enough, we have recent reports that the beastmen have set “archaic mirrors” in their strongholds to magnify the power of the waves.${prompt}
  10827: 'If you should come across any archaic mirrors, take them immediately and ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} them to an Imperial guard.${prompt}'

    I'm so, so sorry for stealing your automaton!

  10948: Uhhh...${prompt}
  10949: Why'd you steal my automaton in the first place?${prompt}
  10950: It's a long story...${prompt}
  10951: It all started about half a year ago. I ran an armor shop in Al Zahbi. One day, the sky was pouring down rain and there was hardly anybody on the streets... Business was slow...${prompt}
  10952: And then, a tiny Mithran child visited my shop and asked if I was selling any automatons.${prompt}
  10953: Of course, being an armory, I didn't have a single automaton in stock. But she went all that way in the rain just to come to my shop... I felt terrible turning her away empty handed...${prompt}
  10954: Then, after defeating the dragon... I ran back to the girl, eager to make her dream of becoming a puppetmaster come true.${prompt}
  10955: I couldn't have known what tragedy awaited...${prompt}
  10956: A terrible tragedy...
  10957: Geez, you weren't kidding when you said this was gonna be long.${prompt}
  10958: Oh, come on. I'm a third of the way through already! Won't you let me continue?${prompt}
  10959: I want to go look for my automaton. I think the place you were at was a fine ending to your story.${prompt}
  10960: You will take that horrible thing back, won't you?${prompt}
  10961: That's what I came here for! But now I don't know where she is...${prompt}
  10962: If it's not on a ship, it must have gone to Caedarva Mire. I'll do anything I can to help you find it!${prompt}
  10963: Thanks. It's your fault we're so far behind now, anyway. You and your pointless story...${prompt}
  10964: Pointless!?${prompt}
  10965: Hopefully ${name-player} will tag along just a little longer, too.${prompt}
  10966: All right, let's go!${prompt}
  10967: Rats!${prompt}

  10972: Yeah, I see...${prompt}
  10973: I called them here to watch an automaton performance.${prompt}
  10974: A performance for...Qiqirn?${prompt}
  10975: That's right. No matter how talented your automaton is, the Qiqirn aren't going to understand the point of its antics.${prompt}
  10976: We'll charge in when it's starting to get desperate, and tell it that its abilities are still limited.${prompt}
  10977: Then the automaton will realize how helpless it is without Iruki-Waraki, and it's sure to go back to him.${prompt}
  10978: But I don't think I could entertain Qiqirn, either...${prompt}
  10979: |-
    That doesn't matter.
    The point is merely to prove to the automaton the limit of its ability.${prompt}
  10980: After it comes to its senses, you'll be there for it... It is certain to accept you then.${prompt}
  10981: You think that all of that will go according to plan? What if she's not even interested in performing for Qiqirn?${prompt}
  10982: |-
    Don't worry.
    The way it was bragging last time, there's no way it'll refuse.${prompt}
  10983: (I hope this is the right way to go about bringing her back...)${prompt}
  10984: |-
    It's here!
    There's no turning back now!${prompt}
  10985: Where the hell were you? I'm gonna use you for kilicbaligi bait, you big oaf!${prompt}
  10986: Iruki-Waraki? What are you doing here? Get it through your head... I'm not going back!${prompt}
  10987: I...${prompt}
  10988: We just wanted to watch you perform. We gathered everyone here together just for you.${prompt}
  10989: What's that? You've gotta be out of your mind!${prompt}
  10990: Well, you said yourself that everyone was looking forward to your performance. You said that you're fine on your own.${prompt}
  10991: I called Iruki-Waraki here so he could see that for himself, and bring him some closure.${prompt}
  10992: Whatever. You're really getting on my nerves. Can I hit you?${prompt}
  10993: Whoa whoa, let's not be rash, now. There's already a crowd here, so isn't it the perfect chance to show us your skill?${prompt}
  10994: There's no crowd! Just you and this runt!${prompt}
  10995: Oh, you know that's not true. Just look around you.${prompt}

  10998: Why, of course I am... Or are Qiqirn a problem for you?${prompt}
  10999: Qiqirn, eh...${prompt}
  11000: After all that talk about how everyone loves your performances, it turns out that you're picky with your audience, eh?${prompt}
  11001: |-
    Ah, I get it now!
    You only perform for the easily entertained! It doesn't take much to please them, right? I see... So that's why!${prompt}
  11002: Pardon me for asking you to perform! To think... I never imagined such a pathetic excuse...${prompt}
  11003: I apologize for the misunderstanding!${prompt}
  11004: You have a death wish, don't you?${prompt}
  11005: |-
    Fine, let's play your game.

  11021: This is hand? How yooo use?${prompt}
  11022: It's no use... Just as I thought...${prompt}
  11023: Yes, this is the limit of your talent. By yourself, you can do nothing... You're just a regular automaton with a big head.${prompt}

  11051: Anybody can tell a puppet to do tricks, but a good puppetmaster grows with his automaton!${prompt}

  11614: Hmph... Worthless.${prompt}
  11615: Ah, finally someone who may be of use.${prompt}
  11616: Might you be one of those self-proclaimed adventurers?${prompt}
  11617: |-
    Excellent...
    Now lend me your ears for a moment, and I shall let you in on a proposition that is sure to benefit the both of us.${prompt}
  11618: To the west of this dreary village lies the infamous Hazhalm Testing Grounds, currently off-limits to all but the Empire's highest-ranking officials.${prompt}
  11619: And why has the research facility been shut down, you ask?${prompt}
  11620: Once, long ago, a tiny “portal” was accidentally opened during one of our experiments.${prompt}
  11621: Oh, nothing drastic occurred, just a few “mice” slipped through the gate before the scientists closed it back up.${prompt}
  11622: However, instead of attempting to solve the insignificant problem that arose, the witless Imperial officials simply sealed off the facilities rather than admit they had done anything wrong.${prompt}
  11623: A travesty to science, if you ask me.${prompt}
  11624: I, personally, was on the verge of deciphering the paradigm of Life, when they forced me from my research. They did not even allow me to gather my notes!${prompt}
  11625: Just one more step... One more step and I would have reached the realm of the gods!${prompt}
  11626: But thanks to the blundering of the Empire's pawns, the realization of Paradise has been thrust back centuries!${prompt}
  11627: And that is why I require your assistance in regaining access to the grounds.${prompt}
  11628: Your job is simple.${prompt}
  11629: You need merely travel to the sealed facilities and rid it of its pest problem.${prompt}
  11630: Now let me explain how you are to go about doing so...${prompt}
  11631: The seal upon Hazhalm is of a powerful magic.${prompt}
  11632: However, through my studies of “mice” retina, I have discovered a type of light that can temporarily reduce the potency of the seal, allowing one to pass beyond it.${prompt}
  11633: 'Using this special ${item-singular: 0[2]} at the gates to the testing grounds will grant you entrance into the facilities.${prompt}'
  11634: 'And the lamp is yours for just a mere ${number: 1} gil.${prompt}'
  11635: You question my motives for this request of remuneration when it is you who will be doing the work?${prompt}
  11636: To question is to learn... You may have the potential to become a fine alchemist.${prompt}
  11637: |-
    But that is not what you wish to know, is it?
    Well, then let me put it simply--what if you were to take this expensive lamp down to the local market and peddle it off to the highest bidder? Just as you question my motives, I am inclined to question yours.${prompt}
  11638: 'And so the fee I require for the lamp can be thought of as insurance: a piece of good mind, you might say.${prompt}'
  11639: Ah yes, but unlike us scientists, striving to help a fellow neighbor out of the goodness of one's heart is not the way of the adventurer, now, is it?${prompt}
  11640: But you need worry not. Do recall I said this endeavor would benefit both of us.${prompt}
  11641: Each of the vermin that scampers about the testing grounds' chambers can be identified by a unique code contained within its blood cells.${prompt}
  11642: Bringing the blood of your victims back here will prove to me that you have eradicated them.${prompt}
  11643: Based on the number of ampoules you bring, I can reward you accordingly.${prompt}
  11644: And no, the compensation I offer in return for your services does not consist of worthless pennies of bronze, silver, or mythril.${prompt}
  11645: I know you adventurers, and I know the treasures you desire. I have collected a fine assortment of items that are most certain to whet the appetite of any seeking something unique. So, have I piqued your interest in my proposal?${prompt}
  11646: What do you require of me?${prompt}
