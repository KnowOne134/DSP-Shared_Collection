  13: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  14: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  15: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  16: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}It is said strange creatures appear at this time of year, granting great fortune to those who receive their blessings.${prompt}'

  24: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The buffalo run rampant once more. Corralling them is certainly a better option than hunting them to extinction.${prompt}'
  25: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The Harvest Festival is a time for mischief, yet it gives me pause; what if some villainous scum were to use the deceit as a weapon?${prompt}'
  26: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Knights making their rounds have reported some odd plants sprouting about the land. Perhaps I best equip them with sickles to cull the weeds before they spread.${prompt}'

  31: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I devour even the most detailed of volumes in a scant three days, and hence scarce have room on my shelves to store so much as another simple document.${prompt}'
  32: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The bells of San d''Oria''s cathedral are so large and wizened that ringing them is said to take five men.${prompt}'
  33: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Sometimes it strikes me--if those who live by the sword die by the sword, is my destiny to fall in battle?${prompt}'
  34: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Although I admit the penmanship of my brother leaves much to be desired, I cannot help but wonder if some use it as an excuse to ignore his proclamations.${prompt}'
  35: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The Brugaire Consortium has been transporting suspicious goods of late. I must bolster the watch around that area.${prompt}'
  36: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Strength alone is insufficient to wrest victory.${prompt}'
  37: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Many tasks fall to the Temple Knights, yet none is more important than ensuring the safety of San d''Oria and her citizens.${prompt}'

  46: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Attention! All able-bodied members should report for battle in ${zone: 2[2]} in the next ${number: 4} minutes. We have reason to believe that ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl] will make his presence known at ${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?].${prompt}'
  47: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Just as our intelligence predicted, ${choice: 4}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl/???] has appeared in ${zone: 2[2]} at ${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?]!${prompt}'

  50: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Strange...our scouts report no trace of ${choice: 4}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl/???] in ${zone: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  51: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I have nothing but admiration for all the blood, sweat, and tears you have put into making my Unity the most prestigious.${prompt}'
  52: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}You can all be proud of the work you have done to get us this ranking. Yet do not let your guard down for a second.${prompt}'

  64: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  65: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  66: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Creatures heralding the new year have been spotted throughout the land.${prompt}'
  67: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}No one could care less about Valentione''s Day than I. I swear.${prompt}'
  68: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The Doll Festival is a perfect time for Kaede and I to renew our sisterly bonds.${prompt}'

  81: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Rather than wait to be taught, you should learn with your own two eyes. Steel yourself and open up your path with your own hands.${prompt}'
  82: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I believe that it is critical to continue training day and night, regardless of how busy you are.${prompt}'
  83: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Though I wish that Kaede not take up the blade, I recognize that the decision is hers to make.${prompt}'
  84: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Deegis should spend less time talking about his bulging muscles and more time improving his wares.${prompt}'
  85: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Perhaps I should make a stop at the Steaming Sheep Restaurant. Kaede always had a soft spot for their baked potatoes.${prompt}'
  86: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Cid''s cannons have gone many a year without needing to fire. We must remain ever vigilant to ensure that this remains the case.${prompt}'

  90: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Stone soup...is really just water, is it not?${prompt}'
  91: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'

  95: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}It seems we have a bit of a problem... Servants of ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl] have appeared in ${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?] in ${zone: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  96: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I have just received word from our scouts that ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl] is expected to arrive in ${zone: 2[2]} in ${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?] within the next ${number: 4} minutes. Let us combine our forces to confront this menace!${prompt}'

  100: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${choice: 4}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl/???] is nowhere to be seen. Our advance party will continue to patrol ${zone: 2[2]} in search of a trail.${prompt}'
  101: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Being first is only one of many steps the lot of you will have to take.${prompt}'
  102: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}What!? We''re not first? Set those objectives, ladies, and be quick about it!${prompt}'
  103: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Bah, you disgust me! You bunch of worms don''t even know how to get a good ranking, do you?${prompt}'
  104: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Last? Last!?${prompt}'

  106: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}All right, which of you worms hasn''t been contributing to our ranking? Was it you? Do you want to be meat for the hounds!?${prompt}'
  107: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Perhaps I did not read the charts correctly. They say our rankings are low... Is my eyesight not what it used to be, hmmmmmmmmm!?${prompt}'
  108: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Last place!? You maggots need to think long and hard about how to get us out of here!${prompt}'
  109: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}We''ll show them all that my Unity is nigh invincible!${prompt}'
  110: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Listen up, bottom feeders! You have ten...no, eight minutes to earn 1,000 accolades!${prompt}'
  111: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Anyone content with our ranking being as dismal as it is should report for a beheading immediately!${prompt}'
  112: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Last place? I wonder if maggots can feast on the flesh of other maggots...${prompt}'
  113: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  114: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  115: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  116: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Less ringing in the new year, more getting back to work!${prompt}'
  117: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Valen-whatever is a time for pigs to roll around in the mud, not for adventurers to be taking a break!${prompt}'
  118: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Suppose these dolls would appreciate having an axe lying next to them?${prompt}'
  119: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The egg hunt is on, but none of you good-for-nothings need waste your time with it!${prompt}'
  120: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Repeat after me--pirates who steal valuable artifacts must be punished!${prompt}'
  121: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Be thankful that the moogles have rewards for your faithful service, because I sure as hell don''t!${prompt}'
  122: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Celestial Nights is a worthless farce. The only night you lot should care about is the night shift!${prompt}'
  123: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Mumor doesn''t need any worthless maggots for fans! Leave the cheering to me and stay focused on your task!${prompt}'
  124: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Ugh. Worthless moogles let the buffalo escape again.${prompt}'
  125: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}And dressing up in frilly Halloween costumes will help us on the field of battle how, exactly? That''s right, it doesn''t!${prompt}'
  126: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}We''re still in the midst of figuring out what in blazes is goin'' down in Bastok Mines, but if any of those plants get out of control, I''m ready to whack ''em down with my axe!${prompt}'
  127: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I don''t care how prettied up the town is this Starlight Celebration--you maggots are maggots through and through!${prompt}'
  128: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Double accolades!? Don''t sit there like tree stumps! Haul tail and work!${prompt}'
  129: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}One of the musketeers has reported sightings of a dragon over in South Gustaberg. Can you picture a better quarry!?${prompt}'
  130: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Reports''ve been flooding in about ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} in the lottery held in ${zone: 2[2]}. Hmph. Who can tell truth from myth these days?${prompt}'
  131: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Have I ever shared with you the story of when I was a centurion? No? Well, listen good. I was pincered between the Royal Knights and a Mithran troop...${prompt}'
  132: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Wanna hear about the time I was a millenturion? Good. I was caught between a horde of Sahagin by sea and Quadav by land...${prompt}'
  133: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Let me share with you the story of when I was a general among generals! I was on a ship run by the most rubbish captain you had ever seen...${prompt}'
  134: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}A strong warrior never fails! No matter how sturdy the sword, it''s utterly worthless if it breaks.${prompt}'

  138: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}A true warrior anticipates his opponent''s next move and is ready to retaliate!${prompt}'
  139: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Ah, there''s nothing quite like the ocean!${prompt}'

  142: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  143: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  144: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}By my count, it looks like we''ve defeated ${number: 3} ${choice-plurality: 3}[monster/monsters] in a row, for a total of ${number: 4} ${choice-plurality: 4}[monster/monsters]. I hope you maggots aren''t satisfied with these results!${prompt}'
  145: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl]''s minions have appeared in grid ${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?] of ${zone: 2[2]}! Dispose of them immediately!${prompt}'
  146: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Reconnaissance just sent this through. Unusual activity''s been reported in ${zone: 2[2]}, grid ${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?]. We think that ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl] will strike there within ${number: 4} minutes. I want you maggots waiting for him when he shows up. Get moving!${prompt}'
  147: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${choice: 4}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl/???] has been identified in ${zone: 2[2]}, grid ${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?]. You and your maggoty friends better get down there now, or I''ll have to call the surgeon to remove my boot from your rear!${prompt}'
  148: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Our objective area is ${zone: 2[2]}. Target is ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl]. Target''s HP is at ${number: 4}%! Maintain your battle lines!${prompt}'

  158: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}We mightaru be last for now, but I know you have it in you.${prompt}'
  159: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}If we continue like this, first place is only a breath-weath away!♪${prompt}'

  244: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Now then, we''ve managed to take out ${number: 3} ${choice-plurality: 3}[monster/monsters] in a row. That means we''ve defeated ${number: 4} ${choice-plurality: 4}[monster/monsters] in total.${prompt}'
  245: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Hmm... A group of ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl]''s lapdogs has appeared at ${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?] in ${zone: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  246: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Hrmph. The Jeuno garrison sent us a request. They say ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl] will show up in ${zone: 2[2]} around ${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?] in the next ${number: 4} minutes or so. What d''you say?${prompt}'

  248: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl] in ${zone: 2[2]}''s at ${number: 4}% HP. Let him have it!${prompt}'

  251: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}First place! Outstanding!${prompt}'
  252: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Not a bad showing this week. Let''s aim for the top in the next tabulation period!${prompt}'
  253: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I suppose it could be worse...but try harder this week!${prompt}'
  254: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Last place!? What''s the point of this Unity?${prompt}'
  255: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}We''re holding strong in first. Stay sharp, everyone!${prompt}'
  256: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Now...how best to raise our ranking even higher?${prompt}'
  257: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I can''t be responsible for what''ll happen if we can''t raise our ranking!${prompt}'
  258: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}This ranking doesn''t look good for us! Get us out of last before the week''s over!${prompt}'
  259: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}We''re in first! Keep on pressing forward!${prompt}'
  260: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}A little bit more and we can be at the top!${prompt}'
  261: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}There''s not much longer until the results are tabulated. C''mon--dig us out of this hole!${prompt}'
  262: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Urk...if we''re last place at this juncture, we could be in trouble!${prompt}'
  263: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  264: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  265: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  266: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I''ll go investigate these New Year''s creatures that have been roaming the land.${prompt}'
  267: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I''m going to make a killing with Valentione''s Day chocolates!${prompt}'
  268: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Sometimes I wonder what the whole deal is with the Doll Festival...${prompt}'
  269: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}What? Another “K” egg!?${prompt}'
  270: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The Feast of Swords is here again. I''ll make sure to be on the lookout.${prompt}'
  271: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}You adventurers should stop by the moogles in the three nations. I hear they''ve got surprises in store for you.${prompt}'
  272: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Celestial Nights are the perfect opportunity to procure mysterious goods from the east. Never miss the chance to make a profit.${prompt}'
  273: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}A stage show? I''m...going to skip that one.${prompt}'
  274: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}You''ve gotta help wrangle those buffalo. Their ranch is a good customer of mine.${prompt}'
  275: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}What do you mean, “Kids don''t like to be given crackers on the Harvest Festival?”?${prompt}'
  276: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}What''s this now? Plants going crazy? Bah, that sounds like an opportunity for profit if I''ve ever heard one!${prompt}'

  279: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I''ve heard word of dragons flying over the three nations. You''ll probably want to go more directly, while I find out more from the shadows.${prompt}'
  280: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} in the ${zone: 2[2]} lottery? Just where do they get their hands on these things!?${prompt}'
  281: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Live for the moment! You never know if it''ll be your last.${prompt}'
  282: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}There is no such thing as luck. The only thing we can rely on is our own ingenuity.${prompt}'
  283: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Breaking down barriers is the starting point for becoming something greater.${prompt}'
  284: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Never slow down--always pressing forward is what got me where I am today.${prompt}'
  285: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Who cares if your self-confidence is misplaced? It''s better than having none at all.${prompt}'
  286: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}What use is it separating good or evil when neither can be physically measured?${prompt}'
  287: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}People are not to be manipulated. They must act of their own free will.${prompt}'
  288: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I''ll not let our future be stolen from us.${prompt}'
  289: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Sister...${prompt}'
  290: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I could go for some spicy tacos...${prompt}'
  291: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  292: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  293: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  294: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Up to now, we''ve defeated ${number: 3} ${choice-plurality: 3}[monster/monsters] in a row. Let me see...that gives us ${number: 4} less ${choice-plurality: 4}[monster/monsters] to worry about.${prompt}'
  295: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Tch! Some of ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl]''s lackeys have appeared! You can find them in ${zone: 2[2]} (${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?]).${prompt}'
  296: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}So here''s the deal. Within the next ${number: 4} minutes, ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl] will be in ${zone: 2[2]} (${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?]). Don''t ask me how I know this, but trust me, my sources never lie.${prompt}'

  298: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl] in ${zone: 2[2]}''s HP is at ${number: 4}%.${prompt}'
  299: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Good work team! ${choice: 4}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl/???] in ${zone: 2[2]} is history!${prompt}'

  301: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Of course we''re first--I''d expect nothing less of my Unity!${prompt}'
  302: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Not a bad showing, comrrrades! Let''s push for first next time!${prompt}'
  303: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I''m surrre we could have done better. Let''s shake this off and aim higher next week!${prompt}'
  304: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Last place... Hah! All the more reason to set the flame in your hearts burrrning!${prompt}'
  305: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Excellent. Maintain this pace and we''ll be first for surrre!${prompt}'
  306: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Close but no cigarrr--but I bet you''ve still got a few tricks up your sleeves!${prompt}'
  307: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}A bit disappointing. Redouble your efforrrts!${prompt}'
  308: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Last? If we don''t do something quick, we''ll be bottom feederrrs!${prompt}'
  309: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}We''re in firrrst--only a little bit to go!${prompt}'
  310: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}A tad more effort and we can pluck first from the clutches of our rrrivals!${prompt}'
  311: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I''ll give you a little bit of leeway--just strrrike for first!${prompt}'
  312: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}My Unity...last? How?${prompt}'
  313: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  314: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  315: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'

  317: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Valentione''s Day, huh? Our kukuru beans are just flying off the shelves!${prompt}'
  318: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Is it true that the cherry trrrees are in bloom during the Doll Festival?${prompt}'
  319: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I''ve never understood the strrrange custom of exchanging lettered eggs.${prompt}'
  320: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}A Mithrrra is in charge of those dastardly pirates? I''ll bet her skill with a blade is unparalleled!${prompt}'
  321: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}My understanding is that adventurrrers should be heading to their homelands right about now--the moogles have prepared some special gifts!${prompt}'
  322: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Celestial Nights already? I know what I''ll wish for--the safety of Kazham!${prompt}'
  323: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}A fighting idol and her motley crew, huh? Times surrre have changed since I was last on the mainland.${prompt}'
  324: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Buffalo gone wild? The lot of you should be able to handle it!${prompt}'
  325: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Mithra can sniff out who someone is, so Halloween costumes aren''t nearly as popularrr over here.${prompt}'
  326: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Fascinating. All manner of strrrange plants running around the mainland.${prompt}'
  327: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Merry Starrrlight! Even someone like me has her weak moments and makes a wish or two.${prompt}'
  328: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Double accolades!? If you don''t get some now, then when?${prompt}'
  329: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I chanced upon an odd tome detailing the flight of drrragons. Could it be related to the shadows floating over the mainland?${prompt}'
  330: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The ${zone: 2[2]} lottery has delivered ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} as its newest result. Not that I carrre.${prompt}'
  331: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The young ones these days are into trrrinkets from the mainland. Their buzzing and caterwauling drive me to distraction!${prompt}'
  332: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}My most prized treasure has always been this trrrusty dagger of mine. It reminds me so much of my mother.${prompt}'
  333: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}To live is to fight.${prompt}'
  334: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Thinking about your prrroblems won''t solve them. You have to act!${prompt}'
  335: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The key to any victory is concentrrration. Don''t look into the enemy''s eyes--trust your instincts.${prompt}'
  336: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I considerrr all the Mithra in Kazham to be my daughters.${prompt}'
  337: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The true secret of a seasoned warrrior is not that she fights for victory, but that she gives her all.${prompt}'
  338: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I can barely face the Bastore Sea. If things were but a little different, then I...${prompt}'
  339: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Gilgamesh...${prompt}'

  345: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I hear that a grrroup of ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl]''s minions is waiting in ${zone: 2[2]} (${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?]). Looks like a prelude to the main battle.${prompt}'
  346: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}One of our young seers says she senses the growing prrresence of ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl] in ${zone: 2[2]} around ${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?]. She said sometime in the next “${number: 4} minutes...”${prompt}'
  347: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}It''s ${choice: 4}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl/???]! He''s appearrred in ${zone: 2[2]} around ${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?]. Help us brrring the fight to him!${prompt}'
  348: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Keep the prrressure on ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl] in ${zone: 2[2]}! He''s at ${number: 4}% HP!${prompt}'
  349: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${choice: 4}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl/???] in ${zone: 2[2]} is no more! You kittens arrren''t so weak after all!${prompt}'
  350: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}You Opo-opo-headed numbskulls! ${choice: 4}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl/???] in ${zone: 2[2]}''s gotten away!${prompt}'

  354: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Last place!? Impossible! Abquhbah! Get your lazy butt over here and make surrre the other Unities didn''t do any funny business!${prompt}'
  355: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Haha! We''re leaving our competition in the dust!${prompt}'
  356: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Stop sitting around like bumps on a log and grrrab first place!${prompt}'
  357: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}At this rate, first place is a drrream within a dream! No more mucking about--get out there and work for it!${prompt}'
  358: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Abquhbah!!! You''ve got exactly forty seconds to work out why we''re in last place!${prompt}'

  360: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}We''re not first, and there''s only a little bit of time left! If ya don''t want your hands to be chopped off, then stop being useless and get more accolades!${prompt}'
  361: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}My Unity...what happened to it? Look at our pitiful showing!${prompt}'
  362: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Abquhbah!!! It''s a ten percent pay cut if we don''t come in first!${prompt}'

  369: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Egg hunt, hmmm? Maybe if I boiled some eggs and scrrribbled letters on... Nah, it''d never work.${prompt}'
  370: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The trrreasures of the Feast of Swords are something I''d like to lay eyes on even once.${prompt}'
  371: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The moogles are in the Middle Lands waiting to hand out prrrizes. I''ll bet they''ve got something for ya, too.${prompt}'
  372: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Perhaps we can devise some Celestial Nights tours to Aht Urhgan...maybe?${prompt}'
  373: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Mumor''s Heroine Stage Show is supported in part by Salaheem''s Sentinels. Make sure to participate and sprrread the word about all the good work we do!${prompt}'

  382: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}There''s no prrroblem too big or small for Salaheem''s Sentinels!${prompt}'
  383: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Salaheem''s Sentinels Rule No. 1: Neverrr say “it can''t be done”!${prompt}'

  388: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Your job is to turn a 70% chance of victorrry into 100%!${prompt}'
  389: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Perhaps some of my Unity members have grrraduated from my academy?${prompt}'
  390: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Now wherrre do you suppose I can find the best tuna...?${prompt}'
  391: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  392: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  393: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  394: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Haha! That''s the spirrrit! We''ve beaten ${number: 3} ${choice-plurality: 3}[monster/monsters] in a row, giving us a grand total of ${number: 4} ${choice-plurality: 4}[monster/monsters] defeated! Abquhbah!${prompt}'
  395: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}There''s a grrroup of ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl]''s minions that''ve arrived in ${zone: 2[2]} near ${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?]. Get out there and do whatcha do best!${prompt}'
  396: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Listen up! A very rrreliable source tells me ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl] will be showing up in ${zone: 2[2]} around ${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?] in the next ${number: 4} minutes or so. Get ready to head out there if ya want your cut of the profits!${prompt}'
  397: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}What did I tell you? ${choice: 4}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl/???]''s been spotted in ${zone: 2[2]} around ${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?]. Do you need me to hold your paws, or can ya figure out the rest by yourselves?${prompt}'
  398: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/] in ${zone: 2[2]}''s at ${number: 4}% HP! Remember, if ya don''t bring me back his head I can still settle for yourrrs!${prompt}'
  399: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}And that, my frrriends, is how we do it. ${choice: 4}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl/???] in ${zone: 2[2]} is cat food.${prompt}'
  400: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Okay, now who wants to explain to me how ${choice: 4}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl/???] in ${zone: 2[2]} got away? I prrromise I won''t bite...don''t know what my morgenstern might do, though...${prompt}'
  401: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}First place! Fabulous!${prompt}'
  402: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}A decent showing! Keep smiling and aim for the stars!${prompt}'
  403: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Perhaps we would have stood out a bit more if we were last...${prompt}'
  404: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Last place...at the very least we can use this in the coalition''s next show.${prompt}'
  405: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Oh, my! First place is splendid! Good work--but don''t get too tuckered out.${prompt}'
  406: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Personally, I''d be happiest if we were at the pinnacle of excellence or down in the dumps.${prompt}'
  407: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I suppose I''d best give you a pep talk as the Unity leader--right now our ranking is pretty scummy.${prompt}'
  408: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}We''re number last! We''re number last!${prompt}'
  409: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}We''re in first? I initially thought this Unity was a farce--but you''ve really done it!${prompt}'
  410: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}It''s almost the tabulation period. We''ve got a decent position, but don''t overdo it!${prompt}'
  411: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Take a little break, everyone. There''s only one place to aim for now--the bottom!${prompt}'
  412: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Go team! Or rather, don''t go team!${prompt}'
  413: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  414: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  415: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  416: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The Mummers'' Coalition is quite interested in these New Year''s creatures popping up in the Middle Lands.${prompt}'
  417: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Come stop by my coalition sometime--we''ve got some delicious frontier chocolate!${prompt}'
  418: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}A Doll Festival? That sounds like the perfect concept to import into Adoulin!${prompt}'
  419: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I know the egg hunt game is popular where you''re from, but my coalition''s games are just as exciting!${prompt}'
  420: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I''ve always been curious about the Far East. Perhaps the Feast of Swords is the perfect opportunity to learn more.${prompt}'
  421: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The moogles in your home nations have prepared presents for you--or so I''ve heard.${prompt}'
  422: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I''ve heard of Celestial Nights--something about a man and woman playing catch, right?${prompt}'
  423: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The Mummers'' Coalition is a huge supporter of Mumor''s show. Sometimes I wonder--would it kill her to show a little more leg?${prompt}'
  424: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I heard some buffalo have escaped and are running rampant. Hmmm...if the Watergarden Coliseum can have raptor fights, then why not buffalo fights?${prompt}'
  425: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}This Halloween tradition in the Middle Lands is really quite similar to a dress-up festival we have in Adoulin.${prompt}'
  426: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Oho, plants running wild in the Middle Lands! Sounds like a time to unleash my raptors on--.........<transmission cuts out>${prompt}'
  427: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Merry Starlight! Our coalition staff has dressed up extra special in celebration of the season.${prompt}'
  428: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Did you hear that you can earn double accolades if you act now?${prompt}'
  429: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I''ve heard that you''re dealing with a dragon issue over in the Middle Lands. You suppose I''d be able to parley with them?${prompt}'
  430: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Amazing! ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} was drawn in the lottery held in ${zone: 2[2]}!${prompt}'
  431: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Some fuddy-duddies think of the Mummers'' Coalition as a den of iniquity, when in reality we provide entertainment services that let people forget about their troubles.${prompt}'
  432: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The most important step in learning how to play a game is figuring out how not to lose.${prompt}'
  433: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Critics of our raptor fights fail to realize that we have the creatures'' permission.${prompt}'
  434: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The tougher things get, the more important it is to sing, dance, and laugh.${prompt}'
  435: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}If you think it''s wisest to run, then run! Too many of the other Unity leaders have their heads stuck up where the sun doesn''t shine.${prompt}'
  436: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The other orders can be a bit stifling...but don''t tell Svenja I said that.${prompt}'
  437: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Many years back, someone from the Order of Thurandaut visited the Middle Lands. Have you heard the story?${prompt}'
  438: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}You can see pretty versions of history in Celennia Memorial Library, but I certainly don''t want to go out with a smile on my face.${prompt}'
  439: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I''ve got...I''ve got the vapors!${prompt}'
  440: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The only true justice in this world is the feeling of relief you get once your ice cream headache has passed.${prompt}'
  441: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  442: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  443: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  444: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Haha! Splendid! We''ve beaten ${number: 3} ${choice-plurality: 3}[monster/monsters] in a row, bringing our total to ${number: 4} ${choice-plurality: 4}[monster/monsters] defeated!${prompt}'
  445: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Alright then, it seems a group of ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl]''s minions is looking to set the stage at ${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?] in ${zone: 2[2]}. Go introduce yourself!${prompt}'
  446: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}You there! Do you like ${zone: 2[2]}? Do you like ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl]? That''s good! According to one of our feelers, sometime in the next ${number: 4} minutes, he should show up there around ${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?].${prompt}'
  447: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}What do you know? It''s ${choice: 4}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl/???] and he''s at ${zone: 2[2]} (${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?]). We should totally kill him!♪${prompt}'
  448: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}This just in! ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl] in ${zone: 2[2]} is at ${number: 4}% HP!${prompt}'
  449: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}You did it! The evil ${choice: 4}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl/???] is beat, ${zone: 2[2]} is at peace, the princess is saved, a hero is you, etc.${prompt}'
  450: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Uh-oh. The ${choice: 4}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl/???] that was in ${zone: 2[2]} is not there anymore. Has anyone seen him? If any of you see him, please let us know.${prompt}'
  451: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Getting to first place-ethy was the fruit of our combined efforts, but I think you''ll all agree that it was the only logical outcome.${prompt}'
  452: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}A rather humdrum result-ethy, but not altogether unexpected.${prompt}'
  453: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}<Sigh> The latest ranking data wouldn''t be so disappointing-ethy had we better augmented our activities.${prompt}'
  454: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Yes, I know we''re in last place, but that doesn''t mean-ethy we have to stay there. I''m confident-ethy that you can get us out of last place. I know you can get us out last place! Please, get us out of last place...${prompt}'
  455: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Being in first place-ethy is good and all, but what matters is that we stay there when tabulation comes.${prompt}'
  456: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I trust that I''m not mistaken in deducing from our current ranking that we''re all just saving our energy-ethy for the final sprint? That is the plan, right?${prompt}'
  457: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I know they say all great science-ethy is built out of the marriage of trial and failure, but right now, I need you to fail less.${prompt}'
  458: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Now I know first place might look farther away than the moon from down here-ethy, but abandoning all hope of reaching it just because of that would be most illogical. So in that spirit, <ahem> go team-ethy! We can do it! <Cough-ethy> <Cough-ethy>${prompt}'
  459: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Bwahaha! For us? First place-ethy is but a trifle!${prompt}'
  460: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}To tell you the truth, I''ve been rather absorbed-ethy in my research lately. Are we in first place yet?${prompt}'
  461: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Inconceivable-ethy! How could we be so low in the rankings? Hurry! Go adventure! Do something-ethy!${prompt}'
  462: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Ask yourselves, do we belong in last place-ethy? Do we like it down here? No we don''t! Get us out! Get us out now!${prompt}'
  463: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  464: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  465: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  466: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Fascinating. These New Year''s creatures seem to appear and disappear each year without a trace-ethy. The Rhinostery has studied the principles of spontaneous generation for decades-ethy, but never produced any results.${prompt}'
  467: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Have you ever wondered what people really mean when they give out Valentione''s Day chocolates? I have a fascinating mind-reading study-ethy on the subject right here, if you want to lose your faith in humanity.${prompt}'
  468: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Of course, the Doll Festival-ethy! You must sample-ethy the Rhinostery''s new magical sweets!${prompt}'
  469: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Did you know that those initial eggs you adventurers love so much-ethy are really just painted chocobo eggs? What, did I spoil something?${prompt}'
  470: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Feast of Swords...that''s the festival where you dress-ethy up in armor and run around hitting each other with wooden stick-ethies, correct?${prompt}'
  471: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Those moogles in the capital cities have been at it all day-ethy. They keep stopping people in the streets and asking them if they''re adventurers. Do I look like one to you? Do I smell like one? <Grumble, grumble>...${prompt}'
  472: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I never understood the story-ethy behind Celestial Nights. Why didn''t they just take the ferry?${prompt}'
  473: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}They''ll be putting on Mumor''s show-ethy in Windurst Walls. I''m just hoping it doesn''t give Doctor Shantotto any strange ideas...${prompt}'
  474: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}There must be a discernible reason-ethy for this peculiar bovine behavior. If we isolate the causative factor-ethy, we can finally put an end to this silly buffalo business.${prompt}'
  475: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Now I know around Halloween all the kids like to dress-ethy up and ask for candy, but why go after candy when you could get shiny new test tubes?${prompt}'
  476: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}H-hold on a minute-ethy. Neither the Manustery nor the Rhinostery have anything to do with the rampant plant problem!${prompt}'
  477: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Did I ever tell you how we once donated-ethy holiday trees to each nation? Actually, forget I said that.${prompt}'
  478: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Apparently Unity accolades can currently be earned at double-ethy the usual rate. Fascinating. I wonder what power-ethies are at work here?${prompt}'
  479: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I don''t trust those moogles in the three nations. They''re up to something-ethy fishy. This bodes ill for all of us...${prompt}'
  480: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} was drawn in the ${zone: 2[2]} lottery! Congratulations-ethy to those who won!${prompt}'

  482: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The Rhinostery doesn''t only study plant-ethies. We are students of life.${prompt}'
  483: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}It''s done! It''s finally finished-ethy! You''ve never seen a more perfect manuscript!${prompt}'
  484: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}There''s every reason to believe that mandragora are flourishing-ethy in undiscovered lands as we speak! If only I could go everywhere...${prompt}'

  489: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Gaaargh! Who put-ethy all these cornettes up here!?${prompt}'
  490: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Of course my brain-ethy wants to maintain a diet, but my stomach, knowing what''s best-ethy for me, insists on another fruit parfait!${prompt}'

  495: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Our field researchers have sent a report-ethy from ${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?] in ${zone: 2[2]}. Apparently, monsters affiliated with ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl] have arrived there. Those guys are always getting themselves into trouble.${prompt}'
  496: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The Rhinostery field researchers in ${zone: 2[2]} have reported-ethy some unusual data around ${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?]. They think ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl] could show up there within ${number: 4} minutes.${prompt}'
  497: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Our field researchers in ${zone: 2[2]} have reported that ${choice: 4}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl/???] has appeared around ${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?]. What a rare research-ethy opportunity!${prompt}'
  498: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}New data-ethy from ${zone: 2[2]} suggests that ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl] is presently at ${number: 4}% HP ±${choice: 3}[0.15/0.2/0.1].${prompt}'
  499: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Excellent! The ${choice: 4}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl/???] specimen from ${zone: 2[2]} has been successfully defeated-ethy!${prompt}'
  500: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Most perplexing! The ${choice: 4}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl/???] specimen from ${zone: 2[2]} seems to have gotten away! What an unfortunate blow to our research-ethy.${prompt}'
  501: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}First place! Well done everyone! The ground''s the limit!${prompt}'
  502: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}We''re not in first place, but I think we did pretty well! If we try extra-specially hard this week, I''m sure we can raise our ranking!${prompt}'
  503: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Hey, at least we''re not...you know, last. Come on, team! I can feel it this week!${prompt}'
  504: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}So...bad news, everyone. It looks like we came in last. But here''s the good news: if we try super-duper-specially hard this week, I''m sure we can come in...you know, not last!${prompt}'
  505: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Good work, guys! All the signs point to us holding first place...I think.${prompt}'
  506: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}My visions tell me that we have a roughly...seventy percent chance of getting in first place from here...maybe.${prompt}'
  507: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}So...my visions are telling me that we have maybe, like, a thirty percent chance of getting in first place. I think that''s pretty good, what about you guys?${prompt}'
  508: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}So...based on our current ranking, my visions are saying that our chances of coming in last are...hey, you know what? Never mind. Everyone, just do your best, okay?${prompt}'
  509: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Great work, everyone! First place is just a hair''s throw away!${prompt}'
  510: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}If we keep at it, we can still get in first place. Let''s go the extra old college malm!${prompt}'
  511: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}At this point, it''ll take a miracle to get us in first place... Ahaha, I didn''t mean to say that out loud, sorry.${prompt}'
  512: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}We''re in last place, but that doesn''t mean we can''t still make it if we try really, really, extra-super hard, right?${prompt}'
  513: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  514: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  515: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  516: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Huh? Something in the Middle Lands is giving off a strong good-luck aura...something moving.${prompt}'
  517: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I wish Valentione''s Day would catch on in Adoulin. Everyone should be able to get chocolate, don''t you think?${prompt}'
  518: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Oooh, the Doll''s Festival! Don''t you just want to climb up there with them?${prompt}'
  519: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The Middle Lands have been giving off such a strong aura of...eggness? What''s going on over there?${prompt}'
  520: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The Middle Lands don''t feel right lately. I''m feeling a lot of aggression from that part of the world. You''d better be careful when traveling through there.${prompt}'
  521: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Wow! I''ve been feeling very positive emanations from the Middle Lands lately. You guys must have really done good over there.${prompt}'
  522: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I wonder if those two lovers from the legend ever managed to find each other in the stars... I mean, there are a lot of stars. I''d probably get lost.${prompt}'
  523: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Listen everyone! I just got the most fantabulous idea for a geomancer heroine show! What do you think?${prompt}'
  524: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The Middle Lands seem really riled up lately. I''m picking up a very...buffalo-ish aura? Weird.${prompt}'
  525: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Did you know that the exorcists who perform the Wake of the Lillies during Halloween have their head temple in Adoulin?${prompt}'
  526: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}There''s something horroriffic going on in the Middle Lands. P-plants!? Why do I sense plants!?${prompt}'
  527: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I wish Adoulin could get pretty holiday decorations like they have in the Middle Lands. A palm tree with lights is still a holiday tree, right?${prompt}'
  528: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Hey! You can earn double the usual amount of Unity accolades right now! That''s like hitting two stones with one bird!${prompt}'
  529: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}It might be a bad time to take a trip to the Middle Lands--there''s something big and scary floating around the three nations!${prompt}'
  530: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Have you heard about ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} being drawn in the ${zone: 2[2]} lottery? All disciples of Zacariah are prohibited from participating...awww...${prompt}'
  531: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}When running into trouble, good geomancers don''t struggle against their obstacles, but rather strengthen themselves through their communion with nature.${prompt}'
  532: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Remember, ergon energy isn''t unique to Ulbuka. You can feel the lifestream flowing throughout Vana''diel.${prompt}'
  533: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I wonder how they first discovered geomancy. Did they have the same spells we do now?${prompt}'
  534: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I once had to transcribe a three-hundred-year-old geomancy treatise. I could barely make heads or toes of the language they used back then.${prompt}'
  535: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Did you ever notice how silky smooth Wescolina''s skin is? She''s got to be infusing it with some kind of geomantic magic.${prompt}'
  536: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I forgot to return my library copy of “Sih Renaye and the Five Disciples” again. Andreine was so mad at me, but it''s not like I forgot on purpose...${prompt}'
  537: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Did you know that the geomantic luopans used to be a lot bigger? They''ve only started miniaturizing them a few decades ago. You used to have to wield it over your shoulder and make sure nobody was behind you before using it.${prompt}'
  538: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I''m no good at elemental magic. It''d be so nice to be able to go to Windurst one day to learn from the masters...${prompt}'
  539: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Ugh... Have you seen what Eukalline charges for geomantic plates?${prompt}'
  540: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}I smell jungle cookies... Okay, who brought jungle cookies and didn''t tell me?${prompt}'
  541: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  542: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  543: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}${prompt}'
  544: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Currently, we have taken down ${number: 3} ${choice-plurality: 3}[monster/monsters] in a row, which gives us a not-so-shabby total of ${number: 4} ${choice-plurality: 4}[monster/monsters] defeated.${prompt}'
  545: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}There appears to be a unit separate from ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl] out there. Please head to ${zone: 2[2]} (${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?]) and investigate.${prompt}'
  546: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Okay, everyone! I just had the weirdest vision. In the next ${number: 4} minutes, somebody called “${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl]” will be showing up in ${zone: 2[2]}, somewhere around ${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?]! Is that good?${prompt}'
  547: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Uh-oh! He''s here! That ${choice: 4}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl/???] guy''s showed up in ${zone: 2[2]} around ${choice: 3}[H-8/H-9/?-?], and he seems super duper mad.${prompt}'
  548: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}The ${choice: 3}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl] guy in ${zone: 2[2]} feels like he''s at around ${number: 4}% HP, I think.${prompt}'
  549: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}Oh wow, good job, everyone! That ${choice: 4}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl/???] guy in ${zone: 2[2]} is all beaten up. I think we won! Yay!${prompt}'
  550: '${unity: 0[2], 1[2]}So...guys, don''t get mad, but I lost track of ${choice: 4}[Azi Dahaka/Naga Raja/Quetzalcoatl/???]''s aura in ${zone: 2[2]}. Where did he go?${prompt}'
