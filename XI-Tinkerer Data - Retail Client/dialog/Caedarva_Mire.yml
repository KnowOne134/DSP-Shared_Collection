  7743: You don't know my mother. She could even try to drag me back home. I might never see you again...${prompt}
  7744: Ahgdeen, you're not as weak as you think. I'm sure you'll be okay.${prompt}
  7745: Basweema...${prompt}
  7746: You've helped me out in more ways than you can know. Thank you.${prompt}
  7747: I will have a talk with my mother.${prompt}
  7748: Do you think you could come along, too?${prompt}
  7749: I'm sure my mother wouldn't hurt Basweema, but still...I want you there to watch.${prompt}
  7750: Was the operation successful?${prompt}
  7751: I almost had him...but there was interference, and the operation ended in failure.${prompt}
  7752: I see... Your disguise will not work far from the mire...${prompt}
  7753: We must devise a new plan...${prompt}
  7754: Basweema!${prompt}
  7755: Ahgdeen!? But why?${prompt}
  7756: Ohoho, this is interesting. The fool yearns to become a sacrifice, does he? I am tired of this boy... Dispose of him.${prompt}
  7757: Basweema, please. Listen to what I have to say.${prompt}
  7758: '...${prompt}'
  7759: I want to be with you. I want to live together! I still feel that way, even now.${prompt}
  7760: '...${prompt}'
  7761: Please come with me, Basweema.${prompt}
  7762: There is nothing more pathetic than a man who begs...${prompt}
  7763: Ahhh!${prompt}
  7764: Run...hurry!${prompt}
  7765: Why did it have to come to this!?${prompt}
  7766: Controlled by your own desires... You are a disgrace to the Lamiae.${prompt}
  7767: It is time for you to rest, traitor!
  7768: Basweema!!!
  7769: Basweema! Stay with me, Basweema!${prompt}
  7770: Ahgdeen...?${prompt}
  7771: Heh...to think, I was about to turn you into a qutrub... Such a disappointment...${prompt}
  7772: Basweema...${prompt}
  7773: You know...I believe that not everyone who chooses an undead existence was charmed by the Lamiae...${prompt}
  7774: But there are some, like me, whose feelings are genuine...${prompt}
  7775: I don't want to lose you. I want to be together for all eternity...${prompt}
  7776: And if that means becoming a qutrub, I'm willing to do it!${prompt}
  7777: Ahgdeen...I have never met someone so kind.${prompt}
  7778: I have but one request. Please take me to the place where we first met.${prompt}
  7779: I'm really sorry my mother said such horrible things.${prompt}
  7780: There's no need for you to apologize. I'm okay, really.${prompt}
  7781: But I think I made a bad impression on your mother...${prompt}
  7782: It certainly is hard to win a mother-in-law's favor, isn't it?${prompt}
  7783: Heh, I'm sure that if you work at it, you'll be fine.${prompt}
  7784: Anyway, didn't you drop an earring somewhere around here a while ago?${prompt}
  7785: It was you who dropped it, while you were trying to see how it looked on me!${prompt}
  7786: Is that how it was...?${prompt}
  7787: You always forget things when they're your own fault...${prompt}
  7788: Ahgdeen?${prompt}
  7789: What is it?${prompt}
  7790: When you told me in front of your mother that you were going to marry me... I was very happy.${prompt}
  7791: But I betrayed both you and my kind...I hid the fact that I am a Lamia, and I couldn't even turn you into a qutrub.${prompt}
  7792: You are not weak, Ahgdeen... I was the weak one. I'm so sorry...${prompt}
  7793: Basweema... You betrayed no one. You protected me, even though you knew what it would cost you.${prompt}
  7794: Thank you...${prompt}
  7795: I'm going to tell you what I couldn't bring myself to say before...${prompt}
  7796: '...'
  7797: What is it?${prompt}
  7798: I love you. More than anything.${prompt}
  7799: Basweema...? You heard me, right? Say something...${prompt}
  7800: You're not teasing me again, are you?${prompt}
  7801: Haha, you may have fooled me before, but you won't get me this time...${prompt}
  7802: So give it up already, all right? Open your eyes...${prompt}
  7803: |-
    Please?
    ...Basweema...?${prompt}
  7804: All I wanted was to live happily together...${prompt}
  7805: But now, I can never have her back. So tell me, who is to blame for it?${prompt}
  7806: My mother, because she tried to force me to return home? You, because you came to search for me? Or the Lamia who hurt her?${prompt}
  7807: '...${prompt}'
  7808: I'm sorry. Pointing fingers won't bring her back...${prompt}
  7809: This is the ring I was going to give her.${prompt}
  7810: I intended to use it when I proposed to her, but that's not going to happen now...${prompt}
  7811: Goodbye, Basweema...${prompt}
  7812: |-
    You lost your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?
    Typical mercenary...${prompt}
  7813: Here, take this and get out of my sight!${prompt}

  7815: Do you know how long it takes to get those things reissued?${prompt}
  7816: |-
    Good-for-nothing, rock-headed mercenaries!
    Take your worthless hide out of here and gimme time to forget your oafish face!${prompt}
  7817: Hey, admiral-type person!${prompt}
  7818: '...${prompt}'
  7819: Where is this ship headed to?${prompt}
  7820: Dvucca Isle.${prompt}
  7821: Oho.${prompt}
  7822: |-
    Now I know our destination.
    We're going to Periqia.${prompt}
  7823: He's right, isn't he?${prompt}
  7824: Periqia...${prompt}
  7825: I've heard stories about that place.${prompt}
  7826: A long time ago, it was said to have been a base for the Ephramadian corsairs, who would terrorize merchant vessels sailing the neighboring waters.${prompt}
  7827: |-
    <Shiver>...
    They attacked innocent traders?${prompt}
  7828: Traders from Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  7829: But one day the corsairs were caught in a violent storm, and they all sank to the bottom of the ocean.${prompt}
  7830: Not all of us...${prompt}
  7831: '...?${prompt}'
  7832: What has become of Periqia without the corsairs?${prompt}
  7833: Could the ghosts we've been hearing about have taken over the base?${prompt}
  7834: Spirits of the corsairs, maybe...?${prompt}
  7835: |-
    Hmph.
    And how would you feel if that were the case?${prompt}
  7836: I would be...${prompt}
  7837: Excited!${prompt}
  7838: Yes, this all sounds very exciting!${prompt}
  7839: |-
    Exciting?
    You could be killed.${prompt}
  7840: |-
    But...but...
    Just because they're ghosts now, doesn't mean they don't remember their families and friends, right?${prompt}
  7841: They would have to be sad, and lonely, and...${prompt}
  7842: '...suffering all this time, missing their loved ones.${prompt}'
  7843: They probably repented their evil pirate ways and vowed to be good from now on...${prompt}
  7844: And...${prompt}
  7845: And?${prompt}
  7846: And the crew of this ship has been so nice to us!${prompt}
  7847: They were a little frightening at first...${prompt}
  7848: But they even gave me oil when my helmet started creaking.${prompt}
  7849: Is that right...?${prompt}
  7850: '!?${prompt}'
  7851: '...${prompt}'
  7852: What is it, Admiral?${prompt}
  7853: Silence!
  7854: |-
    That sound...
    There's no mistaking it!${prompt}
  7855: |-
    Oh yes, now I hear it.
    Sounds like an apkallu being strangled to death...${prompt}
  7856: I will never forget that sound...${prompt}
  7857: Never forget the tears...the blood...the bones...of that day.${prompt}
  7858: Blood?${prompt}
  7859: Bones?${prompt}
  7860: Lamiae...${prompt}
  7861: That sound is the shriek of the whistle used by the Imperial Army to control their pet Lamiae.${prompt}
  7862: |-
    That can't be right.
    Lamiae are enemies of the Empire.${prompt}
  7863: Those that broke free.${prompt}
  7864: It was two hundred years ago when our hideout was invaded by biological weapons of destruction, sent by the Imperial forces in an attempt to extinguish the last of the corsairs.${prompt}
  7865: Those monstrosities were the artificially created Lamiae.${prompt}
  7866: |-
    You're lying!
    The Lamiae attack everyone, even the capital of Al Zahbi!${prompt}
  7867: |-
    Heh.
    Their pets turn against them.${prompt}
  7868: They were just one of the many heinous blunders made by the Empire.${prompt}
  7869: The Imperial Army--and Aht Urhgan--is invincible!${prompt}
  7870: |-
    Why would they bother with anything as hideous as the Lamiae!?
    Besides, the Empress would never allow it!${prompt}
  7871: |-
    You doubt me?
    Come see for yourself!${prompt}
  7872: |-
    What should we do, Aphmau?
    He must be lying.${prompt}
  7873: |-
    Of course he is.
    It can't be true...${prompt}
  7874: If the Grand Vizier were here, he would say:${prompt}
  7875: “Trust your own eyes.”${prompt}
  7876: You've found nothing?${prompt}
  7877: |-
    Grand Vizier.
    We are scouring every inch, but this place is like a labyrinth...${prompt}
  7878: Spare me your excuses.${prompt}
  7879: I accepted your proposal to make use of the Lamiae's acute sense of smell in spite of vocal protest from the generals, and against my better judgment.${prompt}
  7880: Understand that you will not be leaving this rock until Her Magnificence is back under our protection.${prompt}
  7881: These Lamiae have been enhanced through advanced alchemical processes, Grand Vizier.${prompt}
  7882: I assure you, we will locate the Empress.${prompt}
  7883: You better hope you are right.${prompt}
  7884: You seem surprised, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7885: This operation should never have been necessary.${prompt}
  7886: I must admit, I did not expect you to be here to witness it.${prompt}
  7887: As I feared...${prompt}
  7888: Who is that? The one in red armor?${prompt}
  7889: It looks like the Grand Vizier...${prompt}
  7890: |-
    It can't be!
    There must be some mistake...${prompt}
  7891: |-
    You seem distraught.
    Does it shock you to see your countrymen working alongside those abominations?${prompt}
  7892: Or perhaps...you know this man in red armor?${prompt}
  7893: Yes...${prompt}
  7894: |-
    And so you should.
    He is, after all--${prompt}
  7895: My brother...${prompt}
  7896: What?${prompt}
  7897: He is my brother...${prompt}
  7898: What are the Lamiae saying?${prompt}
  7899: That she is close...very close...${prompt}
  7900: |-
    Then cover this area again!
    Leave no pebble undisturbed!${prompt}
  7901: Your will...${prompt}
  7902: No...${prompt}
  7903: |-
    !
    My mercenary...${prompt}
  7904: |-
    Of course!
    This is just some horrible misunderstanding.${prompt}
  7905: |-
    There's some big picture that I'm just not seeing.
    All I have to do is ask!${prompt}
  7906: Razfahd!
  7907: '...${prompt}'
  7908: You force my hand...
  7909: Come along with me...${prompt}
  7910: '!'
  7911: Nash...${prompt}
  7912: What...what are you doing here, Razfahd?${prompt}
  7913: |-
    I received a report that you had been abducted.
    Are you unhurt?${prompt}
  7914: I'm fine, obviously.${prompt}
  7915: So you're the one who took her...${prompt}
  7916: No, he didn't do anything!${prompt}
  7917: I followed him of my own free will!${prompt}
  7918: |-
    You followed him?
    What were you thinking?${prompt}
  7919: You can't just chase after every strange character who catches your eye...${prompt}
  7920: Do you have any idea of the danger...?${prompt}
  7921: '...${prompt}'
  7922: You're trying to lecture me?${prompt}
  7923: You're the one who's working alongside Lamiae--sworn enemies of the Empire!${prompt}
  7924: |-
    Don't you understand?
    I was using these creatures to look for you.${prompt}
  7925: |-
    That's no excuse.
    Those “creatures” are evil savages!${prompt}
  7926: |-
    You're the one who used to tell me that when I was a child!
    Are you saying that was a lie?${prompt}
  7927: |-
    Grand Vizier!
    Answer her question!${prompt}
  7928: Calm down, Aphmau...${prompt}
  7929: Answer the question!${prompt}
  7930: Are you saying you don't have an answer?${prompt}
  7931: |-
    Listen to me, Aphmau.
    These creations are not the same Lamiae I have taught you to fear and despise.${prompt}
  7932: They are aiding our army, as allies to the people of Aradjiah.${prompt}
  7933: |-
    They are like your mercenary, ${name-player}.
    You have nothing to fear from them.${prompt}
  7934: Mercenaries...? Like ${name-player}?${prompt}
  7935: That's right.${prompt}
  7936: Ahahaha...${prompt}
  7937: Your lies know no bounds.${prompt}
  7938: Nothing to fear?${prompt}
  7939: Not for their twisted masters, perhaps.${prompt}
  7940: “Allies to the people of Aradjiah,” you say?${prompt}
  7941: These vicious demonesses that feasted on the flesh of my still-living companions!?${prompt}
  7942: |-
    Who are you?
    And what would you know of it?${prompt}
  7943: I know all your filthy secrets.${prompt}
  7944: The words of a lunatic.${prompt}
  7945: |-
    That costume you wear...
    You are descendant of the corsairs?${prompt}
  7946: No, they wouldn't dare show themselves so openly.${prompt}
  7947: I know who you are...${prompt}
  7948: And now that you know?${prompt}
  7949: Will you set your pets on me?${prompt}
  7950: Just as your ancestors did?${prompt}
  7951: It can't be...${prompt}
  7952: Is it true, what he says?${prompt}
  7953: |-
    Grand Vizier.
    We require an answer.${prompt}
  7954: Aphmau...${prompt}
  7955: Do you remember the last words of our father?${prompt}
  7956: '...${prompt}'
  7957: |-
    “We are the Emperor.
    The Emperor and Aht Urhgan are as one...”${prompt}
  7958: '!'
  7959: |-
    Words that you took for your own.
    They do more than describe the absolute authority of the Emperor...${prompt}
  7960: They also signify a responsibility.${prompt}
  7961: A responsibility to protect the lives of the tens of thousands of citizens from our countless enemies within and without the vast territories of Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  7962: There are times when carrying out this responsibility requires extreme measures.${prompt}
  7963: But...${prompt}
  7964: Those are not the only words he used.${prompt}
  7965: He also said, “A heavy hand is not needed to govern an empire.”${prompt}
  7966: “A gentle hand will guide the people.”${prompt}
  7967: |-
    Anyone can see that the use of Lamiae is going too far.
    You're twisting the spirit of his teachings.${prompt}
  7968: |-
    Aphmau...
    A time will come when you will understand.${prompt}
  7969: You always do this.${prompt}
  7970: |-
    Whenever an important matter arises, you treat me like a child.
    I'm supposed to listen to whatever you decide.${prompt}
  7971: And you expect me to accept the responsibilities of an empress?${prompt}
  7972: Nashmeira!${prompt}
  7973: You do not have the will to be Empress.${prompt}
  7974: You are not prepared to allow your subjects to bleed while you remain unsullied on your throne.${prompt}
  7975: Why is this role so hard for you to comprehend?${prompt}
  7976: If I'm so unsuitable...${prompt}
  7977: Why...
  7978: Why don't you become Emperor!?${prompt}
  7979: This isn't a game, Nashmeira!${prompt}
  7980: Listen to me!${prompt}
  7981: I was once destined to sit the Imperial throne...${prompt}
  7982: But as our father lay on his deathbed, he named you as his successor.${prompt}
  7983: I don't know what you're talking about...${prompt}

  7985: Do you know why?${prompt}

    How should I know?
    I don't want to know...${prompt}

  7989: At the time when our father named you successor...${prompt}
  7990: '...the blood of beasts flowed in my veins, just as it does in these creations.${prompt}'

    I didn't...

  7996: I received a mortal wound while fighting on the eastern front at the behest of our father.${prompt}
  7997: '!${prompt}'
  7998: The only chance I had to survive was a transfusion of regenerative blood from a monstrous donor.${prompt}

  8000: Now do you understand?${prompt}
  8001: I do...${prompt}
  8002: Now please, do as I say and return to the palace.${prompt}
  8003: I will, but...${prompt}

  8171: The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called “Voidwalkers.” Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt}
  8172: |-
    Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.
    This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt}
  8173: Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt}
  8174: A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt}
  8175: Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt}
  8176: |-
    Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.
    Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt}
  8177: Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt}
  8178: Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt}
  8179: However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt}
  8180: |-
    When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.
    These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt}
  8181: Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt}
  8182: The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt}
  8183: |-
    Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.
    Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt}
  8184: As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt}
  8185: Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt}
  8186: Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt}
  8187: After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt}
  8188: Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt}
  8189: Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  8190: While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  8191: Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt}
  8192: Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt}
  8193: Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt}
  8194: Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt}
  8195: Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt}
  8196: The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt}
  8197: The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt}
  8198: Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt}
  8199: 'Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt}'

  8201: Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}
  8202: Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.${prompt}
  8203: Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.${prompt}
  8204: As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.${prompt}

  9120: |-
    I suppose we won't be getting any more inform-m-mation out of this one.
    We have no choice but to take it out.
  9121: '${color-alt: 123}One or more of your party members do not meet the prerequisites for this battle.${prompt}'
  9122: '${color-alt: 123}One or more of your party members are not in the appropriate staging zone.${prompt}'
  9123: '${color-alt: 123}One or more of your party members are currently viewing a cutscene.${prompt}'
  9124: A monster most fexing approaches!
  9125: Hmph. I had expected much better of you.${prompt}
  9126: |-
    This wom-m-man...
    What is this power she possesses within?
  9127: |-
    Some sort of life force?
    Are the blue mages trying to fuse m-m-monsters with the power of life?${prompt}
  9128: Erk!? <Cough, gasp>...
  9129: Hm? What is this?${prompt}
  9130: I... I am no longer a blue mage...${prompt}
  9131: It appears the m-m-magical power within you has been absorbed by this “Prison Orb.”${prompt}
  9132: If you are looking for som-m-meone to blame, you should blame your m-m-master for doing this to you.${prompt}
  9133: |-
    Why would I want someone to blame?
    In fact, I should be thanking you.${prompt}
  9134: I am the Immortal known as Amnaf.${prompt}
  9135: Hm!? Is that you, ${name-player}!?${prompt}
  9136: Tell me, what happened to the Grand Vizier!?${prompt}

  9138: What!? Wait, does that mean that he has gone on to Valhalla too?${prompt}
  9139: |-
    No, I cannot dwell on that now...
    There is important news that concerns the fate of the Empire.
  9140: I need you to report something back to Captain Raubahn for me.${prompt}
  9141: There is a large-scale war brewing in Valhalla, land of the chosen souls...${prompt}
  9142: There is an open rebellion against Odin, the god who controls Valhalla.${prompt}
  9143: The mage leading the rebellion appeared alongside a massive dragon...${prompt}
  9144: What did you say!?
  9145: He used magic to convert countless souls into his minions, bringing them back to life in an effort to force open the gate to Valhalla.${prompt}
  9146: He has also chosen Rishfee's soul among them, in order to use the power of the blue mages...${prompt}
  9147: That is why I went to meet this mage, in order to find Rishfee.${prompt}
  9148: The mage said he was looking to bring about the resurrection of Falak in Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  9149: That he wished to bring chaos down upon the land of the living.${prompt}
  9150: Wait! What is this m-m-mage's name!?${prompt}
  9151: |-
    His name is...
    <Cough, gasp>...
  9152: Forgive me, I...
  9153: Hang in there!
  9154: |-
    Rishfee...
    You must save him...
  9155: Blast! We alm-m-most had the answer we were looking for!${prompt}
  9156: What should I do in regards to Falak...${prompt}
  9157: No, I m-m-must first figure out how the gate to Valhalla can be opened...${prompt}
  9158: Hmm... They m-m-must've found something upsetting within the facility.${prompt}
  9159: Don't worry about it! It doesn't matter when we were born or when we die!${prompt}
  9160: B-but this truth is almost too shocking to believe...${prompt}
  9161: Hraaaah! We mandragora were created by humans!${prompt}
  9162: That just means you have kin such as Lamiae, puks, and Merrows right there with you!${prompt}
  9163: |-
    So don't worry about it! Just focus on living your best life now.
    That's all that matters, got it!?${prompt}
  9164: Hraaaah! The chosen elite such as yourself can't possibly understand what I'm feeling!${prompt}
  9165: The mandragora should never have been born, so we were abandoned!${prompt}
  9166: Hey! Who are you calling elite!?${prompt}
  9167: Come on now, let's all settle down.${prompt}
  9168: The real villains here are the ones who dreamed up such a hideous plan in the first place.${prompt}
  9169: They are toying with actual lives here. We should be blaming the alchemists, not each other.${prompt}
  9170: Hraaaah! That Moblin is gonna pay for this!${prompt}
  9171: Huh!? Megomak is a good friend who gives us a place to stay!${prompt}
  9172: See, that's what I'm talking about! Those of us who've been abandoned would rather live freezing under a bridge!${prompt}
  9173: Now, now... Try to calm down a bit.${prompt}
  9174: Maybe we shouldn't have agreed to Megomak's request.${prompt}
  9175: W-we located the egg he's looking for, but it's not going to be easy...${prompt}
  9176: |-
    I don't get what he's so mad about...
    Mandragoras are a completely different story.${prompt}
  9177: M-m-my head is starting to hurt just listening to all this..${prompt}
  9178: Should we get m-m-moving?
  9179: Hm? What's with that puppet?
  9180: Stop right there, Uran-Mafran.${prompt}
  9181: The Empress has ordered me to escort you back to Al Zahbi.${prompt}
  9182: What?
  9183: First, I will need to take your belongings.${prompt}
  9184: Wait! Wait right there!
  9185: Huh!? Who is this!?${prompt}
  9186: Curse you people! You dare to toy with others' lives for your own amusement!${prompt}
  9187: Hey! What's gotten into you!?${prompt}
  9188: T-try to calm down...${prompt}
  9189: Hm? What is going on here, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  9190: It's a little hard to explain. We m-m-might want to silence that talking plant first though.${prompt}
  9191: Settle down, citrullus.${prompt}
  9192: Who are you calling a citrullus!?${prompt}
  9193: You're gonna pay for that insult!
  9194: Hraaaah!
  9195: Skreee!
  9196: <Sputter>...
  9197: |-
    Hey, what's the big idea!?
    Beatin' on innocent beings like that without even listening to what they have to say first!${prompt}
  9198: Y-you've got us all wrong...${prompt}
  9199: ${name-player}, do you know what they are talking about?${prompt}
  9200: |-
    How do you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    Mandragoras are actually chimeras.
    You shouldn't have called him a citrullus.
    Magh Bihu was abandoned.${prompt}
  9201: 'Chimeras: the creation of life using forbidden alchemy techniques.${prompt}'
  9202: Yes, I can only imagine the shock of learning the truth about such a thing.${prompt}
  9203: I know it's strange coming from me, but I can't help but sympathize with his plight.${prompt}
  9204: However, that is not what I want to know.${prompt}
  9205: |-
    Citrullus: plantoid and subspecies of the mandragora.
    Known for the black striped pattern on its green skin.${prompt}
  9206: That is all I know. Or more precisely, that is all I care to know.${prompt}
  9207: Who is this Magh Bihu and what do you mean by abandoned?${prompt}
  9208: No, it doesn't matter. That isn't what I am asking.${prompt}
  9209: What I want to know is who are these wild and barbaric creatures?${prompt}
  9210: |-
    They are the...
    ${selection-lines}
    Destiny Destroyers.
    Destroyers of Destiny.
    Destroyed Derelicts.${prompt}
  9211: That's not what I am asking; I wish to understand why they are here.${prompt}
  9212: We were just looking for something for a friend of ours!${prompt}
  9213: Huh!? Where did it...${prompt}
  9214: '${color-alt: 15}${name-player} showed Gloom Phantom the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.'
  9215: Oh! That's my friend's! That belongs to Megomak!${prompt}
  9216: Megomak... I heard from Ghatsad that you were sent to negotiate with Megomak.${prompt}
  9217: Huh!? Are you friends with Megomak too?${prompt}
  9218: |-
    <Sputter>...
    Megomak... Alchemist... Must punish...${prompt}
  9219: B-by the way, what exactly are you? A ch-chimera?${prompt}
  9220: A chimera!? You dare call me a chimera!?${prompt}
  9221: |-
    That's it, I'm taking you and Uran-Mafran back to Al Zahbi.
    You're going to tell me everything you know!${prompt}
  9222: I hope you're ready for the indescribable horrors you're about to face!${prompt}
  9223: Halt, Uran-Mafran!
  9224: Don't worry, you'll be seeing m-m-me again shortly.${prompt}
  9225: Hmm... What is he up to?${prompt}
  9226: |-
    I wonder what's going through his mind...
    I must report back to Nashmeira at once.${prompt}
  9227: They're getting away!
  9228: Hurry! You've got to get that egg to Megomak!${prompt}
  9229: |-
    Hey, wait!
    He's not waiting... Curse you...
  9230: 'Curse you, ${choice: 2}[Destiny Destroyers/Destroyers of Destiny/Destroyed Derelicts]!'
  9231: 'It appears you need to deliver the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} to Megomak.${prompt}'
