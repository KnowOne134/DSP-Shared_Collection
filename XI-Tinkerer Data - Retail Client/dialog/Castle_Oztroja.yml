    Congratulations.

    You have found me.${prompt}

  7874: Such a long dream I was having...${prompt}
  7875: |-
    It was a dream held captive by a shrouded world.
    No. I must accept that it was no dream.${prompt}

    And you? Do you seek the same darkness that I did...
    It seems you have already found your way to ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}

    Very well, I will pass it on to you.
    But do not forget how much blood your companions spilled in your search for its unholy strength.${prompt}

    Heh. Heh heh.
    Hahahahahahaha!${prompt}
  7881: |-
    Well, my new master, is it not time to begin the journey for ever greater power?
    There are enemies yet to fell, and blood yet to spill...${prompt}
  7882: |-
    ...
    You have unearthed me at last.${prompt}
  7883: I am free from Dynamis, free to fly through the heavens once more.${prompt}

    Hello?

    But, no.
    I have not returned to this realm...

    Think well on what this means, and on how a weapon like this should be used.

  7895: You must now gain the sanction of my master...${prompt}
  7896: It is a pity, indeed.${prompt}
  7897: This day has come far too soon for my liking.${prompt}
  7898: |-
    However, you are a master of the ninja trade.
    I concede that you will make a fitting wielder of the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}

    Take this blade as your own.
    Travel far down the path of the ninja.${prompt}

  7902: A fine master...${prompt}
  7903: My keen edge is now yours to wield. A sharpness said to make even demons wail...${prompt}
  7904: |-
    ...
    This day has finally come.${prompt}
  7905: |-
    I am to be released to this world for the first time in an age.

  7906: In any event...${prompt}
  7907: What is going on here?${prompt}
  7908: Ah, my successor has come.${prompt}
  7909: 'I sought to master the way of the samurai, and traveled to the Far East for training. By the time I had gained the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and returned to my home, the Great War had begun.${prompt}'
  7910: When I think on it, my life has been a long road of trials. But to see the arrival of my successor makes me feel that all has not been in vain.${prompt}

  7917: You have proven me wrong...${prompt}
  7918: I have heard of your coming.${prompt}
  7919: You are to be the new master of this hammer of war?${prompt}
  7920: |-
    Every time ${item-singular: 0[2]} is reborn it gains a new wielder, who ultimately must pass it on to a successor.
    I have swung this hammer for more than eight hundred years. I never wished to part with it.${prompt}
  7921: "However, there is little meaning in me keeping it now. \nIf you will wield this weapon for a just cause, I hand its power over to you.${prompt}"
  7922: |-
    Now, take the hammer and go!
    Just be careful with how you handle it.
    Do not let its might crush you as well...${prompt}
  7923: '...${prompt}'
  7924: My might is yours to wield.${prompt}
  7925: Go forth and experience the destructive power that laid low the Earth Serpent...${prompt}

    I must give you my thanks.
    I have been freed from the hell of Dynamis and can regain my true power once again.${prompt}
  7928: And now...${prompt}
  7929: Hwaah!${prompt}
  7930: Just when I thought I had finally returned to this world, I find you standing here, ready to snatch my precious staff away.${prompt}
  7931: |-
    Well, it's for the best, I suppose.
    In my current state, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is nothing more than an ornament, its power going to waste.${prompt}
  7932: |-
    I entrust this staff to you!
    Take up ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${name-player}, and bind it to you in a contract of blood!${prompt}

    I take my leave of you now.
    I only wish that I was able to stay a little longer...${prompt}
  7934: '...${prompt}'

    But you are not yet my master.

  7937: |-
    ...
    You have discovered my resting place.${prompt}
  7938: |-
    The prison of souls has let loose its shackles, and I am free to loose arrows in this world once more.

  7939: Ah, one more test of your patience...${prompt}
  7940: Where is this place?${prompt}
  7941: |-
    Of course. How could I forget.
    I am Ghebben. I was entrusted with this bow by a warrior of the Far East.${prompt}
  7942: |-
    Your hands tell me that your skill in archery is far from ordinary.
    ${item-singular: 0[2]} will fit snugly into your sure grasp.${prompt}
  7943: |-
    However, this bow belongs to Sir Nasu, the warrior of whom I spoke.
    You must remember that you are merely its keeper for a time.${prompt}
  7944: Farewell...${prompt}
  7945: '...${prompt}'
  7946: |-
    It is an honor to be owned by a just master.
    Sir Ghebben was a truly splendid archer.${prompt}
  7947: |-
    You are now the one to draw me in battle.
    I will be at your side on any road you choose to travel, along with the destructive power of my arrows.${prompt}
  7948: |-
    ...
    We finally meet.${prompt}
  7949: I am now free from the pit of Dynamis to spit fire in this world once again.${prompt}
  7950: But I must ask you to wait before taking me into your possession...${prompt}
  7951: |-
    Why'd you have to go and wake me up? I was having the most relaxing sleep.
    Oh, this place looks familiar...${prompt}
  7952: Hm? You think you're the one who's going to take up my gun?${prompt}
  7953: 'You do seem to have a fair eye for marksmanship. And ${item-singular: 0[2]} would look perfect nestled in the crook of your arm...${prompt}'
  7954: Well, I have no more use for this weapon, so I guess you can have it. But there is one thing I want you to remember.${prompt}
  7955: This gun is a fearsome weapon that unleashes a blast upon your enemies many thousands of times greater in strength than the tiny effort it takes you to pull the trigger. Needless to say, be careful who you aim it at...${prompt}
  7956: '...${prompt}'
  7957: A weapon has no will of its own. But it was made for a purpose.${prompt}
  7958: Take me to a new battlefield, a new arena for the hunt...${prompt}
  7959: |-
    ...
    I am saved.${prompt}
  7960: Silenced for too long in the prison of Dynamis, I can once again let my brazen call echo through this land!${prompt}
  7961: A few more moments, if you please...${prompt}
  7962: |-
    Hello there.
    I am Terounalivet, a military musician of the Hydra Corps.${prompt}
  7963: |-
    You've never heard of me?
    Before joining the army I was quite the famous bard, mobbed by fans in every town I passed through.${prompt}
  7964: 'To be completely truthful, I am heartbroken to be giving up the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the most famous of instruments, even to a fellow bard.${prompt}'
  7965: But an instrument only shows its true worth when being played. This horn should be delighted to be passed on to such a talent as yourself.${prompt}
  7966: She has a capricious soul, but do treat her well. And do not forget that even without a raging battle, you can still play a tune for the simple enjoyment of those around you...${prompt}
  7967: '...${prompt}'
  7968: He was a wonderful performer.${prompt}
  7969: |-
    Let us be on our way.
    Our tour of the world has only just begun...${prompt}
  7970: Are you ready for a spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?${prompt}

    We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon.

  7975: Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!${prompt}
  7976: |-
    Wear the yukata the next time you come to see me!
    I can't wait to see how you look, kupo!${prompt}
  7977: |-
    Partner up with lots of different adventurers and bring back all kinds of trophies to prove your courage!
    When you've brought enough, I'll give you something really special, kupo!${prompt}
  7978: |-
    The face in the portrait you brought me is just...
    Kupupupu!${prompt}
  7979: |-
    Incredible, kupo!
    You must have nerves of darksteel!
    Here, you've earned this, kupo!${prompt}

    You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo?
    Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.${prompt}
  7981: |-
    You haven't earned my really special present yet!
    Only truly dauntless dungeon-delvers get that, kupo!${prompt}
  7982: This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!${prompt}
  7983: |-
    To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal.
    Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!${prompt}
  7984: |-
    This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties.
    Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!${prompt}

    Please come back with a different partner.
    It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!${prompt}

    Your partner isn't ready to go.
    Please wait a little longer, kupo.${prompt}
  7987: |-

  7988: |-
    You can only choose one partner a day.
    Come back again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt}
  7989: |-
    Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner!
    You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!${prompt}
  7990: Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.${prompt}
  7991: Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?${prompt}
  7992: |-
    Are you ready to go?
    ${selection-lines}

    Hey, you changed partners!
    You can't switch halfway through, kupo!${prompt}
  7998: |-
    Wait, the number of people in your party has changed!
    You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!${prompt}

  8002: |-
    Here, take this as a testament to your courage.
    Exchange it for the item your partner received so you can prove that you both reached the goal safely, kupo!${prompt}
  8003: Return with the evidence of your success to the moogle in town. Handing over your partner's item will prove that you were both able to reach me, kupo!${prompt}
  8004: |-
    Oh, and here's a picture of how your partner's face looked when I popped out of nowhere to scare you. You should hand this in at the same time, kupo!
    Kupupupu...${prompt}
