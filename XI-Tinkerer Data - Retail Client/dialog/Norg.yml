  10197: Tell them I sent you, and they will assist you with your preparations for the journey. Also, if you come across any trouble, you may ask them for further aid. However, I doubt you will require it.${prompt}
  10198: When you have gathered the two items, bring them directly to me and I will begin my work.${prompt}
  10199: Wonderful. These are the materials that I require. I apologize, but I must hurry or Gilgamesh will have my head. I will reward you for your services when I have finished the katana.${prompt}
  10200: How long will it take, you ask? A good blade takes at least three full days to complete. Come to me then. You need not worry. I will be right here.${prompt}
  10201: Again, I apologize for not being able to give you your reward sooner.${prompt}
  10202: 'My work is not yet complete. I still require ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[more hour/more hours]. It is not wise to waste your time trying to outrun the clock in this game we call life.${prompt}'
  10203: Time is like a flowing river--it cannot be sped up or slowed down. We must float along at the pace it has chosen.${prompt}
  10204: Ah, ${name-player}, you have finally returned. I was beginning to worry that you had forgotten about your reward.${prompt}
  10205: Now where did I put that...${prompt}
  10206: Arrrg, if it isn't our little helper ${choice-player-gender}[boy/girl]!${prompt}
  10207: Gilgamesh.${prompt}
  10208: Ya did some mighty fine work in gettin' me matey, Jauc, his materials. Thanks t'you, I got meself a fine new blade.${prompt}
  10209: Listen carefully, ${name-player}. Within a katana, the soul of its maker and the soul of its wielder are intertwined.${prompt}
  10210: That newfangled crystal synthesis you adventurers be usin' is all fine fer mantles and arrows, but it can't copy the traditional methods. One must know the essentials behind a blade if they ever want t'master it.${prompt}
  10211: That's why we make adventurers like you go on quests like that last one. We want you t'know the true meanin' of wieldin' a blade like this.${prompt}
  10212: Know the meaning of the power you hold, and only then will you find the true power within. That be “bushido,” the way of the samurai.${prompt}
  10213: Yer adventures have already trained you t'become a samurai. Now all that's left is for ya t'pledge your faith t'this blade. Yer power within will do the rest.${prompt}
  10214: Rid yerself of all unnecessary thoughts and feel the world around ya. Make yer soul an unclouded mirror...a motionless pond. Project yerself into yer blade. This be the legendary skill used by the samurai--“Meikyo Shisui.”${prompt}
  10215: 'Take this ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${name-player}. This blade was forged fer ya. Pledge your life t''her an'' she won''t let ya down.${prompt}'
  10216: |-
    You accept the ${item-singular: 0[2]} from Gilgamesh.
    You can now become a samurai.${prompt}
  10217: I wish to give you your reward, but you seem to be carrying too much already. Come back when you have more room in your pack.${prompt}
  10218: Crystal technology has helped Vana'diel prosper, but at the cost of traditional methods, now lost forever.${prompt}
  10219: Just as the old is replaced by the new, the world is constantly changing. One day, one may no longer be able to live by a single blade alone.${prompt}
  10220: 'So, you need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. I see Master Jaucribaix is starting another project. Let me tell you where to find that item.${prompt}'
  10221: 'You won''t just find one lying around anywhere. Forging a katana is somewhat of a ritual. The smith focuses all his spiritual energy into the task. Thus, the ${item-singular: 0[2]} used must be from a spiritual place as well.${prompt}'
  10222: Beyond the Meriphataud Mountains is an ancient forest known as the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah. There you will find a tree that has been standing for over a thousand years.${prompt}
  10223: Only a branch from this tree is suitable for the flame that burns in Master Jaucribaix's furnace. However, take care when traveling in Zi'Tah, as it is a land of much mystery and danger.${prompt}
  10224: 'Here, take this ${item-singular: 1[2]}. You will know what to do with it when you arrive at the tree. Take care not to lose it, as it is a very rare item.${prompt}'
  10225: 'What? You need another ${item-singular: 1[2]}? And after I told you how important it was! If you want me to give you another one, bring me one ${item-singular: 2[2]} and two ${item-plural: 3[2]}, and I will think about it.${prompt}'
  10226: 'If you want me to give you another ${item-singular: 1[2]}, bring me one ${item-singular: 2[2]} and two ${item-plural: 3[2]}, and I will think about it.${prompt}'
  10227: I do not mean to sound rude, but this is a very important item. Do not go losing it again.${prompt}
  10228: 'Welcome back from your journey. Please deliver that ${item-singular: 0[2]} directly to Master Jaucribaix.${prompt}'
  10229: 'What does an adventurer like you need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} for? Oh, Master Jaucribaix sent you. Then I guess I have to give you this.${prompt}'
  10230: 'To the untrained eye, this ${item-singular: 1[2]} may look like a simple piece of scrap iron, but it is actually a rare ore from the Far East.${prompt}'
  10231: It contains metals not found on Mindartia or Quon. By processing this in a special way, it will become the perfect material for melting iron in the Master's furnace.${prompt}
  10232: 'Your job is to find a bomb to consume this ${item-singular: 1[2]}. When a bomb eats it, it will be refined into ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10233: 'Somewhere in the Konschtat Highlands is a small cave with a charred floor. It is there you will find a bomb that will consume the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'

  10237: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 1[2]} do not come cheap. I will give you a new one only in exchange for ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  10238: 'Ah, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}. Here is the ${item-singular: 1[2]} I promised, but you should really try to take better care of your belongings...${prompt}'
  10239: 'I see you made it back safely. I hope you didn''t have trouble with the bomb. The ${item-singular: 0[2]}? Oh, you can give that directly to Master Jaucribaix.${prompt}'
  10240: You do not have to worry about your reward. Master Jaucribaix is a man of his word. Time is necessary for him to complete his work.${prompt}
  10241: You must be patient. Nothing good can be gained by rushing things.${prompt}
  10242: You must not set any limits in your life, as your progress will end when you reach them. Always set your goals high, and you will continue to grow stronger.${prompt}
  10243: |-
    If ya ever have any problems with those pesky little Tonberries, just come to yer buddy Magephaud.
    It doesn't look like you're in that much trouble, though.${prompt}

    Heh-heh-heh...
    You've been out playin' with the Tonberries, haven't ya? Don't try denyin' it. I can tell jus' by lookin' at ya.${prompt}
  10245: I can see them Tonberries' hate fer ya. Now listen close, matey, if ya want t'live.${prompt}
  10246: The little green beasties on this island are all connected. When ya kill one, the others around all get stronger. It's their hate fer ya that drives 'em.${prompt}
  10247: But today's yer lucky day, me matey. I happen t'know a special way of appeasin' those Tonberries.${prompt}

  10250: 'One...two...three. Three ${item-plural: 0[2]}, just like I asked fer. Okay. Let me fill ya in on how to soothe these slimy savages.${prompt}'
  10251: Way back when I was still young and didn't know about the hate--the rancor--of the Tonberries, I killed a couple...just like you did.${prompt}
  10252: Then, one day when me and me mateys wuz plunderin' an old temple, I met an old Tonberry who understood the words of men.${prompt}
  10253: It was he who told me of the Tonberries' hate, and that only he could soothe the rancor heaped upon me.${prompt}
  10254: But then he told me t'fork over me gil! That be a beastman fer ya!${prompt}
  10255: So I told him t'show me some evidence before I was handin' over any gil, and with a wave of his wand, he relieved me of the Tonberries' rancor.${prompt}
  10256: And then, did I pay the gil? Of course I didn't! I hit him with a “Sneak Attack” and swiped his key t'the room. Then I used me “Flee” and I was gone like the wind.${prompt}
  10257: Ya get all that? Now ya know what t'do. Here's the key t'that room.${prompt}
  10258: Don't get the wrong idea, now. I only told ya I'd tell you the way t'rid yerself of the rancor, not actually rid ya of it.${prompt}
  10259: You've got the key. What ya do with it is up to you, but watch yer back if yer ever travelin' around that ancient temple.${prompt}
  10260: 'Well, shivivi me timbers! Dat ${item-singular: 0[2]} you''re carryin''! I''be seen dat before!${prompt}'
  10261: Me and my ninja mateys here in Norg worked day and night and night and day to come up wit' some new-fangled ninjutsu. But we made it a little too fangled...${prompt}

  10276: You know that the cave you used to get here is called the Sea Serpent Grotto, right? And you already know about those fishy-looking Sahagin that live down there, don't you?${prompt}
  10277: Well, I need you to go and get me something from their hidden vault. That's not too hard, is it? I mean, this is a matter of life or death! Life or death!${prompt}
  10278: Before the Sahagin took over, the pirates here used to use the grotto as a storage area. To protect their treasure from thieves...and themselves, they built numerous hidden doors.${prompt}
  10279: Recently the Sahagin have added tricks and traps to those doors, so you have to watch out. There's no way I could do it myself, but you? You can do it! I know you can!${prompt}
  10280: From what I heard, the treasure vault is not that deep in the grotto. All you have to do is go down there and bring me back something--anything! You're not going to back out on me, are you? Are you?${prompt}

  10318: Though even with the loss, he hasn't forgot the tricks of his trade. He's one of the best workers we have here.${prompt}
  10319: Get his memory back? I'd like to see that as much as the next guy. If only there was some way...${prompt}
  10320: When we pirates attack other ships, we call up the souls of those lost at sea to do our dirty work. It's a little bit different from the summoning magic you adventurers use.${prompt}
  10321: But don't ask me to explain how. I ain't no magician, you know.${prompt}

  10335: My name's Gabide. My adventures as a paladin have taken me all over Vana'diel, but I'd have to say this sea cave would have to top my list of amazing places.${prompt}
  10336: And to think that this is the hideout of the pirates who attacked me when I was still a young adventurer... But if it wasn't for that fateful day, I wouldn't be who I am now.${prompt}
  10337: When you think about it that way, I guess I can't get too angry about what happened.${prompt}
  10338: The volcano on this island, Mount Yuhtunga, is still active. They say that Elshimo was created when it erupted thousands of years ago.${prompt}
  10339: What, is the baby adventurer lost? I don't have time for babysittin' landlubbers like you. You got a brain--use it!${prompt}
  10340: We pirates call tha cave connectin' Norg t'tha mainland the “Sea Serpent Grotto.” Just like there be beastmen on tha continents, tha grotto has its share of slimy dwellers. Namely, tha Sahagin.${prompt}
  10341: And t'make things worse, those nasty little beasts have filled tha place up with trick doors so ya can't get t'tha deeper parts of the cave.${prompt}
  10342: We used t'have a vault down there, but nobody's been able t'get close to it fer years.${prompt}
  10343: For guys like us that live on the sea, you adventurers sure come in handy. You're our only source of info from the mainland.${prompt}

  10356: Unlike armor, the strength of a weapon depends solely on the skill of its owner. Just because one's blade is sharp doesn't mean one can wield it to its full potential.${prompt}
  10357: But an adventurer such as yourself would have already known that...${prompt}

  10386: Oh, and let me tell you. I'm not doing this for Ensetsu. I only care about Yomi's daughters...${prompt}
  10387: Arrrg, so you're the landlubbin' adventurer that they sent from Bastok.${prompt}
  10388: I'm a busy man, so let's cut with the chitchat and get right down to business.${prompt}
  10389: Lately, you adventurers are making quite a killin' on items, weapons, and the like. We knew that you were out there, but we didn't think you'd be givin' us this much competition.${prompt}
  10390: But rather than gettin' in each other's way, I thought that there might be a way we could work together. What I want ya t'do is give me an idea of what you adventurers are capable of.${prompt}

  10399: Gilgamesh. It was fine when you called me that when I was a child, but I'm twenty years old now.${prompt}
  10400: So, what brings ya t'these here parts? Come to check up on your adventurer?${prompt}
  10401: That is one of the reasons. We wouldn't want you snatching up one of Bastok's best.${prompt}
  10402: If I wanted to snatch up Bastok's best, I'd be snatching up the fine samurai standing in front of me. How about it, Ayaya? Leave that boring job of yours and join us!${prompt}
  10403: We'd love t'have you. You'd have the chance t'wield your blade whenever you please, not when that president says you can. Arrrg, what d'ya say?${prompt}
  10404: While I am flattered by your offer, I am satisfied with, and hold pride in, my current post.${prompt}
  10405: I realize that I still have much to learn, but at the same time I feel that I must travel the roads I see fit to travel.${prompt}

  10409: You may want to read over the details at a later time. You need not give an answer now. However, I trust that Norg will take steps in the right direction.${prompt}
  10410: Arrrg, ya don't leave much room fer choice now, do you?${prompt}

    Why do they so despise talking with us that they would rather fight?

    Hmmm...
    Hrmmm...
    So it's time to use...no...${prompt}
  10514: |-
    Hello?
    You're an adventurer, right?
    Maybe you can help us out.${prompt}
  10515: Let me introduce myself and my companion. We're from the Rhinostery in Windurst.${prompt}
  10516: 'I was hired by the ministry to accompany this researcher to ${choice: 2}[Ifrit''s Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei''Yin/the Boyahda Tree] and assist him in his study of a series of giant crystals.${prompt}'
  10517: But what was waiting for us inside those crystals was more than I could deal with...${prompt}
  10518: |-
    We tried countless times, but I could not defeat that beast.
    Another researcher at the Rhinostery sympathized with our plight and developed an improved tuning fork.${prompt}
  10519: |-
    No no no no no!
    That crazy-wazy contraption won't provide us with any useful data!${prompt}
  10520: |-
    Listen, muscle-hussle brain.
    Science is not about winning or spinning, life or strife, even or Steven! It's a more delicate subjectaru!${prompt}
  10521: Do you see what I have to deal with? I don't know how much longer I can work with such a pessimist.${prompt}
  10522: |-
    That's where you come in.
    I was thinking of letting one of you adventurers test out the new fork and prove to my colleague that it is able to return data valuable to his research.${prompt}
  10523: |-
    No no no no no!
    Even if they use that half-rate spork, it'll take a tip-top summoner to defeat the prime avatar!${prompt}
  10524: |-
    Listen up.
    The fandangled ${item-singular: 1[2]} won't make it any easier for you to downright defeat the monster inside the crystal. Sure, it'll lower the power of the prime avatar to around ${number: 3}, but it will do the same to you! And on top of that, you'll only be able to summon that itty-bitty blue bugger, Carbuncle!${prompt}
  10525: And to make things worse, nobody-buddy else can enter the crystal with you! You'll be battling one-on-one, man-to-man, Taru-et-Taru!${prompt}
  10526: |-
    ...
    Yes, but sir... The Rhinostery has been pressing us to produce results. If we do not take some sort of action quickly...${prompt}
  10527: |-
    Hmmm...
    You do have a point there...
    I guess one round with a prime avatar wouldn't hurtaru.${prompt}
  10528: No, one round could not hurt.${prompt}
  10529: |-
    You know that you probably won't gain anything from this battle-waddle.
    Are you sure you still want the fork?${prompt}
  10530: |-
    Are you really-dilly sure?
    ${selection-lines}
    Fork me!
    On second thought...${prompt}
  10531: |-
    Well, you asked for it!

  10637: |-
    Spoken like a true samurai. Now let me fill you in on the details.

  10646: 'Ah yes, your reward. Let me give you this ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. It is one of my finest works. May it guide you on your journey.${prompt}'
  10647: As I told you before, the materials you brought me will be used to forge a sacred katana to be used in an important ritual being held in a matter of days.${prompt}
  10648: However, there is still much preparation to be done. Your assistance may be required again.${prompt}
  10649: What is wrong? You do not look too well...${prompt}
  10650: I think I know what may be troubling you. You remember my pupil Ranemaud, do you not? Talk with him, and he may be able to help you with your predicament.${prompt}
  10651: 'This is all I will tell you. After you have obtained ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}, bring them and your ${item-singular: 0[2]} to me. I will be waiting.${prompt}'
  10652: Well, if it isn't my favorite adventurer. How is your training coming along? I can see that you have become quite the samurai.${prompt}

  10654: 'However, you need not worry. The one place where you can obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is here in Norg.${prompt}'
  10655: 'Like a salmon returns to its birthplace to die, all ${item-plural: 0[2]} that are disposed of by their owners make their way back here to Norg. The blade you disposed of is not an exception.${prompt}'
  10656: 'I do not know what reasons you had when disposing of your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, but the moment that blade left your possession, it became ours once again.${prompt}'
  10657: 'I can return it to you if you wish, but it will cost you. Pay me ${number: 7} gil, and I will give back to you what you once let slip through your hands.${prompt}'
  10658: 'The destiny that lies ahead of that ${item-singular: 0[2]} is much more important than you could ever imagine. Take care of it this time.${prompt}'
  10659: It looks like you are still a little short on gil.${prompt}
  10660: Ah, you're back! And just in time, I might say. The date of the ritual is approaching fast.${prompt}
  10661: 'For this next assignment, Gilgamesh specifically requested the assistance of the previous owner of the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10662: That is unfortunate, but there still is time. Please reconsider your decision.${prompt}
  10663: |-
    Excellent.
    Now let me show you into Gilgamesh's quarters.${prompt}
  10664: Arrrg, if it isn't me matey, ${name-player}. We be mighty grateful fer yer help 'n this one.${prompt}
  10665: I'm sure Jauc's already told ya 'bout the upcomin' ritual we be holdin'. We call it “Yomi Okuri.” In Far Eastern legend, Yomi is the name of the place where the spirits of the dead roam.${prompt}
  10666: Let me explain...${prompt}
  10667: Twenty years ago, before the fall of Castle Zvahl and the Shadow Lord, a small country was wiped off the face of Vana'diel by those bloodthirsty beastmen.${prompt}
  10668: That country was known as the Marquisate of Tavnazia. The flag we raise here in Norg be the flag of that lost nation.${prompt}
  10669: It was a gruesome battle. Citizens of Tavnazia, soldiers from the three nations... Nearly all were slaughtered in a matter of hours.${prompt}
  10670: |-
    I, too, saw the apocalypse that happened the day Tavnazia fell.
    When 'twas all over, the handful of us that remained escaped on a tiny ship.${prompt}
  10671: But most of me mateys were already in bad shape and didn't survive the long journey home. Only a few of us made it back to Valkurm alive.${prompt}
  10672: When we arrived at the dunes, we found that there were others that had tried escapin', but failed...the wreckage of their ships scattered 'bout the beaches.${prompt}
  10673: Those who could still move used what remained of their energy to dig simple graves for those that had passed. But this would not be enough to appease the troubled souls that lingered in those sands.${prompt}
  10674: Without a guidin' hand, the souls remain in this world, gettin' angrier an' angrier. The Yomi Okuri ritual is held to show these lost spirits the way t'their proper place of restin'.${prompt}
  10675: Jauc, you take it from here.${prompt}
  10676: Yes, sir.${prompt}
  10677: 'For the Yomi Okuri to be properly carried out, a sacred katana must be made. Your ${item-singular: 0[2]} has already been used to forge the blade of the katana. However, we are still one step away from completion.${prompt}'
  10678: 'Somewhere on the mainlands is a place called the Labyrinth of Onzozo. In those caves lurks a mammoth bird. To complete the sacred katana, I require ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} from that beast.${prompt}'
  10679: However, this bird rarely ever sets forth from its nest. It must be lured out with a special kind of bait.${prompt}
  10680: An' the only one of me mates that can brew a bait fine enough to make that pecker show its beak would be our head cook, Washu. Get some from her before ya leave.${prompt}

  10688: |-
    Welcome back, ${name-player}.
    The new form that blade has taken is the proof that you were successful in your mission. I applaud you on your bravery.${prompt}
  10689: Gilgamesh has asked me to present you with this as a token of our appreciation. Wear it with pride and let it guide you on your path in life.${prompt}
  10690: |-
    Norg has many ties with the lost nation of Tavnazia, and many people here still think of it as their homeland.
    The battle fought twenty years ago took the lives of many of our brothers, but the sacrifices that they made have not been in vain.${prompt}
  10691: That day, something in Gilgamesh changed. He transformed from a simple soldier to a great leader who would bring us together and create the Norg of today.${prompt}
  10692: So you're the adventurer that Gilgamesh sent, eh? Get out a piece of paper and a pencil. You're going to have to go fetch me the following four items.${prompt}
  10693: |-
    What? You thought I'd have everything you need here? With the way these hooligans eat, I barely have enough grub to feed the dogs!
    Oh, don't worry. The way you adventurers put everything up on auction, you should be able to get your hands on these items easy enough.${prompt}
  10694: 'All I need is ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}'
  10695: When you've got all four, bring them to me. I'll whip you up your bait in no time.${prompt}
  10696: What, did you forget what I need you to bring already? And you call yourself an adventurer!${prompt}
  10697: Well, that was quick. Pretty good for an adventurer. There may be some hope for you yet! Ha ha ha!${prompt}
  10698: Now, let me whip up your bird bait, just like I promised.${prompt}
  10699: |-
    Here you go.
    Be careful, though. From what I hear, that Onzozo place is a lot rougher than our jungles.${prompt}
  10700: Why are you still here? You've got to get my bait to the birdy before it goes bad. If you were a monster, would you settle for a spoiled meal?${prompt}
  10701: ${name-player}! Once again, trouble is brewing in Norg, and we require your services.${prompt}
  10702: |-
    I see. So you are busy...
    However, there is still time. I pray that you will return to us quickly.${prompt}
  10703: Your gratitude is appreciated by all of us here in Norg. Now let us proceed to Gilgamesh's chambers.${prompt}
  10704: |-
    Arrrg, welcome back, ${name-player}.
    Let me fill ya in on the predicament we've got ourselves into.${prompt}
  10705: |-
    A thief's robbed us of one of our treasures.
    Me thinks it be another band o'pirates. I've got me men out on the trail of 'em now.${prompt}
  10706: Ya may think that problems between pirates should be solved by pirates--and yer right. But this time, the situation's a wee bit more complicated.${prompt}
  10707: 'The item the thief stole was an ancient helmet left by me ancestors called ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. But this ain''t no ordinary helmet.${prompt}'
  10708: It's said that me father trapped the spirit of an evil demon in that helmet after a grueling battle in the Northlands. He put numerous magical seals on it t'keep the beast at bay.${prompt}
  10709: This probably be the reason that our rival pirates decided t'lay their grimy hands on it.${prompt}
  10710: T'make a long story short, I need ya t'find the man that had the nerve t'rob me, and get that helmet back. Not too difficult fer an adventurer like you, eh?${prompt}
  10711: And if fer some reason, the magic seal on the helmet were to be broken, we'll need ya t'...well, ya know what we'll need ya t'do then.${prompt}
  10712: Because of the sensitive nature of this problem, not many here in Norg have been informed of what has happened. However, the men I have sent to track down the thieves should have some good information fer ya, but first ya have t'search them out.${prompt}
  10713: Currently, Gilgamesh has men combing Vana'diel for clues on the whereabouts of the thieves. Search them out and learn what new information they have gathered.${prompt}
  10714: The situation has grown graver than I had imagined. It is only a matter of time before the seal on the helmet breaks, if it has not already.${prompt}
  10715: Take this. It can be used to extinguish the evil spirit's power for a short period of time.${prompt}
  10716: 'Throw that ${item-singular: 0[2]} into the magic portal. After that, you should then be able to enter. But beware of what lurks on the other side!${prompt}'
  10717: You fool! How could you just dispose of such an important item? Without it, how are you supposed to break the cursed seal on the portal!?${prompt}
  10718: 'By the looks of this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, I can guess that seal was already broken when you arrived at the shrine. It is amazing that the seal held for so many decades.${prompt}'
  10719: You have done well, ${name-player}. Without your strength and perseverance, we would not have been able to silence that evil spirit. We are all in your debt.${prompt}
  10720: |-
    However, before I give you your reward, there is one more small task that I wish of you.
    It would be an abomination to leave the helmet in this damaged state. We must do something to repair it.${prompt}
  10721: 'Hmmm... We have most of the material required to repair it here in Norg, but I fear we may not have enough ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  10722: 'Bring me one ${item-singular: 1[2]}. I am sure you know of a craftsman who can provide you with this material. I will proceed in repairing the helmet when you have brought it to me.${prompt}'
  10723: 'The helmet is in terrible condition. However, I think that with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, I may be able to repair it.${prompt}'
  10724: Yes, this is what I require to repair the damaged helmet. I will get to work immediately. However, this may take a great deal of time. Its condition is far worse than I had imagined.${prompt}
  10725: Why must you rush me in my work!? As I told you, the helmet was in terrible condition when you brought it to me. My work must be precise if I am to return it to its former glory!${prompt}
  10726: 'Ah, ${name-player}. I have just finished the repairs to the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. I had to replace a large part of the helmet, but I feel I have helped it retain its former luster.${prompt}'
  10727: |-
    Yes, your reward. I have not forgotten.
    Let us discuss these matters in Gilgamesh's quarters.${prompt}
  10728: Arrrg, I'm sorry fer gettin' ya caught up in our pirate affairs, but I be mighty glad t'see ya back here safe in Norrrg.${prompt}
  10729: You have me thanks fer all ya done for us.${prompt}
  10730: If it weren't fer ya, we'd still be fearin' the day that demon would rear its ugly head 'n eat us all. But now that the demon's gone, that just leaves a pretty helmet t'sit on me wall.${prompt}
  10731: 'But what good is a helmet without a head t''wear it!? This ${item-singular: 0[2]} would do you more good than it would collectin'' dust in me chambers. Take it! You''ve earned it!${prompt}'
  10732: 'I am still taken back by how much you''ve matured much since I forged your ${item-singular: 0[2]} many moons ago. I can only imagine what great things lie before such a skilled warrior.${prompt}'
  10733: So, you've decided to help!${prompt}
  10734: So, you've finally decided to help.${prompt}

  10748: Why all this trouble over a cat? Well, when that lady was here, she tried sellin' us a strange crystal she said she found in the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah.${prompt}
  10749: I don't think she was tryin' t'pull a fast one, but no one was interested in her booty, so she packed up and left fer somewhere else.${prompt}
  10750: But now that me thinks of it, that crystal she found in Zi'Tah may be jus' what we're lookin' fer.${prompt}
  10751: A thief like her won't be easy t'find. I'll have me mateys around Vana'diel spread the word that yer lookin' fer a crystal like the one she has.${prompt}

  10755: Arrrg, so were ya able t'make it t'Tu'Lia?${prompt}
  10756: Oh, so ya made them Crystal Warriors walk the plank now, did ya? Then that jus' leaves us with that wee prince. But first, we've got t'find a way into the darn shrine.${prompt}
  10757: Is it Eald'narrrche that's keepin' us out, or is it somethin' else?${prompt}
  10758: Listen close, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10759: If the prince had already opened the Gate of the Gods, Vana'diel wouldn't be here anymore. But as you can see, nothin's changed so far.${prompt}
  10760: Which means all we can do is wait. When Eald'narche makes his move...that's when we attack!${prompt}
  10761: You'n me both hate the Zilarrrt makin' fools out of us, but there's nothing much we can do right now.${prompt}
  10762: We can't know when Eald'narche will attempt t'open the gate. It could be t'morrow, fer all I know. If ya have any preparations, I'd suggest makin' 'em now.${prompt}

  10766: One play is 100 gil, but as long as you keep paying, you can keep playing.${prompt}
  10767: For each 100 gil, you get one roll of our six-sided die. The number that appears is added to the running total for that day.${prompt}

  10770: But be careful; the only time you can find out the running total is after you have rolled.${prompt}
  10771: |-
    And that's it! Pretty simple, huh?

  10795: And when me father told me I was t'take care of her...well, I can tell ya, I wasn't ready fer that.${prompt}

    However, there is no need to fear. I have another ${item-singular: 0[2]} that I can lend you, though you must start the trial once again from the beginning.

  10825: You've learned to wield your katana by risking your life and limb out there on the battlefield.${prompt}
  10826: Learning this final technique will be no different. You'll have to get out there in the jungle and bust your butt like you never have before. Do you think you've got what it takes?${prompt}
  10827: Hah! You may be shaking your head now, but I know your type. You won't be satisfied until you reach the top. You'll be back...and I'll be waiting.${prompt}
  10828: I knew that you couldn't resist the challenge, but saying you're going to do something is a helluva lot easier than actually going out and doing it. If you don't think you're going to succeed, then you shouldn't even bother trying in the first place!${prompt}

    Very well, I will pass it on to you.

  11006: |-
    Every time ${item-singular: 0[2]} is reborn it gains a new wielder, who ultimately must pass it on to a successor.
    I have swung this hammer for more than eight hundred years. I never wished to part with it.${prompt}
  11007: "However, there is little meaning in me keeping it now. \nIf you will wield this weapon for a just cause, I hand its power over to you.${prompt}"

    Well, it's for the best, I suppose.
    In my current state, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is nothing more than an ornament, its power going to waste.${prompt}

    You are now the one to draw me in battle.
    I will be at your side on any road you choose to travel, along with the destructive power of my arrows.${prompt}
  11034: |-
    ...
    We finally meet.${prompt}
  11035: I am now free from the pit of Dynamis to spit fire in this world once again.${prompt}
  11036: But I must ask you to wait before taking me into your possession...${prompt}
  11037: |-
    Why'd you have to go and wake me up? I was having the most relaxing sleep.
    Oh, this place looks familiar...${prompt}
  11038: Hm? You think you're the one who's going to take up my gun?${prompt}
  11039: 'You do seem to have a fair eye for marksmanship. And ${item-singular: 0[2]} would look perfect nestled in the crook of your arm...${prompt}'
  11040: Well, I have no more use for this weapon, so I guess you can have it. But there is one thing I want you to remember.${prompt}
  11041: This gun is a fearsome weapon that unleashes a blast upon your enemies many thousands of times greater in strength than the tiny effort it takes you to pull the trigger. Needless to say, be careful who you aim it at...${prompt}
  11042: '...${prompt}'
  11043: A weapon has no will of its own. But it was made for a purpose.${prompt}
  11044: Take me to a new battlefield, a new arena for the hunt...${prompt}
  11045: |-
    ...
    I am saved.${prompt}
  11046: Silenced for too long in the prison of Dynamis, I can once again let my brazen call echo through this land!${prompt}
  11047: A few more moments, if you please...${prompt}
  11048: |-
    Hello there.
    I am Terounalivet, a military musician of the Hydra Corps.${prompt}
  11049: |-
    You've never heard of me?
    Before joining the army I was quite the famous bard, mobbed by fans in every town I passed through.${prompt}
  11050: 'To be completely truthful, I am heartbroken to be giving up the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the most famous of instruments, even to a fellow bard.${prompt}'
  11051: But an instrument only shows its true worth when being played. This horn should be delighted to be passed on to such a talent as yourself.${prompt}
  11052: She has a capricious soul, but do treat her well. And do not forget that even without a raging battle, you can still play a tune for the simple enjoyment of those around you...${prompt}
  11053: '...${prompt}'
  11054: He was a wonderful performer.${prompt}
  11055: |-
    Let us be on our way.
    Our tour of the world has only just begun...${prompt}
  11056: |-
    You wanna talk to old Kamui?
    He doesn't have time to swap fishin' tales with every adventurer that wanders in from the jungle. Take a number, buddy.${prompt}
  11057: |-
    You wanna talk with old Kamui?
    I've got orders that he's not to be disturbed.
    Come back some other time.${prompt}
  11058: |-
    How'd you know to bring somethin' like this?
    Old Kamui just loves spicy foods.${prompt}
  11059: |-
    Wait here.
    I'll go get him for you.${prompt}
  11060: '${name-player}, good vork on obtaining the ${item-singular: 1[2]} and the other foods.${prompt}'
  11061: I vill listen to vhat this Kamui has to say along vith you.${prompt}
  11062: |-
    Sorry to keep you waiting.
    I was informed you brought me some tasty gifts.${prompt}
  11063: How did you come by these items? You must be involved in the Tavnazian affairs that Gilgamesh mentioned.${prompt}
  11064: |-
    In which case, I will give you my full cooperation.
    Tavnazia is my homeland. We lived in the Marquisate when Lugalbanda was our leader.${prompt}
  11065: |-
    You are from Tavnazia?
    Ve have come here from Kazham after consulting vith the former chieftainness, Romaa Mihgo.${prompt}
  11066: |-
    Ve vish to hear the tale about a glowing box.
    The chieftainness said that you mightaru know of such a story.${prompt}
  11067: You speak of the treasure of Tavnazia--the “baptismal vessel”?${prompt}
  11068: Do you, too, seek the power of the magicite...?${prompt}
  11069: |-
    Magicite?
    No, ve did not come to ask about that cursed-vursed rock.${prompt}
  11070: |-
    Ve are looking for a crystal of darkness said to lie somevhere in the Northlands.
    Do you know anything of this legend?${prompt}
  11071: |-
    A crystal of darkness...
    This must be related to the tale of a soldier who found the baptismal vessel in those frozen lands.${prompt}
  11072: The story takes place in the time when King Ranperre ruled the Kingdom of San d'Oria...${prompt}
  11073: A horde of Orcs once sailed from the northern continent to attempt a landing on Quon.${prompt}
  11074: The Uleguerand Range, north of Xarcabard, would become the staging point for the Orcish campaign.${prompt}
  11075: To halt this invasion, the Tavnazian navy took to the seas while King Ranperre led an army overland...${prompt}
  11076: The snowy plains ran red with uncounted bloody skirmishes fought in the defense of Quon.${prompt}
  11077: In the midst of the vicious battle, a San d'Orian soldier slipped and fell into a crevasse.${prompt}
  11078: As he wandered in search of an exit from the winding tunnels, the soldier noticed an ephemeral voice calling to him.${prompt}
  11079: The soldier began walking in the direction of the voice, and eventually stumbled upon an unexpected sight. Right before him lay a frozen lake, glowing with an eerie light...${prompt}
  11080: And then vhat happened?${prompt}
  11081: It is said that the soldier was addressed by the voice of a god, but none know of the words that passed between them.${prompt}
  11082: The story ends with the soldier returning from the Northlands bearing a mysterious box. This box was to become a holy relic of the Tavnazian Cathedral.${prompt}
  11083: A frozen lake in the Uleguerand Range, beyond the land of Xarcabard...${prompt}
  11084: |-
    Now that I think about it, thirty years ago there was a Mithra who went in search of the lake after hearing this tale.
    She was unsuccessful.${prompt}
  11085: Apparently she joined an allied expedition for her journey to the Northlands...${prompt}
  11086: Yow Rabntah vas looking for the frozen lake!?${prompt}
  11087: Yes, but her experiences in that evil land twisted her soul.${prompt}
  11088: Her return to Kazham sparked an intertribal conflict that cost many Mithra their lives.${prompt}
  11089: |-
    After this incident, Romaa Mihgo became chieftainness, and her rule caused other problems between Kazham and Norg.
    But looking back, that was probably unavoidable.${prompt}
  11090: Ah, I've veered from our original discussion.${prompt}
  11091: |-
    No, not at all.
    This has been mostaru informative, thank you.${prompt}
  11092: According to Kamui's story, Yow Rabntah joined the allied expedition of her own free vill.${prompt}
  11093: Vas Romaa Mihgo not avare of this fact?${prompt}
  11094: |-
    Hmm.
    The Uleguerand Range is not a place to visitaru lightly.${prompt}
  11095: Let us call upon the Rhinostery adventurers in the Northlands for help!${prompt}
  11096: |-
    ${name-player}, meet me at the tower on the Beaucedine Glacier vhere my Rhinostery peers are located.
    Until then!${prompt}
  11097: That Tarutaru you came with, he's an adventurer for the Rhinostery, right?${prompt}
  11098: |-
    He said somethin' about visiting a tower in Beaucedine.
    If they're lookin' to research the treasure that's supposed to be there, they're wastin' their time. It was stolen and sold off years ago.${prompt}
  11099: mes1${prompt}
  11100: Hey, look, it's a stinkin' adventurer!${prompt}
  11101: We're busy toastin' the end of a hard day's work, so why don't ya buzz off someplace?${prompt}
  11102: I bet ya never seen the likes o' this brew, have ya?${prompt}
  11103: This drop, matey, can only be found in the mysterious lands o' the Far East.${prompt}
  11104: |-
    Listen here, ${choice: 0}[lass/landlubber].
    We pirates got a powerful hate for so-called “heroes” like you.${prompt}
  11105: Anyone who's never braved the high seas fer battle and booty is still just a whimpering puppy to a pirate.${prompt}
  11106: |-
    Oho, so's ya got something to say about that, have ya?
    A challenge, then. If ya can bring a treasure ta brighten a pirate's jaded eye, then ya might find a seat at our table.${prompt}
  11107: Arrgh, not that we're expectin' much from a whelp like you!${prompt}
  11108: |-
    Sohyon used to have one of them talkin' birds that perched on his shoulder.
    Maybe ya could get us one of those?${prompt}
  11109: "Or maybe ya could grow yerself a bushy red beard. \nThat'd impress me.${prompt}"
  11110: |-
    Ahahaha!
    That might be askin' a bit too much, eh?${prompt}
  11111: |-
    I tell ya what.
    If ya can bring a drink that warms me pirate's soul, I'll give ya one of whatever there is to be found in Norg.${prompt}
  11112: Arrgh, now there's a deal!${prompt}
  11113: How about introducin' him to that young lass that wandered in a little while back?${prompt}
  11114: |-
    Hold on there, ya mangy backstabber!
    I had me eye on that one!${prompt}
  11115: How about introducin' her to one o' the pair that wandered in a little while back?${prompt}
  11116: Yeah, that ought to keep her outta our hair.${prompt}
  11117: Just remember, I saw the other one first.${prompt}
  11118: |-
    Enough blathering, ya scurvy dogs.
    Ya know what ya have ta do, adventurer.${prompt}
  11119: |-
    I'll be waitin' right here with me empty cup.
    Heh-heh-heh.${prompt}
  11120: |-
    Sohyon's drunk pretty much all there is to drink.
    Good luck findin' somethin' to satisfy 'im.${prompt}
  11121: Arrgh, let's see what yer made of, adventurer.${prompt}
  11122: Me cup's still empty, adventurer.${prompt}
  11123: |-
    Those boys ain't gonna be satisfied, no matter what you bring.
    Yer better off just goin' on yer way.${prompt}
  11124: Here, take this flask.${prompt}
  11125: |-
    Fill it from the four big clams in the Korroloka Tunnel.
    We'll see who has the last laugh...${prompt}
  11126: Good work. Now hand it over to Sohyon.${prompt}
  11127: |-
    Arrgh, ya kept me waitin' fer long enough.
    Here's ta ya health!${prompt}
  11128: |-
    Urgh!
    This is plain water! What kinda dirty trick are ya tryin' ta pull?${prompt}
  11129: You've poured so many liquids down your throat, you probably can't tell a fine beverage from barrel swill anymore.${prompt}
  11130: Wash your mouth out with that and give yourself a break for a while!${prompt}
  11131: |-
    Are ya tryin' to tell me how ta drink?
    I don't need yer stinkin' advice!${prompt}
  11132: Your tongue must be rotten, Sohyon.${prompt}
  11133: That liquid is the most refreshing, revitalizing water in Vana'diel.${prompt}
  11134: It comes from the giant clams in the Korroloka Tunnel. If you spent a moment savoring the taste, you'd realize it's more than just ordinary water.${prompt}
  11135: '...${prompt}'
  11136: Well, I guess ya kept yer end of the bargain.${prompt}
  11137: Take this key to Gimb, the Galka who stands near the entry gate. He'll take care o' ya.${prompt}
  11138: |-
    Get outta here.
    I got no time fer scabby adventurers.${prompt}
  11139: 'Yer here to meet the ${choice: 0}[lad/lass] from the couple that blew in a while back?${prompt}'
  11140: Hang around here a bit.${prompt}
  11141: |-
    Hmmm.
    I can't find the girl.
    Where could she have gone?${prompt}
  11142: |-
    Thank you for coming!
    You're a life saver, kupopo!${prompt}
  11143: |-
    Just a moment, now.
    Where's that dreamy-looking girl got to?${prompt}
  11144: Sanctia? Oh, she left ages and ages ago, kupopo.${prompt}
  11145: 'I gave her some ${item-plural: 1[2]} and she let me have her dinner, kupopo.${prompt}'
  11146: Sanctia dreams of becoming a fearsome bounty hunter, kupopo!${prompt}
  11147: |-
    Hold on there, buddy.
    Does she really mean to find Goldmane, the legendary bounty hunter?${prompt}
  11148: He's the guy that collared the infamous Atarefaunet.${prompt}
  11149: I heard he scored a mountain of gil for that job, but the rest of Atarefaunet's Band is still thirsting for his blood.${prompt}
  11150: The rumors say Goldmane went into hiding after the gang came after him.${prompt}
  11151: Yeah, and if he's still breathing, it means those vicious thugs haven't found him yet.${prompt}
  11152: A guy who can give that lot the runaround is never gonna be found by a clueless puppy like Sanctia.${prompt}
  11153: And if her search for Goldmane becomes noticeable, it will draw the attention of Atarefaunet's Band.${prompt}
  11154: The idea was to make her cool her heels in Norg for a while, and then have Gilgamesh explain the big holes in her plan.${prompt}
  11155: But this is terrible, kupopo!${prompt}
  11156: Sanctia said she was going to Bastok, kupopo!${prompt}
  11157: Don't tell me she stowed away on the ship headed for Bastok?${prompt}
  11158: Captain Chieka is known among pirates as the “She-Devil of the Sea.”${prompt}
  11159: If Chieka finds her, Sanctia'll be tossed into the ocean for sure.${prompt}
  11160: We can't let that happen, kupopo!${prompt}
  11161: |-
    Wha-! Dammit!
    There goes the other one!${prompt}
  11162: |-
    Jus' seein' yer ugly mug makes me brew go sour.
    Ya done what ya come to do, now clear off!${prompt}
  11163: |-
    Even Sohyon can't win against the likes o' Washu.
    They didn't put her in charge o' Norg's galley fer nothing.${prompt}
  11164: |-
    Getting on Washu's bad side is more trouble than it's worth.
    You'd do well to remember that, adventurer.${prompt}
  11165: |-
    Where could 'e be...?
    Knowing him, 'e should be...${prompt}
  11166: Oh, sorry there. Just talkin' to meself.${prompt}
  11167: '......${prompt}'
  11168: |-
    That rat...
    Where could he 'ave gotten off to...?${prompt}
  11169: |-
    I've got me a bad feeling about this...
    It brings back unpleasant memories, it does...${prompt}
  11170: |-
    ...Eh? You say you're an adventurer, do ya?
    Say, could I take a bit o' your time?
    I've got me a slight problem, you see.${prompt}
  11171: My mate Gubokka's gone down by 'imself to the Sea Serpent Grotto.${prompt}
  11172: We've always capered around that place like a blinkin' playground, so he shouldn't be gettin' himself lost.${prompt}
  11173: I haven't seen the little git's face once since his decidin' t' set off.${prompt}
  11174: Lately the people of Norg're up in arms due to all the monsters showin' up in the grotto.${prompt}
  11175: I told that nitwit Gubokka t' be careful, but still...${prompt}
  11176: I wanna go and check on the poor runt, but goin' alone into that monster-infested hole is just askin' for more trouble.${prompt}
  11177: |-
    That's where you come in.
    Think ya could go t' Sea Serpent Grotto and find Gubokka for me?${prompt}
  11178: I really need yer 'elp.${prompt}
  11179: |-
    You'll do it!?
    Why, thank ya! O' course, you'll be rewarded as handsomely as I can do for ya.${prompt}
  11180: |-
    Anyway, just keep a sharp eye out down there.
    I'd be in a real pickle if I lost the both of ya t' some grim fate.${prompt}
  11181: I've heard the monsters out there are no laughin' matter, so please be takin' care of yerself.${prompt}
  11182: |-
    ...<pant>...<gasp>...
    ...I...I'm...safe...?${prompt}
  11183: '...<pant>...<wheeze>...whew.${prompt}'
  11184: Gubokka!!!${prompt}
  11185: |-
    Stray Cloud!
    I...I'm sorry. I...${prompt}
  11186: |-
    Bloody hell! You okay!?
    What in blazes happened out there? Can ya speak?${prompt}
  11187: |-
    ...I...I'm fine.
    <gasp>...<pant>...${prompt}
  11188: Stray Cloud...I'm sure you know how everyone's worried about the beasts that have been appearing in the grotto lately...${prompt}
  11189: I thought I could do something about it... That's why I left. I wanted to defeat the monsters for the people of Norg.${prompt}
  11190: But I ended up lost in the caves that I'd walked through for years. Pathetic, I know.${prompt}
  11191: Swallowing my pride, I turned back and desperately began my search for the way home...${prompt}
  11192: '...That was when it happened.${prompt}'
  11193: All of a sudden, a monster jumped out from the shadows and began attacking me.${prompt}
  11194: It was unbelievably powerful. I knew I was no match for it.${prompt}
  11195: Next thing I knew, my legs had grown numb with fright...${prompt}
  11196: Suddenly, he had me cornered...${prompt}
  11197: My life began flashing before my eyes. I knew I was going to die.${prompt}
  11198: Just as I was regretting my decision to travel alone, a Hume warrior leapt out of nowhere and...saved me.${prompt}
  11199: |-
    You all right there!?
    Leave this brute to me!${prompt}
  11200: |-
    Come and get it, you bastard!
    Ahhhh!!!${prompt}
  11201: '...Ahh...!!!${prompt}'
  11202: |-
    I was so afraid, I deserted the Hume who had saved me.
    I...came back alone, thinking only of my own skin.${prompt}
  11203: |-
    W-wha'...!?
    So th' Hume's still out there?${prompt}
  11204: |-
    I don't know.
    I really hope he's okay, but considering the strength of that monster, I just don't know...${prompt}
  11205: What a bloody mess...${prompt}
  11206: |-
    I just...just wanted to help people.
    I couldn't have dreamed that this would happen...${prompt}
  11207: |-
    Ya know, Gubokka, thinkin' o' others is very noble.
    There's no denyin' that. But you just gotta stop pushin' it!${prompt}
  11208: |-
    Long ago, I had a good friend.
    He always blathered on about do-gooding and such, and to what did i' lead 'im? To a meaningless death, that's what!${prompt}
  11209: I couldn't stand losin' me another friend that way.${prompt}
  11210: Stray Cloud...${prompt}
  11211: |-
    Don't ge' any more rarab-brained ideas about goin' off alone.
    That's all I wanna say t' ya.${prompt}
  11212: Still, I'm worried about tha' Hume warrior...${prompt}
  11213: If he's killed because I was too cowardly to help him...${prompt}
  11214: |-
    ...
    I'm sorry, but I have to go back and help him!
    He might die if I don't!${prompt}
  11215: |-
    You git! Don't make me repeat myself!
    What can you blinkin' do out there alone?
    Just shut the 'ell up!${prompt}
  11216: B-but...${prompt}
  11217: |-
    Hey adventurer, you look like you've been through a battle or two.
    Since you didn't ge' a chance to look for Gubokka, could ya look for tha' Hume instead?${prompt}
  11218: I want ya t' go t' Sea Serpent Grotto with Gubokka and make sure he's safe!${prompt}
  11219: |-
    I'll be waitin' here for ya.
    O' course, you'll ge' a nice li'l reward.
    Jus' don't push yourself too hard.${prompt}
  11220: |-
    I leave Gubokka in your hands.
    I wonder if tha' Hume warrior is safe...?${prompt}
  11221: |-
    So that's what 'appened...
    Wha' an unfortunate loss...${prompt}
  11222: |-
    If only I had more power...
    I could have saved him!${prompt}
  11223: |-
    You can keep feelin' sorry for yourself if ya think it'll solve anything.
    But the proper thing for ya t' be doin' now is givin' the man a proper funeral.
    ...What's that you've go' there?${prompt}
  11224: |-
    This is the sword that the Hume warrior held...
    His final wish was that it be buried with his bones.${prompt}
  11225: Th-that sword...!${prompt}
  11226: I guess I can't be stoppin' ya now, can I?${prompt}
  11227: |-
    I have to go.
    I can use my strength for the good of others in Vana'diel.
    I've already made my decision.${prompt}
  11228: |-
    Heh... Is tha' so?
    Alrigh' then. I won't get in yer way.
    Hey, take this sword with ya. I'll let ya borrow it.${prompt}
  11229: |-
    Ohhh...really!?
    But isn't this sword important to you?${prompt}
  11230: |-
    Nah...it's fine.
    In exchange, you've gotta promise me somethin'.${prompt}
  11231: |-
    That sword is bloody powerful, so when you're helping the poor people o' Vana'diel, make good use of it!
    I'm sure you'll get t' use it for a good cause someday!${prompt}
  11232: |-
    Haha! That sounds like something you would say, putting me on the spot!
    But I hear you. I will keep the promise.${prompt}
  11233: And when I've fulfilled the promise, I'll come back and return the sword! Mark my word!${prompt}
  11234: |-
    I'll be waiting!
    But do ya think you'll really remember?
    Your memory's so bad, I'm surprised ya still know my name!${prompt}
  11235: |-
    Son of a Quadav...!
    With friends like you, who needs enemies!?${prompt}
  11236: Hahahahaha!!!${prompt}
  11237: Hahahahaha!!!${prompt}
  11238: But Gomoya never came t' return the sword...${prompt}
  11239: |-
    I can't believe it...
    Gomoya... For that Hume warrior, he...${prompt}
  11240: |-
    It...it can't be...
    Stray Cloud... The friend you were talking about...${prompt}
  11241: |-
    Heh. That nitwit Gomoya...
    He kept 'is promise...our promise...${prompt}
  11242: Ah...the lunkhead, making me eyes water!${prompt}
  11243: |-
    But, he's no longer...
    Gomoya is already...
    It looks like this is gonna be a long night...${prompt}
  11244: |-
    You 'elped me out a considerable lot.
    Here's your reward. Thanks be to ya.${prompt}
  11245: |-
    I was able to ge' closure with Gomoya, and it's all thanks t' you.
    I just wanna tell ya how much I appreciate it.${prompt}
  11246: |-
    Arrg, be good to see ya!
    So you and yer friends were the landlubbers what saved her, eh?${prompt}
  11247: Don't ya worry none, she be sleepin' it off like a sailor that's too fond of Opo-opo brew. The whole ordeal's left me girl a bit under the weather, but she'll pull through.${prompt}

  11257: Don't make much sense to me, but I be guessin' you know the truth of it. If ya ever need an old pirate's help, ya just let me know.${prompt}
  11258: Fer a girl what's saved the world, it be an endearin' thing fer her to be afraid of her dreams.${prompt}
  11259: Blimey. Are ya tryin' t'tell me that the savior of the world can't make up ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] mind about a simple thing like this? Guess some things never change, eh?${prompt}

    Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo!
    Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?${prompt}

    Do something, kupo?

    Porter service?
    Buy a storage slip.
    No, thank you.${prompt}

    Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over?
    Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.${prompt}
  11270: |-
    That's where I come in, kupo.
    I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.${prompt}
  11271: 'To make use of my services, first you''ll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of ${number: 19} gil.${prompt}'
  11272: Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt}
  11273: You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt}
  11274: Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt}
  11275: |-
    Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.
    I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt}
  11276: |-
    Invisible to you, at least.
    It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt}
  11277: When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt}
  11278: |-
    I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.
    Simple as that, kupo!${prompt}

    What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!
    Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt}
  11280: |-
    Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.
    So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt}
  11281: For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt}
  11282: |-
    Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!
    It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt}
  11283: Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt}
  11284: |-
    If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!
    No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”
    Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt}
  11285: Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt}
  11286: If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt}
  11287: |-
    And that's all there is to it.

    The official line is that the Grand Duchy of Jeuno oversees the whole organization, with local branches in each of the three nations.
    But any sailor worth 'is salt should already know that; elsewise, I'd suggest pullin' the kelp outcha ears an' payin' attention!${prompt}

    Anyway, protecting multiple nations is difficult. Yer ceaselessly runnin' long n' lonely border patrols lest a sudden squall blow yer hard-won peace clean to flinders.

    Just like the old adage asserts, ignorance truly is bliss.

  11327: |-
    Course this means bein' as black-'earted an' cold as th' void from which these abominations strike.
    And since so few know of our existence, we can go about our business in our own fashion. We need not concern ourselves with the political quagmire people call “diplomacy.”${prompt}

  11337: |-
    Other adventurers have enlisted with us, most of them so strong they could eviscerate the likes of ya with a fingernail. Any one of them should make a fine companion. As much as I would love to prove my strength to ya on the battlefield, us officers are tasked only with supplyin' the locations and names of yer targets. So there.
    Oh, and ya better show some initiative from start to finish, or ya won't be gettin' anythin' from the pyxides.${prompt}
  11338: I hear the rewards for completin' these tasks are quite the treasures, too. Should ya happen to chance upon some courage within that craven heart of yours, ya may also fight alone and save them all for y'self.${prompt}

  11344: |-
    Also, my directives involve only the cloak-and-dagger aspects of this trade. I find no reason to concern myself with the mundane particulars of our operations.
    Should ya wish to risk having yer ears jabbered off over such banalities, go see a Voidwatch Officer.${prompt}
  11345: |-
    Ah, there ya are.
    I heard about yer exploits in Kazham and Rabao. Maybe I misjudged you...${prompt}

    But don't assume ya've earned our trust after two measly missions.
    Come back when yer a bit more seasoned, then I might have something for ya.${prompt}

  11348: Think yer a better judge of yer own abilities than the boss, eh?${prompt}
  11349: Then try finding a better way to grab the boss's attention.${prompt}

    As for how to make him take notice, that half-rotten melon of yours should be able to figure it out.
    Best of luck to ya. Looks like you'll need it.${prompt}

  12355: Then how'd ya get here?${prompt}
  12356: I come from an age far in the future, when Vana'diel stands on a precipice--and the master is the only one who can guide me.${prompt}
  12357: So you mean to say that ${name-player}...is this master of yours?${prompt}
  12358: And from that outfit yer wearing, I'd wager ya were born in the Far East.${prompt}
  12359: That is correct. I am the guardian of Reisenjima Sanctorium, and have a strong link with the heavens as its chief priestess.${prompt}
  12360: Oho. I know the particulars of the eastern faith are a bit foreign ta the rest of us, but Altana remains a central figure even there.${prompt}

  12369: By your will.${prompt}
  12370: In the age from whence I hail, Vana'diel is gripped in the vise of fear.${prompt}
  12371: In my homeland, we refer to it as “Emptiness,” a blanket of darkness that infects all it touches.${prompt}
  12372: The master is our only light of hope. ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] halted the advance of such a sinister force once, and we are confident that ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] can do it again.${prompt}
  12373: The master and ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] comrades strove tirelessly for a brighter future, and their tale is known by all in time.${prompt}
  12374: Many months and years passed. I came to be in this world and trained diligently under the master's gentle hand. Yet it was not long before the skies began to cloud...both figuratively and literally.${prompt}
  12375: It descended like a thick miasma, stifling the land under a blanket of silence.${prompt}
  12376: I looked into the master's eyes and could see the truth. My homeland was not the only victim. Quon, Mindartia, Adoulin...${prompt}
  12377: The end times were upon us, and both man and Goddess were powerless to stop it.${prompt}
  12378: But then...how did ya survive?${prompt}
  12379: The master and my father sacrificed themselves.${prompt}
  12380: My mother is from an island known as Reisenjima, the land where the final struggle took place.${prompt}
  12381: Vanquishing the Emptiness was but a fantasy. It was all I could do to erect a barrier to halt its advance.${prompt}
  12382: A Pyrrhic victory, indeed, as the walls of Reisenjima's sanctorum could do naught but echo back my own solitary cries.${prompt}
  12383: I was trapped for several years, when a spirit descended from the heavens to alight on a nearby brazier.${prompt}
  12384: She told me that there was only one speck of hope that could save us...${prompt}
  12385: The master. I was to find the master and join my light with ${choice-player-gender}[his/hers].${prompt}
  12386: The spirits opened a path for me, guiding me back here...to this point in Vana'diel's history.${prompt}
  12387: Master, I would like to give you this, lest I forget to do so at a later juncture.${prompt}
  12388: From what you told me, there will be many trials posed to you before you finally set foot in the land you know today as the Far East.${prompt}
  12389: Keep this by your side and the path will remain open to you, always.${prompt}
  12390: Follow its guidance and it will lead you unfailingly to my time. However...${prompt}
  12391: Now jus' hang on a minute. If we jus' follow it without doin' anythin' else, we'll just end up at yer apocalyptic future where yer the only one left alive, right?${prompt}
  12392: '...That is correct. However, the master surely has the capacity to experience both futures...one with the Emptiness, and one without.${prompt}'
  12393: Please...find a way to...to...${prompt}
  12394: I cannot...stay...long...${prompt}
  12395: What in blazes--!?${prompt}
  12396: ${name-player}, I can't make heads or tails of the whole thing. Think she's tellin' the truth?${prompt}
  12397: This warrants further study. I'll see if my agents can pick up on anything.${prompt}
  12398: <Sigh> I've ne'er been too good at dealin' with complex twists and turns.${prompt}
  12399: Gimme some time ta collect me thoughts.${prompt}
  12400: Maybe there is somethin' ta that tale Iroha spun. There've been more an' more oddities happenin' of late.${prompt}
  12401: All manner of ne'er-before-seen beasts...people gettin' lost in places that look familiar but are somehow a bit off...and so much more that I could mention.${prompt}
  12402: At first I figured the beastmen were behind it all, but now I'm not so sure.${prompt}
  12403: We gotta take stock of the situation and dig up any common threads.${prompt}
  12404: Ideally, you'd be wantin' to talk to my daughter, Lion.${prompt}
  12405: A bit of a tomboy, that one, but there're none in the Middle Lands as could match her clue-gathering skills.${prompt}
  12406: There's just the small question of where she ran off ta this time.${prompt}
  12407: She bolted out of here a couple of days ago, asserting that the best way to ascertain the Beastman Confederate's plans was to put out feelers amongst allies in the three nations.${prompt}
  12408: It stands to reason, then, that she's either in Bastok, San d'Oria, or Windurst.${prompt}
  12409: Then ya might run across her durin' the course of some beastmen-related missions.${prompt}
  12410: Head back to yer home nation and follow up on that threat first.${prompt}
  12411: Normally I'd entrust this to me daughter, Lion...${prompt}

  12419: At least, Lion has a keen eye for these things.${prompt}
  12420: She's slowly regainin' her strength, but it's still not uncommon for her to spend the whole mornin' in bed either...${prompt}

  12425: Iroha's been pacin' back an' forth all day.${prompt}
  12426: Master, tales of your victory against the Shadow Lord has reached our ears!${prompt}
  12427: History is one battle closer to being set on the proper course.${prompt}
  12428: '...and also brings us closer ta oblivion.${prompt}'
  12429: But we first may bring history to the point where the master is able to face the future.${prompt}
  12430: Suppose so.${prompt}
  12431: Upon my return, I spent hours turning over the master's words in my mind, and something came to gnaw at me.${prompt}
  12432: I cannot shake the feeling it is related to what Lady Lion prophesized in Escha about the master's role in the coming battle against the darkness.${prompt}
  12433: Somethin' 'bout yer orb needin' ta gain light?${prompt}
  12434: Correct. We must create a world in which the master is able to fight.${prompt}
  12435: An' what 'bout that bothers ya?${prompt}
  12436: Think back upon your struggle with the Shadow Lord.${prompt}
  12437: When we first met, many years from now, the master mentioned something that happened that day.${prompt}
  12438: “I felt the crystal resonate within.”${prompt}
  12439: Please, try to think back.${prompt}
  12440: Warrior of the Crystal--one who will become known as a Warrior of Light...${prompt}
  12441: 'You ${choice: 1}[have traveled/will travel] across land, sea, and sky, bathed in the light and stopping darkness wherever it threatens the living.${prompt}'
  12442: And you will continue to banish the doubt that resides within you.${prompt}
  12443: Banish the doubt that lies within and let radiance fill your soul.${prompt}
  12444: Such travels take their toll on lesser mortals, who retire to their homes and live out their lives in comfort.${prompt}
  12445: But although you may stop briefly to gather your wits, each time you do so it is only to steel your resolve for the next struggle.${prompt}
  12446: You have the will to shelter the downtrodden, vex the darkness, and protect all that Altana holds dear.${prompt}
  12447: The time is right for you to become more than a mere warrior.${prompt}
  12448: |-
    You will become greater...${wait-36: 1}
    For that is what is required of you.${prompt}
  12449: Has it come back to you, Master?${prompt}
  12450: You recalled with reverence those words, saying they gave you the strength of spirit to carry on no matter the odds.${prompt}
  12451: Though your journeys were arduous and fraught with peril, the twinkle in your eyes as you recounted your tales gave me courage.${prompt}
  12452: The reason you were able to lead us in the final struggle was precisely because of those many barriers you had overcome.${prompt}
  12453: You taught me that the world was worth fighting for, no matter how bleak the future.${prompt}
  12454: My father always spoke of you with adoration, believing that you were a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] of indisputable valor.${prompt}
  12455: Banish your doubt, Master, so that you may become all you were meant to be!${prompt}
  12456: You have conquered much, and the time has come to fill yourself with radiance!${prompt}
  12457: Now that ya mention it, Iroha, just who is this father of yers?${prompt}

  12641: None in the Far East bear any ill will toward the priests of Reisenjima Sanctorium...${prompt}
  12642: And only the purest chosen by the emperor are allowed to alight on the isle housing Reisenjima Sanctorium, for it was created by the gods themselves.${prompt}
  12643: Any who would lift a blade in anger against such souls are unworthy of being called human.${prompt}
  12644: Then it should not surprise you to learn that our foe isn't human at all.${prompt}
  12645: Darkness is at his beck and call, and he can create entire worlds devoid of all color.${prompt}
  12646: I see...${prompt}

    Well, best for me not ta get in the middle.

  12672: Knowin' Tenzen, he's probably in a tizzy and gone to Misareaux Coast already.${prompt}
  12673: Truth be told, I can't imagine what it would be like ta die once, let alone over and over...${prompt}
  12674: Youth is always so brash. Hopefully the three of ya can overcome the trials that are ta come.${prompt}
  12675: Yar, Iroha's already given me the skinny.${prompt}

  12680: Ain't but a waddle away.${prompt}
  12681: Best place to find whatcha seek would be in the Temple of Uggalepih.${prompt}
  12682: But don't ya be needin' ta lay anchor in Kazham first?${prompt}
  12683: Sir Gilgamesh, I fear we know little and less about this temple of which you speak.${prompt}
  12684: It's a bit ta the east, beyond Yuhtunga Jungle, deep in th' innermost recesses of Yhoator Jungle.${prompt}
  12685: Surely you'll want a few of my best men ta go with ya. Wouldn't do havin' ya get lost.${prompt}
  12686: That would be a boon.${prompt}
  12687: Master, let us rendezvous at the temple.${prompt}
  12688: I relish the opportunity to meet with a Kuluu.${prompt}
  12689: ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}, perhaps you have some unfinished business to take care of first. We shall scout on ahead.${prompt}
  12690: I bid you finish your tasks without delay.${prompt}
  12691: ${name-player}, why the dour look? Everyone's looking to you for guidance, so keep your chin up!${prompt}
  12692: Yo, Zeid, ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] isn't th' only one. My head's been swimmin' with worry these past few days.${prompt}
  12693: It's about Escha, isn't it?${prompt}
  12694: I had one of my more trustworthy...friends see what he could find.${prompt}
  12695: Th' mystery grows deeper by th' day. As he spent more days within Escha, he began ta speak in tongues and happen upon knowledge that no one should have.${prompt}
  12696: It's spooked the lot of us.${prompt}
  12697: Hmmm?${prompt}
  12698: And speak of the devil. Atori-Tutori, how fares yer search?${prompt}
  12699: You asked me to go to Escha - Ru'Aun, and that's exactly what I did.${prompt}
  12700: Odd place, that one. The pastaru and the future are all garbled.${prompt}
  12701: I think I get it. It's a place where time doesn't exist.${prompt}
  12702: What do you mean, “doesn't exist”?${prompt}
  12703: Our li'l friend Siren was goin' on about it.${prompt}
  12704: We can only hope that no more o' those vortexes pop up. Hopefully Siren can figure out somethin'.${prompt}
  12705: Have you sought her out?${prompt}
  12706: Nay. But she's off ta fight the ambassador, so hopefully she'll give him his comeuppance.${prompt}
  12707: This kooky samurai guy was ranting on and on about seeing Siren in Misareaux Coast.${prompt}
  12708: That's more than just a passing oddity-woddity. Two of those biddies?${prompt}
  12709: Two biddies?${prompt}
  12710: Oho, perhaps “biddies” is too harsh of a term for one of such feminine wiles.${prompt}
  12711: That's not quite what I was getting at.${prompt}
  12712: But if there are two, wouldn't it stand to reason that it's another anomaly caused by the darkness?${prompt}
  12713: Who knows? It's possible my eyes were playing tricks on me.${prompt}
  12714: Anythin's possible given what we know of Escha so far.${prompt}
  12715: And speaking of Escha, we can head there again from that new vortex.${prompt}
  12716: |-
    Escha - Ru'Aun...
    I've heard tell that another masked individual has been coming and going from there.${prompt}
  12717: You know how Tenzen and Iroha are--they hear about something remotely dangerous and run off to fight it faster than a chocobo chasing gysahl greens.${prompt}
  12718: And knowing you, ${name-player}, you'll be right on their heels. Just promise you'll come back if things get out of hand.${prompt}
  12719: I gotta agree with the man. Doesn't take a seer ta read the ill omens there.${prompt}
  12720: Whole damn place is as silent as death itself.${prompt}
  12721: All the more reason for heroes-weroes like me to save what needs saving!${prompt}
  12722: Now that he's gone, Gilgamesh...just who is he?${prompt}
  12723: Just a man with special connections to th' Tenshodo.${prompt}
  12724: Might be a bit plump 'round the stomach, but ain't an adventurer in the world who hasn't--or isn't gonna--cross paths with him.${prompt}
  12725: Even ol' Maat in Jeuno respects this guy.${prompt}
  12726: Is that so?${prompt}
  12727: And ${name-player}--if ya wanna get a bit stronger yerself, I recommend ya talk with Maat before goin' ta Escha - Ru'Aun.${prompt}
  12728: If you say we can trust him, then I've no cause to doubt. Let's head for Escha - Ru'Aun.${prompt}
  12729: I dun know if Prishe 'n Tenzen are out swabbin' the decks, but they sure ain't here.${prompt}
  12730: The boss can't do a damned thing without th' two of 'em, so ya might wanna come back a bit later.${prompt}
  12731: Yo, ${name-player}. Guess who made it?${prompt}
  12732: Hehe! I decided to join in on the party.${prompt}
  12733: I know you're all chomping at the bit about your doom-and-gloom future, but it's the present that's really lit a fire under my behind.${prompt}
  12734: And c'mon. I'm not about to let the lot of you hog all the fun.${prompt}
  12735: There's been so much happening of late that I can't help but wonder if we should be more concerned with the “now” than the “then.”${prompt}
  12736: So I had been hoping that I could lend my aid to the cause.${prompt}
  12737: Gilgamesh filled me in on what happened after the whole Iroha in Jeuno thing.${prompt}
  12738: Gilgamesh was kind enough to give me an explanation on what happened after we left Jeuno.${prompt}
  12739: Goin' over every last detail woulda killed my voice, but I made sure ta cover the important parts.${prompt}
  12740: 'And I gotta admit--she ${choice: 1}[and Lion /]did a great job of watchin'' over Iroha.${prompt}'
  12741: Iroha's a real trooper. You gotta admire her spunk!${prompt}
  12742: I'm just glad Iroha has recovered nicely.${prompt}
  12743: Ah, ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}. Good to see you looking well.${prompt}
  12744: I trust that you successfully met with Selh'teus?${prompt}
  12745: Pray forgive me for what happened earlier.${prompt}
  12746: Let us put that behind us that we may discuss what you learned from him.${prompt}
  12747: A new crystal to be born in Reisenjima!?${prompt}
  12748: Finally, a light to pierce the clouds!${prompt}
  12749: Now this might clear up your whole “Emptiness” bit, eh, Tenzen? Victory all around!${prompt}
  12750: Sir Selh'teus's story about the crystal...it does not add up.${prompt}
  12751: If I remember correctly, the crystal does not appear now, but rather several years hence.${prompt}
  12752: So if history is to play out that way, then why...${prompt}
  12753: '...Why would it be changed now? Its coming is supposed to be long after the Emptiness has been pushed back.${prompt}'
  12754: I fear for how the future might change.${prompt}
  12755: But if this is to be the method for saving the Far East, then we have a responsibility to see it out!${prompt}
  12756: Do you mean for us to abandon hope!?${prompt}
  12757: This geezer's got the right of it. If the Emptiness has got a chokehold on the future, then we've gotta do everything we can to chop its arms off!${prompt}
  12758: So the crystal appears a few years earlier. What's the big deal?${prompt}
  12759: It simply has me concerned.${prompt}
  12760: Even though the crystal is there in my time, the all-encroaching darkness still claims victory.${prompt}
  12761: The crystal alone is not enough to save us.${prompt}
  12762: Then we need to come up with a solution that strikes at the root of the problem.${prompt}
  12763: Well, old buddy, looks like your journey isn't quite done.${prompt}
  12764: Well, Tenzen, you'll still be needing to pack a wallop, won't you?${prompt}
  12765: Sure, you might've stopped the Emptiness, but there's still a bit more darkness to smack around.${prompt}
  12766: The time for you to sheathe your blade hasn't arrived yet, Tenzen.${prompt}
  12767: Though the Emptiness has been stopped, Vana'diel still has need of your service.${prompt}
  12768: Long had I thought that it would be years before things returned to normal.${prompt}
  12769: But Selh'teus's crystal is a grand step in a positive direction.${prompt}
  12770: But, Sir Tenzen, something still vexes me.${prompt}
  12771: If I remember correctly, the crystal does not appear now, but rather several years hence.${prompt}
  12772: If the crystal were to manifest now, then the future will be irrevocably altered.${prompt}
  12773: But is that not exactly what we desire?${prompt}
  12774: So the crystal appears a few years earlier. What's the big deal?${prompt}
  12775: Should we not be glad that the problem may be solved before it even starts?${prompt}
  12776: Perhaps.${prompt}
  12777: Yet even though the crystal is there in my time, the all-encroaching darkness still claims victory.${prompt}
  12778: The crystal alone is not enough to save us.${prompt}
  12779: No matter how much we bash our heads against the problem, we can't find a good solution.${prompt}
  12780: I'll be damned if we aren't overlooking something... What is causing the Emptiness?${prompt}
  12781: I don't understand what could be wrong.${prompt}
  12782: We're clearly overlooking something. Do you think Bahamut might have the answers we seek?${prompt}
  12783: Lady Prishe, please continue to hunt for clues.${prompt}
  12784: '''Course I will!${prompt}'
  12785: Of course.${prompt}
  12786: '...Master.${prompt}'
  12787: Please proffer your opinion on Selh'teus's crystal plan.${prompt}
  12788: |-
    What do you think?
    ${selection-lines}
    I think earlier is fine.
    We should be careful.
    I'll do anything to meet Altana.${prompt}
  12789: If it means solvin' the problems in the Far East, then I'm all fer it.${prompt}
  12790: And it's good for business, too.${prompt}
  12791: So let's summarize, hmm?${prompt}
  12792: Iroha is opposed ta Selh'teus's plan, hmm?${prompt}
  12793: You and Iroha are opposed to Selh'teus's plan, hmm?${prompt}
  12794: “Opposed” may be too strong a word. I would simply implore us to proceed with utmost caution.${prompt}
  12795: I believe we can trust Siren when she says that the crystal in the Far East was intimately connected with this problem.${prompt}
  12796: We must banish the Emptiness surrounding Reisenjima to have any hope of meeting Altana...${prompt}
  12797: 'That must be the reason why Siren gave us the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  12798: And the orb I entrusted to Master remains pivotal.${prompt}
  12799: It is a priceless artifact of Reisenjima Sanctorium that ties the bearer with the mothercrystal.${prompt}
  12800: None are lost when they follow its guidance.${prompt}
  12801: We should not brashly rush into an uncertain decision, but instead wait for a sign.${prompt}
  12802: Well, ${name-player}, if you agree, then we've gotta take a different approach.${prompt}
  12803: Namely, finding out more about that beastie what's stealin' the crystals' power.${prompt}
  12804: And if Selh'teus wants you to find someone with “an absolute dominion over magic”... ${prompt}
  12805: Then there's only one person I can think of.${prompt}
  12806: That old witch, Shantotto!${prompt}
  12807: Of course, old la...er, Shantotto!${prompt}
  12808: I'm loath to say this, but perhaps he meant Doctor Shantotto.${prompt}
  12809: I'm...not sure if bringin' Iroha along's the best idea.${prompt}
  12810: Why would that be?${prompt}
  12811: If she found out you were from the future, she'd poke, prod, and quite possibly vivisect you.${prompt}
  12812: '${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}, we have our next destination: Windurst Walls.${prompt}'
  12813: Bring me a present!${prompt}
  12814: Best of luck!${prompt}
  12815: Could it be that the one trying to steal the crystals' energy is not the ambassador, but...?${prompt}
  12816: Master!${prompt}
  12817: The butterflies in my stomach have calmed down knowing that you are all right.${prompt}
  12818: What a horrifying tale...${prompt}
  12819: So this Balamor was tryin' ta create a world for him, and him alone.${prompt}
  12820: And he was usin' th' ambassador to do just that?${prompt}
  12821: I can't decide if he's a master or a moron.${prompt}
  12822: I can recall that Master told me stories of how ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] came across Balamor in ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] adventures throughout Eastern Ulbuka.${prompt}
  12823: I have heard tales of such a specter in Eastern Ulbuka.${prompt}
  12824: This may yet be another aspect of history I have changed by coming here.${prompt}
  12825: And now th' important question. ${name-player}, what of th' ambassador?${prompt}
  12826: |-
    What happened to the ambassador?
    ${selection-lines}
    I don't know.
    He may still be enchained.
    He might have gotten away.${prompt}
  12827: The question is whether he still resides in the vortex, or if he managed to escape...${prompt}
  12828: Not knowing where he is poses quite the obstacle in proceeding.${prompt}
  12829: Well, I'd say this--if that Balamor guy's vortex disappeared, then I'd bet gil ta grapes that th' ties binding him vanished, too.${prompt}
  12830: On th' “bright” side, this may have bought us more time ta light up that orb of yers.${prompt}
  12831: Well, I'd say this--if that Balamor guy's vortex disappeared, then I'd bet gil ta grapes that th' ties binding him vanished, too.${prompt}
  12832: On th' “bright” side, this may have bought us more time ta light up that orb of yers.${prompt}
  12833: Should that be the case, he may make another attempt on your life, Master.${prompt}
  12834: I just hope we can get that orb filled with light in time!${prompt}
  12835: In any event, there's no need for the two of ya ta be brash. If Selh'teus called you to Al'Taieu, then that's where ya should probably be going.${prompt}
  12836: I concur.${prompt}
  12837: Master, let us head for the mothercrystal.${prompt}
  12838: I shall meet you there.${prompt}
  12839: |-
    ${name-player}!?
    ${name-player}!${prompt}
  12840: I knew it'd take more than that to keep my old pal down!${prompt}
  12841: Oh, I'm so glad you made it back safely!${prompt}
  12842: Figured it'd take more'n that ta keep ya down!${prompt}
  12843: Ya do remember what happened, right?${prompt}
  12844: O'er in Al'Taieu you crossed swords with th' ambassador, and he left ya nothin' but a corpse!${prompt}
  12845: '...Or so I heard. Not like I was actually there ta see th'' whole thing.${prompt}'
  12846: Iroha told us everything.${prompt}
  12847: She attempted to call upon Phoenix's power so that you'd return to us.${prompt}
  12848: But you started to vanish--your body disappearing into the void.${prompt}
  12849: <Sigh> Iroha said her heart skipped a few thousand beats, and it was all we could do to calm her down.${prompt}
  12850: Vana'diel is a strange place. Iroha came ta me in my dreams and told me what happened.${prompt}
  12851: She tried ta call upon Phoenix's power so that ya'd return to us.${prompt}
  12852: She said yer body started to disappear inta th' void.${prompt}

  12875: All that's left is ta tell Iroha th' good news...${prompt}
  12876: But no one knows where she went.${prompt}
  12877: In my dream, she was in front of the crystal, surrounded by a strange glow.${prompt}
  12878: It's got to be related to Reisenjima.${prompt}
  12879: In my dream, she was in front o' th' crystal, surrounded by this strange glow.${prompt}

  12881: But with all th' Emptiness in the eastern seas, there's no way we can get there.${prompt}
  12882: I got Zeid and th' Tenshodo makin' inquiries, seein' if Iroha might be somewhere on the other continents.${prompt}
