    Huh? Have I met you before?
    This is the Culinarians' Guild.
    As you can guess, it is an association for professional cooks.${prompt}
  7240: |-
    I understand you not wanting to rush into anything.
    As you can see, we have to keep a clean kitchen, so it's not the kind of place unauthorized people should hang about in.${prompt}
  7241: |-
    Well, it's done, then!
    Lately, a lot of adventurers have been signing up to learn.
    Here. Study a little crystal synthesis with this...${prompt}
  7242: |-
    To put it simply, crystals are solidified energy.
    Crystal synthesis utilizes that energy to cook individual ingredients into a finished dish.${prompt}
  7243: |-
    But it's not as easy as it looks.
    If the cook can't visualize the finished product properly, he could fail, wasting all the ingredients in the process.${prompt}
  7244: |-
    So you need to gain as much practice as possible.
    Only the cook who understands the very essence of his ingredients can make truly exquisite cuisine.${prompt}
  7245: |-
    Start with the basics and gradually build yourself up.
    If you need the recipes, your fellow guildsmen can tell you how to make delicacies from all around the world.${prompt}
  7246: |-
    People have to eat every day, and you do not have to be a connoisseur to judge what tastes good.
    So the ones who provide the food for them have to keep on improving their skills, or the diner will go elsewhere.${prompt}
  7247: |-
    How have you been?
    To tell you the truth, when I see your face, my mouth starts watering and my stomach starts talking... Are you going to make anything for us today?${prompt}
  7248: "It's about time you moved on to the next culinarian level.\nHere then... \nWhip me up ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}"

    Hmm... It's quite well done.

    Your hard work and toil have finally paid off!
    I present you with the title of adept!

  7255: |-
    Oh, look...! You made me mix the wrong quantities.
    If there's something you want, ask the bigwig standing over there.${prompt}

    I think you'd make a good ${item-singular: 0[2]}, if you tried.

    Remember all I've told you and you'll go far.

  7261: |-
    Excuse my ill manners, but I've got my hands full.
    If there's something you want, ask the master chef.${prompt}
  7262: Begging your pardon, but didn't we just help you a minute ago?${prompt}
  7263: |-
    You don't possess enough gil, I'm afraid.

    You might make me slip up.${prompt}
  7268: I don't believe you need any assistance right now.${prompt}
  7269: |-
    Sorry, but I can see you don't have enough gil.
    Perhaps you're a castaway who finally made it back to dry land, and now needs money to get home?
    Right...that's the oldest line in the book.${prompt}
  7270: Clear your mind and meditate...${prompt}
  7271: 'With your current culinary skills, I believe ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is about your cup of tea...${prompt}'

  7284: I heard from some of my acquaintances that you've become a craftsman at another guild. While I can appreciate your yearning to be a jack-of-all-trades, I am disappointed at your choice not to focus on perfecting your cooking skills.${prompt}
  7285: The culinary arts is a delicate field. A lack of focus could ruin a whole meal--flatten a whole soufleé!${prompt}
  7286: That is why I warn you. If you truly want to become a master chef, you should revoke your craftsman skill status at all other guilds and concentrate on cooking, cooking, and more cooking!${prompt}

    Revoke all other craftsman statuses?
    ${selection-lines}

    Now that's a scrumptious answer!
    First, you'll be wanting to acquire a copy of ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} from Qhum Knaidjn.${prompt}
  7294: You'll need a dash of guild points for the transaction, but a chef of your skills should need only a pinch of effort to accrue them.${prompt}

    What is this foul taste in my mouth?
    Why, I believe it's my bitter disappointment at the potential you're allowing to go to waste.${prompt}
  7296: 'First, you''ll want to speak to Qhum Knaidjn and obtain yourself ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'

    Very well, then! Wash your hands, put on your chef's hat, and whip me up ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.
    First you'll have to hunt down the ingredients, of course, a task which I doubt will be as easy as pamama pie.${prompt}

    I hereby bestow upon you the rank of expert, and give you my explicit permission to look down your nose at all the faux gourmands around you!${prompt}
  7302: |-
    An admirable attempt, yet it lacks a certain...something.
    Ah, your signature! Do you find your dish so lacking in flavor and pizazz that you are unwilling to take credit for it?${prompt}
  7303: |-
    No, I'm afraid this won't do at all...but you didn't need me to tell you that.
    Back to the cutting board for you. Chop chop!${prompt}
  7304: 'I think that you are ready to enter the leagues of the great chefs. Mix me up ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'

    Is it true that you've achieved the rank of ${choice: 5}[artisan/adept/veteran] in a guild other than our own?
    I must say, ${name-player}, this leaves a terribly bad taste in my mouth.${prompt}
  7310: |-
    A chef must be first and foremost a chef.
    Waste too much time on idle pursuits and your tarts will lose their tang, your stews their savor!${prompt}
  7311: |-
    Luckily, there is still time to do right by your taste buds.
    Say the word and I can revoke your ${choice: 5}[artisan/adept/veteran] status in any lesser guilds.${prompt}
  7312: |-
    It is simply a matter of my calling the guildmaster and informing them of your desire to focus on your culinary pursuits.
    So what do you say, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  7313: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}. To think that I shall never again know the gustatory bliss that is one of your scrumptious ${item-plural: 2[2]}!

  7393: What a strange piece of headwear! Where can one obtain such a fashion statement?${prompt}
  7394: A new style from the local milliner, Baren-Moren? Not that I would ever entertain the thought of wearing Tarutaru apparel, of course. But perhaps I could purchase one as a conversation piece for back home.${prompt}
  7395: Huh...?${prompt}
  7396: There's something different about you compared to the other adventurers.${prompt}
  7397: |-
    What is that hat you're holding?
    Let me have a look.${prompt}
  7398: Hmm...this must be the latest style from the local hatter. It's about time I had some new headwear made. Perhaps I'll drop by later...${prompt}
  7399: |-
    Wait right there!
    Hey, I said wait!${prompt}
  7400: That hat you have there...it must be the latest style by that mad hatter.${prompt}
  7401: Okay, now that I know there's a new type of hat available, I have no need for you. Make yourself scarce, kid!${prompt}
  7402: |-
    Munch-munch...gloomph...bellllch!
    That is an intriguing hat you have there!${prompt}
  7403: |-
    Hey, that could make a great story!
    Thanks, that's my scoop of the day!${prompt}
  7404: |-
    Ho-hohohoho!
    You're trying to make me buy another-wother hat?
    That's like preaching to the converted.${prompt}
  7405: |-
    Alright then...
    I'll buy just one more.${prompt}
  7406: |-
    Ho-hohohoho!
    I didn't buy it for the hat itself. I bought it to show appreciation for your efforts...perhaps?${prompt}
  7407: |-
    Hang your hat up?
    ${selection-lines}
    Not yet.
    Yes. Done.${prompt}
  7408: If you're throwing in the hat, then I'm taking it back from you.${prompt}
  7409: |-
    Hey, you didn't seem to do any work at all.
    You have the impudence to ask for a wage for that? What do you think I am, a charity?${prompt}
  7410: |-
    There'll be no passing the hat around here!
    Get out of here, you slacker!${prompt}
  7411: That didn't go very well at all. I didn't get a single inquiry, let alone an order.${prompt}
  7412: Anyway, here's a little pocket money for your limited effort, bad hat. Don't spend it all at once.${prompt}
  7413: |-
    It's not my workmanship that's the problem.
    It's my poor choice of hired help!
    Why did I ever bother asking you?${prompt}
  7414: A few orders have trickled in, but nothing like I had expected. This style should have caught on like wildfire.${prompt}
  7415: |-
    Anyway, here's your pocket money.
    Don't spend it all at once.${prompt}
  7416: I guess that's what happens when you ask an amateur to do your advertising. I had better go put on my thinking cap...${prompt}
  7417: That's a lot of orders we've had. My new style of hat is so charming, it's a crime!${prompt}
  7418: |-
    You've earned yourself quite a hefty cut of the sales, young'un. Watch you don't get cat burgled!
    I'll also give you one of my hats for good measure.${prompt}
  7419: Both my workmanship and my skill in selecting hired help are spot on! I won the wager. That'll make Bondada eat her hat.${prompt}
  7420: |-
    I take my hat off to you.
    Why, I even have orders coming in from other countries! I don't know what you did, but it worked wonders.${prompt}
  7421: Your talent in advertising is almost as brilliantaru as my talent in hatmaking. Here, take the hat as a reward.${prompt}
  7422: You seem to have a sense of business there, young'un. Perhaps you should wear two hats, and take up advertising as a side job to your adventuring?${prompt}
  7423: Come back to this shop when you have the time, and train yourself to become a hat connoisseur.${prompt}
  7424: |-
    Ho-hohohoho!
    Too true, too true.${prompt}
  7425: |-
    Ho-hohohoho!
    You did well, my dear. I'd throw my hat into the air if we weren't indoors.${prompt}
  7426: |-
    Ho-hohohoho!
    I rather enjoyed that little bet I had with Baren-Moren over you.${prompt}
  7427: |-
    Ho-hohohoho!
    Baren-Moren has a bee in his bonnet!${prompt}
  7428: |-
    I'm in a bit of a fix...
    but it doesn't concern you.${prompt}
  7429: If you're not here to buy one of my hats, then hurry up and leave.${prompt}
  7430: I'm in a bit of a fix... Would you be so good as to hear me out...?${prompt}
  7431: Some big-wigged madam wants me to make her a particularly luxurious hat... Arrrgh!${prompt}
  7432: I'm reluctant, as my hats aren't just for appearance's sake.${prompt}
  7433: |-
    Ho-hohohoho!
    You're just saying that, Baren-Moren, because you don't know what “luxurious” means!${prompt}
  7434: I already told you, Bondada, I can make something as simple as a grande dame's hat with my eyes shut.${prompt}
  7435: |-
    That's it!
    Hey, ${name-player}!
    Want to help me out here?${prompt}
  7436: |-
    Help make the lady's luxurious hat?
    ${selection-lines}
    Give it a try.
    Decline.${prompt}
  7437: |-
    Why you...!
    You just came here to see me wear a dunce's cap too, didn't you?${prompt}

  7439: Now you know what I need, so hurry up and get them!${prompt}

    Hurry up and get me those feathers!
    I'll make that woman eat her hat!${prompt}
  7441: Well done. You were able to get all I needed.${prompt}
  7442: That caps off this story! Here, this should pay for your efforts.${prompt}
  7443: Prepare yourself, Bondada! I'll show you what a luxurious hat is!${prompt}
  7444: |-
    Ho-hohohoho!
    You're one fine feather...
    Fine feather, indeed.${prompt}
  7445: A little while ago, Barrren-Morrren asked Bondada what she wanted as a gift.${prompt}
  7446: Those two always seem to be fighting and putting each otherrr down, but deep down they rrreally like one anotherrr.${prompt}
  7447: Remember that luxurious hat I was making? Well, it seems that I don't have enough plumage.${prompt}
  7448: Would you be so good as to help me out again? Then you can help me ruffle Bondada's feathers.${prompt}
  7449: 'I need three more ${item-plural: 1[2]} that you can pluck from the monsters on the Sauromugue Champaign and Meriphataud Mountains.${prompt}'
  7450: So hurry up and plucking get me those feathers!${prompt}

  7545: Ask the Orastery's minister at their Mage Academy for the details.${prompt}

    Oh my, oh why...?

  7573: To get to Windurst Woods, you have to pass through either Windurst Walls to the east, or Port Windurst to the south.${prompt}
  7574: It's a long way to walk, but it's a good chance to get to know our country. Check your map to find the way, then consider it a leisurely strolly-wolly.${prompt}
  7575: I can't hide the fact that I'm a big fan of Apururu from the Manustery!${prompt}

  7577: Listen here! You better complete Apururu's mission as fasty-wasty and as perfectly-werfectly as possible. Don't you dare mess up! You got it?${prompt}
  7578: Cardians are our automaton guards. They were originally created twenty years ago by Zonpa-Zippa, the Minister of the Manustery.${prompt}
  7579: It's hard enough to collect the materials to make them, but it takes even more effort to train them. Occasionally a few go bonkers-wonkers and run away...or that's what the guys from the Manustery say.${prompt}

  7583: Have you become comfortable with performing missions yet?${prompt}
  7584: Today, I'm thinking about asking you to do a very-wery important mission.${prompt}
  7585: Your destination will be Giddeus. It's where the Yagudo beastmen dwell, on the other side of West Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  7586: Do you know much about the Yagudo? Windurst fought them in the war twenty years ago, but we currently maintain amicable relations.${prompt}
  7587: As a sign of our friendship, we provide them with food offerings. That about sums up your mission-wission.${prompt}
  7588: The Rhinostery prepares the food offerings. You can pick them up at the biological laboratory here at the south side of Windurst Waters.${prompt}
  7589: Once you have received the food offerings from the researchers there, you should head straight to Giddeus.${prompt}
  7590: I don't want you to get worked up about it, but this mission could affect the future of Windurst. It's that important!${prompt}
  7591: Please be extremely careful!${prompt}
  7592: First, head to the Rhinostery's biological laboratory here in the south of Windurst Waters.${prompt}
  7593: Once you have received the food offerings from the researchers there, go straight to the food offering altars in Giddeus. Exercise the utmost caution-waution!${prompt}
  7594: I know we shouldn't ask this, but... Why do we have to provide the Yagudo with all this stuff anyway?${prompt}
  7595: The beastman hordes were utterly defeated by our allied forces in the war twenty years ago, weren't they? So what's the dealy-wealy?${prompt}
  7596: |-
    Make no mistakey-wakeys!
    Although we're supposed to be on friendly terms with the Yagudo, Giddeus is still a dangerous dungeon.${prompt}
  7597: |-
    Even if you explain that you're simply a messenger from Windurst, they'll say that they have to “test” you to determine the truth.
    Then they all start to attack you.${prompt}
  7598: Of course, if you step in there without any real reason, they'll claim that you're encroaching on their sacred territory, and attack you in full force. They are most irritating.${prompt}

    Wait right here, if you don't mind...
    I'll go get it, from out behind.${prompt}
  7603: |-
    Here you go... Sorry for all the fuss.
    Today's offering for the altars of Giddeus.${prompt}
  7604: |-
    In these bags are Yagudo's favorite cherries.
    These should give those ugly old beastmen their merries.${prompt}
  7605: |-
    If you are wondering why there're now two bags,
    it's 'cause there're two altars in Giddeus's crags.
    A Yagudo by each altar stands.
    To each of them a bag you hand.${prompt}
  7606: |-
    And though an offering you do bear,
    those Yagudo may attack you there.
    So take precautions, be prepared...
    Lest you return in states impaired!♪${prompt}
  7607: |-
    The places where the altars of offering stand,
    are a little way into the Giddeus land.
    Before the entrances of the caves they are,
    so be careful not to venture in too far.${prompt}
  7608: |-
    And though an offering you do bear,
    those Yagudo may attack you there.
    So be prepared and best of luck,
    unless you are a lucky...schmuck.♪${prompt}
  7609: You're the adventurer who accepted our mission for today? Leepe-Hoppe has prepared the food offerings for you to take to Giddeus. He's waiting on the rooftop orchard right above us.${prompt}
  7610: To get to the roof, go outside and take the stairs on the side of the building.${prompt}
  7611: At first there was just one altar for offerings in Giddeus. So we only needed to take one bag of food.${prompt}
  7612: Then one day, those sneaky Yagudo decided to build another altar. They are so greedy.${prompt}
  7613: Food...bag...offering...${prompt}
  7614: from...Culi...narians'...Guild...${prompt}

    We of the Rhinostery would like to
    explore the underground canals too.${prompt}
  7617: |-
    And investigate why the great beast
    disappeared after the war ceased.${prompt}
  7618: "But the entrance to the canals in Windurst Walls,\nhas been off-limits for twenty years, 'spite our calls.\nKnown only as the Priming Gate, \nCardians guard it as of late.${prompt}"
  7619: |-
    I know, I know.
    That's why I'm asking you for your cooperation.${prompt}
  7620: |-
    Our objectives coincide...
    I'm in search of Karaha-Baruha's laboratory, and you're in search of the great beast's lair.${prompt}
  7621: |-
    But opening the Priming Gate is no easy thing,
    the key is our Rhinostery minister's ring.
    And Minister Rukususu wouldn't to you lend,
    her ring even if you were really her friend.${prompt}
  7622: "You don't get what I'm saying. That's why I'm asking you! \nListen. On the night Rukususu comes back from the Northlands...${prompt}"
  7623: |-
    ...Let's continue this discussion later!

  7624: |-
    Back from Giddeus now, I see!
    Your mission's done. What joy, what glee!${prompt}
  7625: |-
    Oh, that was the Orastery minister, Ajido-Marujido,
    who wants to go to Karaha-Baruha's lab in the canals so...${prompt}
  7626: |-
    So it really is the truth, what the rumors say...
    he's been asking about forbidden magic today.${prompt}
  7627: |-
    I'm surprised he doesn't get caught without quibble,
    by Windurst's Sibyl Guards and the great Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  7628: |-
    Anyway, your task's complete, your mission done,
    so return to the gatehouse where you begun.${prompt}
  7629: |-
    Ha-ha! I'm sure something great,
    awaits you back at the gate!${prompt}
  7630: |-
    Well, your task's complete, your mission done.
    Return to the gatehouse where you begun.${prompt}
  7631: |-
    Ha-ha! I'm sure something great,
    awaits you back at the gate!${prompt}
  7632: |-
    Well done.
    Relieved to see you made it back in one piecey-wiecey.${prompt}
  7633: |-
    And congratulations are in order!
    You have successfully completed three missions, and have received enough rank points to go up in rank.${prompt}
  7634: Now that you made rank two, you can participate in conquests. To find out more about conquests, ask one of the conquest guards.${prompt}
  7635: You need to gain rank points by participating in conquests before you can receive any further missions.${prompt}
  7636: Let's keep working together for the sake of Windurst.${prompt}
  7637: "You were able to deliver the goods to Giddeus, huh?\nCongratulations! \nThat means you're now rank two!${prompt}"
  7638: The higher-wigher you go up in rank, the harder-warder the missions become.${prompt}
  7639: And you have to boldly rush into places where angels fear to tread. It really is tough!${prompt}
  7640: "Whoa! \nYou're alive?\nAre you sure you're not a ghosty-whosty?${prompt}"
  7641: |-
    Giddeus really was a scary-wary place, right?

    Do you accept this mission?${prompt}

  7649: |-
    Very well...
    Go meet the Minister of the Optistery.${prompt}
  7650: |-
    The Library of Magic is straight up the road there.
    The road runs between the two wings of the Optistery building.${prompt}
  7651: If you head straight back up the road there, you'll pass through the archway of a two-story building that opens out into the Huntsman's Court.${prompt}
  7652: That's the Optistery. The Library of Magic is housed there. The Optistery stores a vast collection of books and scrolls that it lends out to the general public.${prompt}
  7653: It's very unusual for the Optistery to ask for assistance from the gatehouses.${prompt}
  7654: For ordinary overdue library books, the Optistery just asks any passer-by to help them out. I wonder if something serious has happened!?${prompt}
  7655: I don't read at all, so I have no interest in the library.${prompt}
  7656: Reading books just isn't in vogue these days. It has to have the impact and excitement of a wandering minstrel's song or a street performance to grab the attention of people today.${prompt}

    Hrrrmmmmmm...hrm!${prompt}
  7660: |-
    ...Hrm!?
    Sorry about that.
    I was just thinking...${prompt}
  7661: I'm facing my first crisis since taking over as Minister of the Optistery here...${prompt}
  7662: |-
    .........Hrm?
    By the way, who in my stars are you?
    Wha-wha-what? You're the adventurer sent here to help from the gatehouse?${prompt}
  7663: |-
    ......Hrmmmm?
    Oh, so you're the adventurer sent here to help from the gatehouse, huh?${prompt}
  7664: |-
    Well then, let me explain.
    Hrmmm......
    Where do I start?${prompt}
  7665: Firstly, do you know the role of the Optistery's Library of Magic?${prompt}
  7666: This is a repository for the storage and preservation of innumerable scrolls and books, from ages long past right up to the present.${prompt}
  7667: The most important role of our librarians is to consign our entrusted writings to posterity, without ever losing a single one of them.${prompt}
  7668: Why, even during that terrible war twenty years ago, we were able to protect almost all of the books.${prompt}
  7669: But the restricted books section is another matter.${prompt}
  7670: Restricted books are never allowed to be taken out of the Library of Magic, and are normally sealed away in a special room.${prompt}
  7671: Manuscripts, life-threateningly dangerous to those weak in magical power...${prompt}
  7672: Books of the dark arts, not to be viewed by mortal eyes... Ancient scrolls not even the Minister of the Optistery is allowed to open...${prompt}
  7673: All of which are writings that, if taken outside, would cause great calamity. However, one very important book disappeared during the war twenty years ago, and has never been seen since.${prompt}
  7674: But recently, I received word that said book had fallen into the dirty paws of that outrageous Mithran Cat Burglar who inhabits Windurst Woods.${prompt}
  7675: Although the source of this information is dubious, the possibility that she has that book is a matter of great consequence.${prompt}
  7676: |-
    That's where you come in...
    I want you to go meet that so-called “Cat Burglar” and confirm whether or not she possesses any of our restricted books.${prompt}
  7677: The Optistery must retrieve any restricted books back as soon as possible, and at any cost. We are counting on you!${prompt}
  7678: |-
    Hrmmm......
    I wonder if that so-called Mithran “Cat Burglar” really has one of our restricted books.${prompt}
  7679: If it is true, it's a gravely dangerous situation. Anyone with weak magical powers would be killed the second they opened such a book!${prompt}
  7680: One of the restricted books lost during the war has come to light?${prompt}
  7681: Tosuka-Porika has been searching so hard for those lost restricted books ever since he became minister.${prompt}
  7682: We can all sleep easier if we find even one lost book.${prompt}
  7683: I wonder what in Vana'diel is contained in the missing restricted book?${prompt}
  7684: But, I guess with our level of magic, we couldn't open it, let alone read what's inside... Then again, I'd like to peek at what's on the cover, at least.${prompt}
  7685: Some ancient manuscripts are enchanted with extremely powerful magic, and don't need to have the contents transcribed letter by letter like this.${prompt}
  7686: They are the restricted books...special writings that only the Minister of the Optistery is allowed to handle.${prompt}
  7687: |-
    ...Huah? What's that you say...?
    Oh, yeah, the restricted book that was lost twenty years back...?${prompt}
  7688: Yeah, it sounds like a lot of trouble. So much of a hurry-scurry, I can hardly sleep...${prompt}
  7689: |-
    What's going on?
    The minister seems to be troubled... But the dimwit at the counter is half-asleep as usual.${prompt}
  7690: I'm quite knowledgeable about the war of twenty years ago, as it's in our history textbooks. When the town became a battlefield, the librarians carried the books through the flames to Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  7691: Many of the librarians lost their lives as they ran there and back again, over and over through the flames.  Or so the history books say... Quite a tragic tale when you think about it.${prompt}
  7692: |-
    Hrmm!?
    Oh, you're finally back!${prompt}
  7693: |-
    How did it go?
    Did that so-called Mithran “Cat Burglar” really have her paws on one of our restricted books?${prompt}
  7694: |-
    ...Wha-wha-wha-what!? Preposterous!
    The Book of the Gods...!? No...!
    The time for the Book of the Gods to lose its magic has come...!? Wha...!?${prompt}
  7695: It's said that when the Book of the Gods loses its magic power and returns to blank pages, the shadows of destruction will set upon our world...${prompt}
  7696: Hrm! Really, how could such a fearful thing ever happen!?${prompt}
  7697: Ajido-Marujido! I bet you wanted the Book of the Gods so badly that you came up with this preposterous lie. Hrmmm...${prompt}
  7698: Don't you worry about Ajido-Marujido! I'll report him to the Star Sibyl myself.${prompt}
  7699: |-
    And as for you, adventurer.
    I must warn you to forget this ever happened! You understand?${prompt}
  7700: Hrmmmm! You must not frighten the others with rumors that the Book of the Gods has gone blank. Forget everything that happened. You understand?${prompt}
  7701: There are many restricted books, but the Book of the Gods is in a class of its own.${prompt}
  7702: It's called a history book, but it doesn't just contain history. Sorry. It's not my specialty, so I don't know the details.${prompt}
  7703: So, all that talk about finding one of our lost restricted books turned out to be empty rumors.${prompt}
  7704: The minister won't be able to sleep any easier after all. Poor thing...${prompt}
  7705: The Book of the Gods is said to contain fearful knowledge that is written in incredibly difficult incantations.${prompt}
  7706: The previous minister of our Optistery, the great genius Karaha-Baruha, might have been able to decipher it...${prompt}
  7707: |-
    ...Huah? What's that you say...?
    Book of the Gods?${prompt}
  7708: "I prefer a nooks of the nods myself...\nLeave me alone... \nZZZzzz...${prompt}"
  7709: |-
    What's going on?
    The minister seems to be troubled... But the dimwit at the counter is half-asleep as usual.${prompt}
  7710: Hey, I wonder if they have any books written by one of the line of great geniuses?${prompt}
  7711: I should ask the minister about it one day.${prompt}
  7712: An interesting mission has just come in from the Aurastery's School of Magic.${prompt}
  7713: |-
    What do you think?
    Do you accept this mission?${prompt}
  7714: |-
    Accept Mission?
    ${selection-lines}
    Accept.
    Decline.${prompt}
  7715: This is the first time you've accepted a mission for the Aurastery, right? The School of Magic run by the Aurastery is here in the eastern side of Windurst Waters.${prompt}
  7716: The principal of the school is away as usual, so ask the teachers as to what your task is.${prompt}
  7717: You've been to the Aurastery before, right? The School of Magic run by the Aurastery is here on the east side of Windurst Waters.${prompt}
  7718: The School of Magic run by the Aurastery is here on the east side of Windurst Waters.${prompt}
  7719: To find out what the mission is about, ask the teachers in the staff room there.${prompt}
  7720: |-
    The School of Magic!?
    That place is a number-crunching hell! One step inside there and you're instantly differentiated and evaluated.${prompt}
  7721: |-
    Shivers!
    That place is, like, 2.352 times scarier than Giddeus!${prompt}
  7722: That School of Magic is full of cheeky little genius brats. They are constantly poking their noses into adult business, so it should be interesting to see what kind of adults they become themselves.${prompt}
  7723: |-
    You got it!
    I abhor children. I don't even want to believe I was once one myself.${prompt}

  7728: You remember the errand, I recall, but let me rapidly reiterate to be real sure...${prompt}
  7729: We're setting up a skills test for our school's students to see how many monsters they can slay.${prompt}
  7730: |-
    Are you the adventurer who accepted the Aurastery's ardent assignment?
    Excellent! We were excitedly expecting you.${prompt}
  7731: The School of Magic is setting up a skills test to see how many monsters the students of the advanced class can slay.${prompt}
  7732: We applied for an able adventurer to assist us in arranging our skills exam, all right?${prompt}
  7733: You're expecting an elementary exam, except at the School of Magic it is an enormous event that affects the educatees' enlightened existence and so we extoll excruciating exactness.${prompt}
  7734: First, fine friend, find out how ferociously fierce the foes are in the field where the skills test is being formulated.${prompt}
  7735: Carry this charmed doll to Tahrongi Canyon, can you? My magic mannequin will memorize how many monsters you maim there.${prompt}
  7736: The doll's enchantment expires at the end of one day. Once the wizardly works wear off it's worthless... So kindly come back quick.${prompt}
  7737: I'll immediately magick my miniature marionette. I presume you are punctually prepared?${prompt}
  7738: |-
    Ready already?

  7739: |-
    Incantation incorporated.
    Godspeed and Goddess bless!${prompt}
  7740: '...Return when you''re arranged, not deranged.${prompt}'
  7741: See how many monsters you may maim in Tahrongi Canyon, can you? The counting charm cast on the magic doll disappears in a day. Better be back by then!${prompt}
  7742: The skills test will be performed in threes, pertaining it's particularly preferable to appropriate a party with experienced explorers.${prompt}
  7743: |-
    Wow...I avow it's now ${number: 1}!
    So, lo, ${number: 2} ${choice-plurality: 2}[hour/hours] to go.

    Get along there! Not much longer to the gong, hear?${prompt}

    Blast... It's at last past ${number: 1}.
    I'm bereft there's only ${number: 2} ${choice-plurality: 2}[hour/hours] left.
    Your time's as good as up I see, so return the magic doll to me.${prompt}

    There, there, don't be such a square.
    Loosen up a little, gee...
    Be more footloose and fancy free.${prompt}
  7747: |-
    Do not worry that your grading shall
    smite the student's fate forever, pal.
    When he grows up, pray, he's not going to say,
    “That teacher made me who I am today.”${prompt}
  7748: The Aurastery's School of Magic was creatively created to expansively expand the able abilities of child geniuses with the motto “Wisely, Strongly, Correctly.”${prompt}
  7749: Our skills guidance and testing promotively promote the “strongly” part of that motto. We truly appreciate your cooperative cooperation.${prompt}
  7750: Do your best to help us make this year's skills test as fair and square as we can. Improvisation is encouraged. The students can work in parties, and so can you.${prompt}
  7751: Be careful of the time limit, though. If I were you, I'd give myself about an hour to rush back to Mr. Moreno-Toeno.${prompt}
  7752: |-
    ......
    It doesn't matter whether we hold exams or not. I don't care how people assess me.${prompt}
  7753: Last year's skills test was held in Tahrongi Canyon. I wonder if this year's test will be held there, or on the Buburimu Peninsula...?${prompt}
  7754: During the skills test, two Cardians are assigned to each student. How you make your party members fight is an important factor in the exam.${prompt}
  7755: |-
    I can't wait.
    I'm good at skills tests.
    Fighting's what I do best!${prompt}
  7756: I heard you're gonna do the prep work for our skills test.${prompt}
  7757: Well, don't expect us to suck up to you. There are other candidates for test supervisor too, ya know.${prompt}
  7758: The whole class is abuzz about our skills test. But how come they all know so much?${prompt}
  7759: Am I the only one out of the loop?${prompt}
  7760: |-
    Heh-heh-heh.
    Our day of total black magic destruction has come, dude.${prompt}
  7761: |-
    Just you watch!
    It'll be like, BLAM! Those enemies will be blown sky-high! I'll get the five-star award if it's the last thing I do.${prompt}

    H-h-h-h-huh...

  7763: I'm having twouble-wouble with my study-wudies, so I came from the beginners class to ask the teacher-weachers here for helpy-welpy.${prompt}
  7764: But they all say the testy-westys are at handy-wandy, and are too busy-wusy to talky-walky. Won't someone just answer-wanser my simple-wimple question?${prompt}

    Go on, give it another go!${prompt}

    Well then, the next treacherous terrain to try will be the Buburimu Peninsula, I bet. But still, that will have to wait till we've time to kill.

    So sad, but too bad...

  7804: Uh-oh? What trouble did you get into? Don't tell me you're being sent to that scary-wary prison!${prompt}
  7805: Once that Sibyl Guard fixes her eyes on you, trying to deceive her is a waste of timey-wimey.${prompt}
  7806: Semih Lafihna is an especially close friend of the Star Sibyl. You better get a move on to Heavens Tower, or you'll be thrown in the Horutoto Ruins' jaily-waily!${prompt}
  7807: The Sibyl Guards who attend on the Star Sibyl are all Mithra.${prompt}
  7808: But they are different from the other Mithra you see around town. They have made a heartfelt pledge of allegiance.${prompt}
  7809: After the war, several Mithra cubs were sent to serve at Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  7810: By rights they should have been mere ladies-in-waiting, but by the Star Sibyl's grace, they were allowed to serve as special protectors of Heavens Tower. That's how the Sibyl Guards were born.${prompt}

  7816: Zubaba, the Star Sibyl's head lady-in-waiting, has issued another writ of summons for us to pass on to you.${prompt}
  7817: Sounds like she means business-wusiness. You'd better get a move on to Heavens Tower-wower!${prompt}

  7822: Ahhh...I wish I was born a girl so I could serve at the side of the great Sibyl. Not that serving by the side of Mokyokyo is bad or anything...${prompt}
  7823: According to the budding young ladies-in-waiting, the worst part about Heavens Tower is the mumbling-grumbling nagging of their head lady-in-waiting, Zubaba.${prompt}
  7824: I wonder why the older you get, the louder you grow. I guess you can't chew on things as well as you used to, so you bite at people instead.${prompt}

  7851: I heard from Mokyokyo that the talisman that sealed the Shadow Lord has been stolen!${prompt}
  7852: The talisman itself was supposed to be sealed away in the central tower of the Horutoto Ruins with a magical barrier protecting it, right!? The one who stole it must be an extremely powerful magician!${prompt}
  7853: Our fellow guards are currently checking whether the talismans sealed away in the other countries are safe or not.${prompt}

  7962: Well, of course I can't see anything during the day. I know-wow that! I'm just saving this space so nobody takes it during the day. Yawn...${prompt}
  7963: |-
    Nuah-ha-ha-ha... This is astronomical!
    It always amazes me how clearly-wearly we can see something so far away!${prompt}
  7964: Every star has its own name, just like we do! Doesn't that just make you have a closer affinity with them?${prompt}
  7965: |-
    Windurst is protected by the stars.
    Here at the Optistery, we record the position of the stars every night for posterity's sake.${prompt}
  7966: They say the Planetarium in Heavens Tower can display all the star formations of every age. I would love to have a look at it, but it'd probably be beyond my understanding.${prompt}
  7967: |-
    Things are a total blur lately...
    I'm having trouble focusing...${prompt}
  7968: For instance, take the constellation of Ifrit that shines in the northwest sky. I can see the bright red star and kind of make out the next brightest star, but that's about it.${prompt}
  7969: This telescope is really old, so perhaps it's the telescope and not me! It must be time to change its stellar mirror.${prompt}
  7970: But it's said the material needed to make stellar mirrors is only dropped by powerful monsters found in the Northlands. Now I'm in a fix...${prompt}
  7971: This telescope is really old, and it's about time to change its stellar mirror.${prompt}
  7972: But it's said the material needed to make stellar mirrors is only dropped by powerful monsters found in the Northlands. Now I'm in a fix! I'll have to reflect on the matter...${prompt}
  7973: The three telescopes found here are hundreds of years old and have become rather antiquated.${prompt}
  7974: Many a time there's been talk of rebuilding them, but we've not been able to do it yet.${prompt}
  7975: Just getting you hands on a crystal lens is hard enough, not to mention the other thingy-wingys you need.${prompt}
  7976: I bet our ancestors who made these telescopes didn't think they'd be in use hundreds of years later. Nor that their old worthless currency would be so valuable to us now.${prompt}
  7977: |-
    Ah! What's this?
    It can't really be ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, can it!?${prompt}
  7978: |-
    My stars!
    I was needing this to help me make a new stellar mirror for this telescope.${prompt}
  7979: My dear adventurer, would you be willing to help me remake this telescope's stellar mirror?${prompt}
  7980: 'To observe the stars properly, we first need to accurately inscribe the fundamental star positions onto this ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  7981: 'In order to do that, we need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}. These are the ancient shell coins made in the era of the first Star Sibyl.${prompt}'
  7982: There's hardly any of the old currency to be found these days, so it'll be a quite a job to find one of the precious coins.${prompt}
  7983: It would help me so much to have one of those old coins. I'd be willing to pay you back greatly, so please do your best to find me one.${prompt}
  7984: 'If only I had ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, I''d be able to inscribe the correct star positions onto the ${item-singular: 1[2]}. Otherwise, I won''t be able to make heads or tails of it.${prompt}'
  7985: I'm willing to pay you quite well, so please do your best to find me one.${prompt}
  7986: In olden days, pirates used the ancient Tarutaru money, which had the constellations drawn on them, to help them navigate by the stars...or so the folktales go.${prompt}
  7987: 'But now that most of the open seas have been charted into set shipping routes, they don''t need ${item-plural: 2[2]} anymore.${prompt}'
  7988: Hanging on to old money-woney is useless, as it soon loses its value.${prompt}
  7989: But then again, if it was sought after by our ancestors, I'm sure someone would find some kind of value in it these days. I wonder if anybody has some stashed away?${prompt}
  7990: Wow! I never thought you'd actually find one of these! What, did you travel back in time to ancient Windurst or something?${prompt}
  7991: Thank you so dearly! Now I can make a new stellar mirror for this telescope.${prompt}
  7992: I'm so in debt to you. Please accept this as a token of my appreciation...${prompt}
  7993: |-
    Oh then, Odin's to the north. Right and, Titan's to the south.
    Shivers, Shiva's to the east. And then, Leviathan's to the west.${prompt}
  7994: The mysterious legendary gods drawn on this coin are said to be the avatars that the first Star Sibyl had encountered.${prompt}
  7995: 'How did you manage to get your hands on ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}? I never thought we''d see one of those again!${prompt}'
  7996: |-
    Oh, I see... Wa-ha-ha!
    Those old buccaneers had some hidden away, eh? Even pirates come in useful at times too, huh?${prompt}
  7997: When you gaze at the night skies, you note stars of all different colors, right? Placed together, those stars form the constellations of the gods.${prompt}
  7998: The aqua-colored stars in the east sky that form the constellation of Shiva are so alluring... We astronomers like those stars the best.${prompt}
  7999: I never thought you'd actually find one of these! What, did you travel back in time to ancient Windurst or something?${prompt}
  8000: |-
    Huh? Hold on a second...
    This is a fake...!
    It's funny money!${prompt}
  8001: The positioning of the constellations isn't right on this coin. I guess you'll have to search harder to find a real one.${prompt}
  8002: That reminds me...I once read in an ancient scroll that there were too many forgeries of the old shell coins, so we Tarutaru abandoned them for gil instead.${prompt}
  8003: Please find me a coin with the correct positioning of the constellations on it.${prompt}
  8004: The real classical Tarutaru money has Odin drawn to the north, of course.${prompt}
  8005: You can'taru go having Odin on the east or west now, can you?${prompt}
  8006: Alexander shines bright and white in the northeastern sky. Titan's in the south and Leviathan's in the west.${prompt}
  8007: |-
    See him spread his imaginary wings there? Connect the stars together and you can make lots of shapes...
    Look! There's the great Onion in the sky!♪${prompt}
  8008: |-
    Whaddaya want-want?
    Can'tya see I'm busy-busy preparing for my astronomic observations?${prompt}
  8009: Hm. I infer somebody wants to see my stellar stellar map, perhaps?${prompt}
  8010: |-
    See the stellar map?
    ${selection-lines}
    Stellar!
    Map-schmap!${prompt}
  8011: Then don't bug-bug me again! People's lives are but a fleeting moment when compared to the lives of the stars. There are so many stars to map, I don't wanna waste a second second!${prompt}
  8012: |-
    Humph-humph.
    Good to see someone has an interest in the stars.${prompt}
  8013: Climbing the northern sky is the famous Odin. The black point there is Odin's beloved steer, Sleipnir.${prompt}
  8014: And above that--although in the actual night sky it appears below Sleipnir--is the North Star, the prominently bright star that sailors guide their ships by.${prompt}
  8015: If you want to further further your interest in the stars, then you're always welcome to visit here and see my stellar stellar map.${prompt}
  8016: |-
    This is the Rhinostery.
    We run a biological laboratory that uses magic to study all kinds of living things here.${prompt}
  8017: Some people mistakenly think we're just a botanical garden, but we study fauna as well as flora.${prompt}
  8018: It's just that we can't keep a zooful of animals here in the middle of town, right? So the staff here who specialize in zoology have to study out of town. That's why our minister, Rukususu, is out journeying right now.${prompt}
  8019: I...am...Kenapa-Keppa...${prompt}
  8020: Yeah...that's...my...erh...name...${prompt}

    Uh, excuse my tummy-grumbles.
    I'm utterly famished.${prompt}
  8032: But now is the critical point that will decide whether this project is a success or a total failure.${prompt}
  8033: I can't take my eyes off my work, so I can't move right now. Why, I can't even afford to sleep!${prompt}
  8034: |-
    Oooh... But I'm so hungry!
    I feel like I'm starving to death...${prompt}
  8035: Aagh! Nothing's left from the food I prepared in advance.${prompt}

  8040: <burp>... Well, excu～se me. As you can see, I'm not the slightest bit hungry...${prompt}
  8041: This room's the Rhinostery's meditation chamber. Say, I wonder how the manic work's going in the higgledy-piggledy laboratory next door.${prompt}
  8042: Huh? Their food supplies have run out so they say they're starving to death? Silly fools!${prompt}
  8043: Well, I've only just woke up, so I'm not going out to buy them anything.${prompt}
  8044: Why don't you go pick us up something, or even better, cook us up something? It should be an easy task for an adventurer such as you. Come on, show us what you're made of.${prompt}
  8045: |-
    Do a food run?
    ${selection-lines}
    Well, okay...
    No way!${prompt}
  8046: |-
    Too much of a bother, eh?
    Gee... For an adventurer, you sure don't like helping people out much.${prompt}
  8047: How can you sleep at night, knowing the lab staff could drop dead of starvation at any moment? It's just a simple walk to the shops or a little bit of cooking. Why won't you help out?${prompt}
  8048: |-
    Good, good! Thank you, finally.
    Very well, then...${prompt}
  8049: 'I''ll have ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}! They''re so finger-lickingly scrumptious.${prompt}'

    What do you take me for?
    It's pay on delivery, of course!${prompt}

    Thanks...
    Take this for your troubles...${prompt}
  8065: What's this?${prompt}
  8066: Humph. I guess this is what they mean when they say “Close is my shirt, but closer is my skin.” This'll have to do, then. So I'll take it.${prompt}
  8067: Of course, you're going to get Kenapa-Keppa and Kerutoto's orders as well, aren't you?${prompt}
  8068: Just hand each of them their orders directly. I'm sure they don't want to wait any more than they have to.${prompt}
  8069: Whoa! That's a surprise. How did you know what I wanted to eat?${prompt}
  8070: Well, I'm not complaining, just surprised. But seeing as you're giving it to me without my asking, I assume I don't have to pay, right?${prompt}

  8120: You've seen the flowers all over Windurst that serve as streetlights, right?${prompt}

  8144: What do you mean, you didn't steal it? It was passed around until it came to you?${prompt}
  8145: Well, now that it has fallen into your hands, you should return it to its rightful owner. I'm sure the poor old soul who lost this misses it greatly.${prompt}

  8171: Shh...! Can't you see I'm in the middle of transcribing this book here? Please keep your voice down!${prompt}
  8172: This is the manuscript room. This is where we carry out the transcription of the library's older books into new books.${prompt}
  8173: This copying of manuscripts has been repeated for hundreds of years. It is a work that never finishes.${prompt}
  8174: The books in this Library of Magic have special spells cast on them.${prompt}
  8175: Those spells only last a few hundred years or so. That's why we recast them with new magic. If we don't, the knowledge found within these books will perish.${prompt}
  8176: One of these ancient manuscripts has such extremely potent magic cast on it, it doesn't need to be transcribed over and over like this.${prompt}
  8177: This manuscript is called the “Book of the Gods.” It is a special book that only the Minister of the Optistery is allowed to handle.${prompt}
  8178: I'm going to read as many books as I can. With all that knowledge, I can become valedictorian of the School of Magic!${prompt}
  8179: Then when I graduate, I'll enter one of the ministries, work my way up to minister, then become a professor when I retire.${prompt}
  8180: Adults are always telling us not to say unchildish things. But we youths have to know the so-called workings of this world if we're going to survive.${prompt}
  8181: If you go too slow, you'll be left behind in this ever-changing world of ours.${prompt}
  8182: |-
    Hrrrrm...
    That can't be it...
    Then again...
    Hr-hr-hr-hrmm...${prompt}
  8183: |-
    Hrm!
    Hey, you're the adventurer from the other day!
    I don't believe it!
    I don't believe a word anyone says!${prompt}
  8184: |-
    Hr-hr-hr-hrmm...
    Thanks to some adventurer somewhere, I was able to awaken from an inescapable nightmare.${prompt}
  8185: The resurrection of the Shadow Lord and the Book of the Gods losing its magic... Those things couldn't possibly happen. It was all but a dream...${prompt}
  8186: "Shh...! \nCan't you see I'm in the middle of transcribing this book here? Please keep your voice down!${prompt}"
  8187: “Heretofore, source of magick...primarily extrinsic energies...fill terra and caelum.”${prompt}
  8188: “Tarutaru...analyzed...extrinsic energy...classifying into eight...elements. These...give birth magick...resides in soul...woven into spells...both...er, both...”${prompt}
  8189: '...What''s this?${prompt}'
  8190: I don't know how to read this glyph. That's the trouble with ancient writings; the letters and characters are too hard to read...${prompt}
  8191: |-
    Hey, you there!
    You wouldn't happen to be passing through West Sarutabaruta anytime soon, would you? If so, I have a little favor to ask...${prompt}
  8192: |-
    Listen to Hariga-Origa's request?
    ${selection-lines}
    Listen.
    Don't listen.${prompt}
  8193: Well, I guess it can't be helped then... I'll just have to give up until someone can go there for me.${prompt}
  8194: One of our researchers just headed off to the Horutoto Ruins in West Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  8195: She specializes in paleography, so she should be able to read these glyphs with no trouble at all.${prompt}
  8196: Could you do me a favor and pass her this memo? Her name is Ipupu.${prompt}
  8197: Hurry up and pass that memo to Ipupu. She's in West Sarutabaruta, probably in one of the magic towers of the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt}
  8198: Until I can read the glyph I wrote in that memo, I have to give up... But I can't rest now, as I have so many other books to do. Guess I'll just have to get on with them in the meantime.${prompt}
  8199: The transcription of these manuscripts is so bothersome. It's impossible to read the ancient letters, and if you make a little mistake in their pronunciation, BOOM! The whole book goes and explodes in your face.${prompt}
  8200: But if you avoid the old books, you'll only have more trouble when it comes to reading the ancient writings. You just can't win.${prompt}
  8201: Lately Ipupu has been transcribing some ancient scrolls regarding the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt}
  8202: So my guess is that she's headed for the central tower of the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt}
  8203: Oh, welcome back. Were you able to get any feedback from Ipupu?${prompt}
  8204: |-
    Hu-hum... So, this glyph just has the meaning of “sanative”? Why didn't they just write “healing,” for crying out loud?
    Anyway, so where was I...${prompt}
  8205: “Heretofore, the source of magick was primarily the extrinsic energies that fill terra and caelum.”${prompt}
  8206: “The Tarutaru had analyzed that extrinsic energy, classifying it into eight elements. These elements give birth to magick that resides in the soul to be woven into spells both sanative and hostile.”${prompt}
  8207: “However, after many long years of study, the existence of a converse of extrinsic energy, intrinsic energy from the soul itself, was discovered.”${prompt}
  8208: |-
    Phew!
    This book is way too complicated. I think I'll leave it here for today...${prompt}
  8209: Oh, that's right, I had better reward you with something for helping me out there. Let me see... How about this map I have here? I'm sure you'll find this useful in your adventures!${prompt}
  8210: Let me see... What was that book about? Something to do with extrinsic energy and the soul's own intrinsic energy...?${prompt}
  8211: That reminds me of something I heard in one of my lessons at the School of Magic... Magic from the heart that uses the soul's energy is what gave birth to magic dolls and automaton guards.${prompt}
  8212: |-
    Hrmm.
    Hey you! What are you doing there?${prompt}
  8213: |-
    Hrmm!?
    Just a second... I could use you. Would you be willing to do a little chore for me in return for some money?${prompt}
  8214: |-
    Take on the chore?
    ${selection-lines}
    Accept.
    Decline.${prompt}
  8215: "You don't need the cash? Hah! \nJust goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover, then... Anyway, I'm busy, so off with you!${prompt}"
  8216: "Good! \nFirst, let me explain a bit about our distinguished library.${prompt}"
  8217: "Wha-wha-wha-what???\nYou don't need me to tell you?\nYou already know? \nHr-hr-hr-hrmm...${prompt}"
  8218: This library's official name is the Federal Book Repository for Magical Knowledge and Research...${prompt}
  8219: Also known as the Book Repository of General Knowledges. It is under the jurisdiction of the Optistery, the ministry that forbids the loss of knowledge.${prompt}
  8220: Under the strict supervision of successive ministers, our Optistery has protected the knowledge stored here with a system that doesn't allow even a baby ant to go unaccounted for.${prompt}
  8221: For instance, the diary that disappears into blank pages after three days, or the housekeeping account book that's so red, it makes your eyes weep.${prompt}
  8222: Once a book or scroll is placed in our care, we will never allow its content to be lost.${prompt}
  8223: Hrmm... However...several misfortunes have thrown the wheels of fate into disorder.${prompt}
  8224: We want you to hunt down those books that have suffered such a sad fate, and bring them back to us.${prompt}
  8225: Ask the librarian at the counter, Furakku-Norakku, for the details. We're counting on you, the savior of knowledge!${prompt}
  8226: Hrm? Wha-wha-what's wrong? Are you fulfilling your role as the savior of knowledge?${prompt}
  8227: |-
    Huh...?
    Savior of knowledge?${prompt}
  8228: Oh...you mean the overdue book collector's job, right? Great. We need all the help we can get.${prompt}
  8229: |-
    Let me see...
    This week, the following book is overdue...${prompt}
  8230: 'Some Hume named Orn still has the book ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} out on loan.${prompt}'
  8231: First, ask around town to track the borrower down, hand him this card, get the book from him, and return it to me here.${prompt}
  8232: |-
    Well, good luck.
    Phew... That's one less chore to do.${prompt}
  8233: |-
    Huh? You forgot?
    You're supposed to be getting the overdue book, ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, back from a Hume named Orn.${prompt}
  8234: |-
    A Hume named Orn?
    Why would we know that? If it doesn't appear in our exams, then it's not worth learning!${prompt}
  8235: You should ask adults such trivial questions. They have more time on their handy-wandies.${prompt}
  8236: There's an adult who spends all day sitting in the tavern.${prompt}
  8237: He's a reporter for the “Magic Paradise Weekly.” He boasts that nothing goes on in Windurst Waters without him knowing about it.${prompt}
  8238: |-
    Munch-munch...chew-chew...
    What's that? You have a question you want to ask me, the walking library?${prompt}
  8239: |-
    Oh, that's easy-weasy.
    Orn, the Hume gentleman you're referring to, is a traveler who's staying in the hostelry room right above us.${prompt}
  8240: You disturbed my custard, cake, and jelly for such a trifling matter? Munch-munch...chew-chew...${prompt}
  8241: Who are you?${prompt}
  8242: 'Ah! Oh, no, ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}? Gosh, I''ve been meaning to tell them...${prompt}'
  8243: I don't know how to say this, but...I kinda lost the library book I borrowed...${prompt}
  8244: I was on my way back to Mhaura when I was attacked by some Yagudo beastmen. In my desperation to escape, I started to throw my belongings at them...${prompt}
  8245: '...Including that library book! I was intending to return to Mhaura and raise some money to take back to the library...${prompt}'
  8246: '...so I was wondering, could you ask the librarians to give me a little extension on the due date?${prompt}'
  8247: Some guy told me that the stuff the Yagudo steal is massed in the treasure chamber in the depths of Giddeus... But I can't exactly walk in there and get it now, can I?${prompt}
  8248: Yagudo are smarter than your average monster, and tend to be downright vicious.${prompt}
  8249: |-
    Huah...!
    What to do when you lose one of our books?${prompt}
  8250: If that's the case, you've just lost an important national treasure! You can't just pay money to get out of it. You'll be sent to scary-wary prison! Just the thought gives me the shiver-wivers...${prompt}
  8251: |-
    Anyway, you shouldn't be asking that.
    Hurry up and get ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} back off of him. I sure hope he hasn't lost it...!${prompt}
  8252: That book you've got there!? Don't tell me you went all the way into the nest of the Yagudo in Giddeus!${prompt}
  8253: What a courageous person you are! I can't believe you convinced the Yagudo to give the book back! I'm truly impressed!${prompt}
  8254: Sorry to ask, seeing as you went out of your way and all, but...could you be so good as to return it to the Library of Magic for me?${prompt}
  8255: I can't possibly show my face in there ever again!${prompt}
  8256: |-
    Huaaah...?
    Oh, you got our overdue library book back?${prompt}
  8257: Ah, but look at the poor thingy-wingy. It's been all ripped up and dirtied. I wonder what hideously hideous thing happened to it?${prompt}
  8258: |-
    Here you go... This is for your troubles.
    Let's do this again sometime!
    The pleasure was mine, entirely...${prompt}
  8259: |-
    Let's do the lost book retrieval again sometime, eh?
    Sorry, at the moment I'm all booked out! Huaaah... ZZZzzz...${prompt}
  8260: |-
    Hrm.
    I hear another book crying somewhere...
    Hrrrmmmmmm...${prompt}
  8261: If your journeys seem to have lost purpose of late, why not help out my ministry in your capacity as the “savior of knowledge” again?${prompt}
  8262: |-
    Help out the library again?
    ${selection-lines}
    Listen to offer.
    Don't.${prompt}
  8263: |-
    Let me see... Oh yeah...
    This week we have the following unreturned book...${prompt}
  8264: Hae Jakkya from the Windurst Woods auction house.${prompt}
  8265: 'She''s still got the book ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} out on loan. Erch... That''s one of those hot and steamy, mushy and slushy, love romance novels.${prompt}'
  8266: |-
    Huh? You forgot?
    It's Hae Jakkya, who runs the auction house in The Windurst Woods.${prompt}
  8267: 'She''s got a romance novel out called ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} that is now overdue. Please get it back for us, okay?${prompt}'
  8268: Ask Furakku-Norakku, librarian at the counter there, for the details. We're counting on you, the savior of knowledge!${prompt}
  8269: |-
    Did you know...?
    They say that everyone in this world has at least one other person who looks exactly like them.${prompt}
  8270: So that means there's another Kotan-Moritan who looks exactly like me out there somewhere! Man, that's pretty cool when you think about it.${prompt}
  8271: Mithra names are so hard to pronounce with all those h's and stuff. I can't remember them at all.${prompt}
  8272: But it's okay, because I have the perfect system. You just call them all “Miss” all the time. But no matter how old they are, never call them “Missus,” “Lady,” or “Granny”...they don't seem to like that.${prompt}
  8273: |-
    Huh?
    What do you mean, she says she didn't borrow it? It says so right here...${prompt}
  8274: But come to think of it, she doesn't seem the type to borrow such a tacky book. This is strange.${prompt}
  8275: But look, it says Hae Jakhya right here on the borrower's card...${prompt}
  8276: |-
    Huaaaah...?
    You found that overdue book?${prompt}
  8277: Huh? Someone with almost the exact same name had it out on loan? Hm... Same diff...${prompt}
  8278: Anyway, here's your payment, bucko. See you around next time, I s'pose...${prompt}
  8279: "I'll talk to you next time we have an unreturned book to fetch. Till then... \nHuaaah... ZZZzzz...${prompt}"
  8280: Hae Jakkya from Windurst Woods' auction house? I remember now... She's a regular here. Never had a late book in her life.${prompt}
  8281: If only all the Mithra were as diligent as she is. But don't get me started with my grumblings...${prompt}
  8282: "Shh...! \nCan't you see I'm in the middle of transcribing this book? Please keep your voice down!${prompt}"
  8283: There are many books and scrolls preserved in Windurst, but the most important one, with the highest historical value, is the ”Book of the Gods.“${prompt}
  8284: The “Book of the Gods” is tightly guarded in innermost chambers of the Optistery. We don't know for sure what is contained in it or who wrote it.${prompt}
  8285: As for this book, in the past it had been handed to the Yagudo by some wicked person. The scholar who retrieved the book back was able to reveal one of its secrets to us.${prompt}
  8286: Just a second...?${prompt}
  8287: |-
    My word!
    What are these brown smudges here? Thanks to these, I can't read the essential first page!${prompt}
  8288: |-
    Hey, you again!
    You wouldn't be able to fetch me ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, would you? If I have both of them, I'll be able to clean away these smudges, leaving these pages as good as new!${prompt}
  8289: |-
    Accept request for help?
    ${selection-lines}
    Listen further.
    Decline.${prompt}
  8290: Well, I guess it can't be helped, then... I'll just have to give up until someone can get some for me.${prompt}
  8291: 'I''ve heard that ${item-plural: 1[2]} can be obtained from the monsters in Ordelle''s Caves. It''s pretty far, but hey, you''re an adventurer, aren''t you?${prompt}'
  8292: 'I''ve heard that ${item-plural: 1[2]} can be obtained from the monsters in Ordelle''s Caves.${prompt}'
  8293: 'If we can get ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} too, then we''ll be able to wipe away those smudges in a jiffy. Good luck in finding them.${prompt}'
  8294: |-
    Umm... Where was I... Umm...
    Oh, I just can't concentrate... I'm too worried about Hariga-Origa's work.${prompt}
  8295: 'If only I had ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} to give him... Oh, can''taru you hurry up and find him some so we can erase the stains and get that book back to its rightaruful place?${prompt}'
  8296: Serukoko's not getting much transcription work done today.${prompt}
  8297: She usually works so fast that we can't make out what she's saying! Perhaps she went too fast and tired herself outaru?${prompt}
  8298: |-
    Oh, welcome back.
    Great. Now that I have these, we're set!${prompt}
  8299: |-
    Here we go...
    Squeak, squeak, squeak...
    Swish, swish, swish!♪${prompt}
  8300: |-
    Look! See how clean it is!
    Huh?
    What the...?
    Oh, my word!${prompt}
  8301: The “Book of the Gods” is tightly guarded in the innermost parts of the Optistery. We do not know for sure what is contained in it, nor who wrote it.${prompt}
  8302: As for this book... In the past, some wicked person had handed it to the Yagudo. The scholar who retrieved the book was able to reveal one of its secrets to us.${prompt}
  8303: Wondering why the writing in the “Book of the Gods” doesn't need transcribing? It's because the writing is penned with water from the Full Moon Fountain!${prompt}
  8304: Only the Star Sibyl can enter the Full Moon Fountain... Oh...does that mean the author is actually...???${prompt}
  8305: |-
    Yikes...! Oh, my word! Oh my word!
    I just realized...this is a restricted book! It's forbidden to move it, let alone transcribe it!!!${prompt}
  8306: What in heaven's name is a restricted book doing here!? As soon as I start reading its contents aloud, I'm going to be caught for sure!${prompt}
  8307: |-
    Hey, you...
    Here, I'll give you this, so keep this whole incident quiet! Promise not to tell anyone, okay?${prompt}
  8308: |-
    Eww...
    What if those smudges I removed from the book were bloodstains...?${prompt}
  8309: Ooo-ah! Perhaps that was the famed blood-sucking book of yore!? Shivers! Thank goodness it wasn't hungry, otherwise it could have attacked me!${prompt}
  8310: |-
    Umm... Where was I... Umm...
    Oh, I can't concentrate because I'm so worried! I hope Hariga-Origa can hurry up and get rid of that stain from my little juice-spilling incident.${prompt}
  8311: Now I wish I never listened to the Minister of the Orastery's request. Oh, I'm too weak when it comes to assertive men...${prompt}
  8312: Oh, so you want to know a little about magic, huh?${prompt}
  8313: Well, you've come to the right place. We can teach you the basics...${prompt}
  8314: |-
    Listen to their explanation?
    ${selection-lines}
    Decline.
    Accept.${prompt}
  8315: |-
    Well then, let us explain...
    There are basically two types of magic...white and black.${prompt}
  8316: White magic is predominately used for healing. It is what white mages specialize in. White magic includes healing spells such as Cure, and Poisona, which removes poison status...${prompt}
  8317: High-level white mages can use Raise to revive fallen comrades.${prompt}
  8318: Then there's black magic...${prompt}
  8319: Hey, leave the explanation of black magic to me!${prompt}
  8320: Black magic is used mainly for attacking. As you can tell from their names, black mages are pros at casting black magic.${prompt}
  8321: Black magic has a strong connection to the elements, the magic power abundant in nature. That's why there are spells called Fire and Thunder, which correspond to the elements of fire and lightning.${prompt}
  8322: |-
    Black magic is the best.
    Whenever you say “magic-user,” you immediately think of black mages, right?${prompt}
  8323: Hold on there! Aren't the two of you forgetting a particularly important kind of magic? Magic isn't just about attacking things and healing people. Listen, and let me explain...${prompt}
  8324: Do you know about enhancement magic? Spells such as Enfire and Phalanx can be cast on weapons and armor, adding a temporary magical aura to them.${prompt}
  8325: To use such enhancement spells, you have to study both black and white magic.${prompt}
  8326: |-
    That's why red mages are the best!
    Not only can you use both kinds of magic, but you can cast it on your weapons and stuff! Red mages always come in handy!${prompt}
  8327: Oh yeah? But red mages can only use a little bit of black and white magic. I'd call them “monochrome” at best! They're so limited!${prompt}
  8328: |-
    Calm down, guys...
    Cool it!${prompt}
  8329: |-
    So, how about it?
    Do you understand more about magic now? We're currently studying the basics here at the School of Magic.${prompt}
  8330: Actually, there is one more type of magic that is forbidden now, but I guess that doesn't concern an adventurer such as yourself. Anyway, good luck with your magic studies. Bye-bye.${prompt}
  8331: |-
    I never thought when I was a wee child
    I'd grow up to be a teacher reviled.${prompt}
  8332: |-
    My pet theory in my childhood, I stated,
    was that “studying is overrated!”${prompt}
  8333: |-
    But now my pet theory is, I'm fated,
    that rather “teaching is overrated!”${prompt}
  8334: This semester's students, you see, differ tremendously in ability. It's a pretty perplexing problem!${prompt}
  8335: Aim at the able adolescent, and the late-learners are left lagging.${prompt}
  8336: Lower the level and lo...the superiority and selectness of the students this school sends out suffer. How my haggard head hurts!${prompt}
  8337: Every student is differently different. Unless one strives to understandingly understand each individual, one cannot educatedly educate in the fullest sense of the word.${prompt}
  8338: At the very least, one should try to rememberingly remember their students' names... I'm not pointedly pointing the finger at anyone in particular here, but...${prompt}
  8339: The School of Magic's system of “determining your future while you are young” is quite practical, really.${prompt}
  8340: You don't have to fear an uncertain future, leaving you to enjoy the freedom of your youth. That way, you won't have any regrets as you get older, saying “I wish I had more fun as a kid...”${prompt}
  8341: Today we will brush up on our level ten-and-above black magic spells.${prompt}
  8342: School is a lot more fun than I expected. I'm glad I listened to my mother and enrolled here.${prompt}
  8343: I made a lot of friends, and learning's fun when we're together.${prompt}
  8344: Where's our teacher, you ask? The teachers are all in the staff room, of course!${prompt}
  8345: In the advanced grade, we learn by ourselves and only go ask the teachers for help when we don't understand something.${prompt}
  8346: We refer to the schedules the teachers prepare for us, but we decide by ourselves which magic we should learn next, and how many days we should spend on it.${prompt}
  8347: I'm Koko Lihzeh, the School of Magic's first Mithra student.${prompt}
  8348: I'm studying real hard so I can prrrove that Mithra can become as skilled as anyone else in the use of magic.${prompt}
  8349: Tsk. Don't tell me another adventurer has wandered into our class with eyes wide open in wonder...${prompt}
  8350: I know our school is liberal and open to all and all that, but I don't see why that means any ill-mannered trespasser can walk in and disturb our studies.${prompt}
  8351: Here at the School of Magic, we've got famous teachers who excel in all the fields of magic. There's Ms. Fuepepe, who specializes in black magic, Mr. Pechiru-Mashiru, an expert in white magic, and Mr. Moreno-Toeno, who's a master in red enhancement magic.${prompt}
  8352: Too bad each teacher has conflicting policies and methods of teaching. It sucks, 'cause us students are always confused over who to believe and what to do.${prompt}
  8353: |-
    Heh-heh-heh.
    I, like, totally dig our black magic lessons, dude! They look so cool and have such wicked effects...those black mages' robes really rule!${prompt}
  8354: When I graduate, I wanna enter the Orastery's Mage Academy. But it's the most popular ministry to go into. The position usually goes to the kid who gets the best grades. Dammit...${prompt}
  8355: Our class's overachiever is Kirarara. She's the smarty-pants standing up there behind the lectern.${prompt}
  8356: Aaargh! I, I, I still d-don't understand these at all! A-a-after a-all that pr-preparation...<sniff>${prompt}
  8357: If you think of it as studying, then it's no fun, right? So pretend it's a memory game and...oh, what if you forget to pretend?${prompt}
  8358: It's not that we in the beginners class can't do magic properly... It's just that those guys in the advanced class are too good at casting them spells.${prompt}
  8359: It's true that you can only improve magic with plenty of practice. But the first step is to study a multitude of difficult books.${prompt}
  8360: In order to read such tricky books, you have to have a sense of magic in the first place. It's kinda hard to explain, but it's like an ingrained feeling you just have.${prompt}
  8361: I'm having twouble-wouble with my study-wudies, so I came from the beginners class to ask the teacher-weachers here for helpy-welpy.${prompt}
  8362: But all the teachers-weachers say it's not their field of study-wudy, so I should asky-wasky another teacher-weacher. Is this what you call “giving someone the wunawound”?${prompt}
  8363: Hey, how dare you there! You mustn't touch my teaching materials!${prompt}
  8364: Huff! I don't have enough stuff as it is. Fumble-mumble-grumble...${prompt}
  8365: |-
    Hey, you'll do!
    Can I ask you to do a tiny task, too?${prompt}
  8366: |-
    Hear his humble mumble?

    Listlessly listen.
    Downright decline.${prompt}
  8367: Please part promptly. Dumbly dawdling there is damned distracting!${prompt}
  8368: I lack the indispensable items essential for my important lesson!${prompt}
  8369: Seems the sum of students is the same, but the number of them making mistakes has multiplied. The level of the little learners lowers every year lately...${prompt}
  8370: 'Anyway, attempt to acquire ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  8371: 'Actually, acquiring ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} is amazingly arduous. But I best beg and beseech you, then bid you bye-bye!${prompt}'
  8372: 'Obtain one ${item-singular: 1[2]} and one ${item-singular: 2[2]} or I''ll obstinately run out of replacements.${prompt}'
  8373: At last I can conduct a comely class!${prompt}
  8374: |-
    Right...regarding your reward...
    Sorry it's not so stately a sum,
    but some is better than none...${prompt}
  8375: This semester's students, you will see, differ tremendously in capability. It's a pretty perplexing problem!${prompt}
  8376: Aim at the able adolescent and the late-learners are left lagging.${prompt}
  8377: Lower the level and lo...the superiority and selectness of the students this school sends out suffers. How my haggard head hurts!${prompt}
  8378: My dear adventurer... are you busy now? I have a problematic problem you may be able to help me with.${prompt}
  8379: This is a matter that could sully our school's reputable reputation, so it is rather hard to ask, but... Yesterday, we had a burglary at our staff room here.${prompt}
  8380: The only thing stolen was a pile of students' answer sheets. If it is possibly possible, I'd be greatly grateful if you could find them and bring them back to me.${prompt}
  8381: |-
    Helpfully help the teacher out?
    ${selection-lines}
    Acceptingly accept.
    Decliningly decline.${prompt}
  8382: I don't care who stolidly stole them. I just want my students' test answers back. Please help me.${prompt}
  8383: I need to check the answers and see where each and every one of my students went wrong.${prompt}
  8384: '......${prompt}'
  8385: |-
    It's my faulty fault.
    I should never have left them on my desk when I went outside. There's no forgiving my negligent negligence.${prompt}
  8386: Please bring back the answer papers to me. Without them, I can't gradually grade my students. Learning starts from recognizably recognizing one's mistakes, you know?${prompt}
  8387: What kind of person would pilfer Ms. Fuepepe's papers?${prompt}
  8388: What would anyone want with them?${prompt}
  8389: |-
    Tests are a load of mumbo jumbo, you bet!
    Even if the students cram for an exam, I regret,
    the moment it's over they all but everything forget.${prompt}
  8390: |-
    A bit like life. And you ask why?
    You strive and strive, and then you die!
    And everyone forgets you. <sigh!>${prompt}
  8391: Yesterday, a student from the advanced class named Chomoro-Kyotoro came looking for Ms. Fuepepe.${prompt}
  8392: I wonder if he finally met Ms. Fuepepe? When I came back to my counter, he was already gone.${prompt}
  8393: |-
    Test papers?
    What has that got to do with this lesson?${prompt}
  8394: I'm pretty confident about my results for the written exam. In fact, I think I did better than Kirarara!${prompt}
  8395: But poor Chomoro-Kyotoro is in hot water. If he gets less than 50%, it's back to the beginners class for him.${prompt}
  8396: If I get above an 80% on the written test we had the other day, I'm gonna get a new wand!${prompt}
  8397: But it's taking an awful long time for the test results to come back. I wonder what's taking so long?${prompt}
  8398: Oww! I'm sure I totally failed my test. I forget everything as soon as I'm put under pressure.${prompt}
  8399: If only I had thirty minutes more, I could have taken my time and relaxed a little.${prompt}
  8400: I expect to get about 50%... That's 'cause I chose by intuition...not tuition.${prompt}
  8401: But I got 90% in the test before last, so I don't have to worrrry about dropping down to beginnerrrs class.${prompt}
  8402: Argh! Don't speak to me about that written test. I failed it totally, dude.${prompt}
  8403: Once that test comes back, they're gonna make me study like crazy. Ahh...I wish that test would never come back!${prompt}
  8404: During the test the other day, Chomoro-Kyotoro was as white as a moogle. I wonder what kinda results he's gonna get?${prompt}
  8405: |-
    But I'm not worried, myself.
    I'm on easy street!${prompt}
  8406: I-I-I'm pretty confident too, you know? I, I bet I'll get over 50%!${prompt}
  8407: But, it's gre...I mean, too bad the results aren't coming back, huh? A-he-he-he-he...${prompt}
  8408: Oh, looky-look at the answer sheets! They're all so tattered and torn. Why, I can't make heads or tails out of them.${prompt}
  8409: But at least they're back in our possessive possession. Say, could you take them to the principal for me?${prompt}
  8410: Please take the answer sheets to the principal. Thankingly thanking you.${prompt}
  8411: '...Oh dearie-dear? Don''t tell me you don''t knowingly know who the principal is? Why, I thought everyone knew he was the eccentrically eccentric old man who livenly lives in a manor in Windurst Walls.${prompt}'
  8412: |-
    H-huh...!?
    You, you found the answer sheets!?${prompt}
  8413: |-
    ......
    R-really?
    All the answer sheets?
    A-a-are you sure...?${prompt}
  8414: Goodness gracious! Chomoro-Kyotoro's answer paper was missing? My, isn't that strangely strange? Why, I counted them myself and was surely sure there was one from every student.${prompt}
  8415: I guessingly guess it can't be helped then... We'll just have to make young master Chomoro-Kyotoro sit the test again.${prompt}
  8416: He was a little under the weather last examination, so I hope his effortful efforts since then bear fruit and his resultant results this time 'round are better.${prompt}
  8417: Here is your requitable requital. I hope you find it satisfactorily satisfactory. Thank you for your assisting assistance.${prompt}
  8418: The principal himself has had the experienced experience of failing the grade and being sent down a class...quite a few timely times too, I may addingly add.${prompt}
  8419: On the surface he appears inscrutably inscrutable, irresponsibly irresponsible and absurdly absurd, but he's actually considerately considerate, you know.${prompt}
  8420: |-
    Huh? Wh-wh-what's that?
    The principal said I should have this?${prompt}
  8421: '!!!${prompt}'
  8422: |-
    ......
    ...I-I'm sorry!
    Sorry for the trouble, I caused you. I-I promise I'll never do it again!${prompt}
  8423: |-
    ...
    I-I-I promise I'll never do such a thing again!${prompt}
  8424: I-I'll never throw this answer sheet away again. I-I now know you have to learn from your mistakes...${prompt}
  8425: Hey, are you busy?${prompt}

    Busy...?
    ${selection-lines}
    No. Just a busybody.
    Yes. Busy as a bee!${prompt}
  8427: Well then, buzz off!${prompt}
  8428: Good, 'cause I have a favor to ask!${prompt}
  8429: The other day, Mr. Moreno-Toeno gave us a homework assignment on the cultivation of plants.${prompt}
  8430: I've got better things to do with my time than watch grass grow. I'd prefer to ask someone like you, who's not busy, to do it for me.${prompt}
  8431: |-
    Help out with your green thumb?
    ${selection-lines}
    Thumbs up!
    Thumbs down!${prompt}
  8432: Gee... It's not like I'm asking for an arm and a leg, or something. That's why I hate adults!${prompt}
  8433: 'Great! Thanks. Then go plant ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} in a flowerpot for me, and check on them once a day until they grow into something that''ll impress everyone.${prompt}'
  8434: 'Just telling you...I''m out to impress. You''ve got to grow at least ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, or else I''m not paying you anything for your help, all right?${prompt}'
  8435: 'For me to be top of the class, then you''ll at least need to grow ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} from ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, okay?${prompt}'
  8436: Don't think I'll be cheap just 'coz I'm a kid. I'll reward you on how good a gardener you are.${prompt}
  8437: |-
    Homework?
    What has that got to do with you?${prompt}
  8438: The advanced class has been given a gardening homework assignment. It's used for experimenting on how the elements of crystals affect potted plants.${prompt}
  8439: 'I was given grain seeds, so hopefully it will grow into ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. But if it dies, does that make me a cereal killer?${prompt}'
  8440: Gardening is so easy, even gnomes could do it! All you have to do is throw the seeds into a pot and forget about them, right?${prompt}
  8441: |-
    Whaddaya mean I'm wrong?
    So, I need to cast some spell on it or something? What, like “Open Sesame” or something?${prompt}
  8442: "Oh～w! \nI got some vegetable seeds...${prompt}"
  8443: 'I hope they don''t grow into ${item-plural: 1[2]}. I just abhor that vegetable!${prompt}'
  8444: Our horticultural homework is required for the runts to realize the Rhinostery's remarkable role. Plus, it helps us pick which pupils have a particular talent in that area for recommendation to the Rhinostery.${prompt}
  8445: When you grow the plant in a flowerpot and feed it a crystal at just the right time, you'll get a different result.${prompt}
  8446: 'I rrreceived frrruit seeds! I''ll trrry and grrrow some ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  8447: I, I, I thought growing p-plants was supposed to be easy. L-l-like they just g-grow by themselves, r-right?${prompt}
  8448: B-but I let mine b-be and they d-dried up! It's actually r-r-really hard!${prompt}
  8449: I didn't tell you the due date, so I thought you wouldn't make it in time...${prompt}
  8450: |-
    What in Vana'diel is this?
    Is this all you could grow?
    I'll get a zero for this! Zilch!${prompt}
  8451: Didn't you study agriculture when you were a kid? The goal isn't just to stop the plant from withering, you know? I guess that's why you became an adventurer, huh? Oh～w!${prompt}
  8452: Humph! You only brought me what I asked for... I guess it would have been expecting too much for anything more than that, huh? Stick to adventuring next time...${prompt}
  8453: I wonder if I'll ever get the chance to meet a higher-level adventurer?${prompt}
  8454: Being stuck in this School of Magic all day means I don't get to meet many people.${prompt}
  8455: |-
    Wow! Well done!
    What kinda crystal did you feed it to grow something like this?${prompt}
  8456: I might even be able to beat Kirarara with this. You deserve every gil of your reward!${prompt}
  8457: With this, I'll be able to beat Kirarara at last! But, wait... What if Kirarara also got an adventurer to help her with her homework, too?${prompt}
  8458: What's wrong with asking others to do the stuff you can't do yourself?${prompt}
  8459: It's much more efficient, and if you pay them a proper reward, then you both benefit. This is the ideology that keeps the world turning.${prompt}
  8460: But Mr. Moreno-Toeno must be the only one who doesn't know that. Anyway, that's the reason why I'm having you help with my horticultural homework again.${prompt}
  8461: I assume it's not appropriate to articulate this at an adventurer such as yourself, but...${prompt}
  8462: Lately there's a lamentable lad who asks adventurers to arrange his homework for him. He worries me greatly!${prompt}
  8463: If one overly relies on others, then when there isn't anyone around to assist you, you run aground! One needs to stand on one's own two feet.${prompt}
  8464: <Nod...nod...doze...>${prompt}
  8465: I'm soo sleepy, dude... I'm falling asleep on my feet here...${prompt}
  8466: "...Huh!? \n<Yawn!>\nWhat do you want?\nStop bugging me!${prompt}"
  8467: <Nod...nod...doze...>${prompt}
  8468: Paku-Nakku's attitude to learning is so bad. He's always half-asleep in class lately.${prompt}
  8469: His consistent yawning gets on my nerves. If only there was some spell to stop yawning, I'd soon fix him!${prompt}
  8470: Falling asleep in class shows you lack excitement and motivation in your daily life.${prompt}
  8471: When he wakes up, the next thing Paku-Nakku will know is that he's been dropped down into the beginners class!${prompt}
  8472: That has nothing to do with me.${prompt}
  8473: That magic that Paku-Nakku showed off during practical training at the Orastery was really something!${prompt}
  8474: But if the Orastary staff finds out, he'll get a real scolding!${prompt}
  8475: What's up with Paku-Nakku? He's always dropping off to sleep in class lately.${prompt}
  8476: He's usually the rowdiest one in class! I wonder if he's okay.${prompt}
  8477: Durrring our magical prrractice the otherrr day, Paku-Nakku and Foi-Mui brrroke the rrrules and got extra homeworrrk as punishment.${prompt}
  8478: I don't underrrstand why boys love to do forrrbidden stuff all the time.${prompt}
  8479: I, I w-wonder how c-come Paku-Nakku c-can use all those d-different magic w-wands so w-well?${prompt}
  8480: I-is h-he a n-natural b-born g-genius? I, I, I w-wish I w-was m-more l-like h-him!!${prompt}
  8481: |-
    Hey, what's that you say?
    Paku-Nakku just sleeps all day?${prompt}
  8482: |-
    That's strange indeed, I tell you...!
    The Sleep spell cast on Paku-Nakku
    should have worn off by now, too.${prompt}
  8483: An accident occurring during a precarious practical at the Orastery's Mage Academy? This is true? Tsk, that's terrible! For one of our students to be so capriciously careless...${prompt}
  8484: |-
    A teacher must take trouble to be true to their task. Sounds like some seriously slack supervision!
    That's through and through, one of Mr. Pechiru-Mashiru's lessons for you...${prompt}
  8485: |-
    An accident with a Wand of Sleep...!?
    The other teachers said that? Oh *bleep*!${prompt}
  8486: |-
    Magic practice at the Mage Academy is just tough luck!
    There's always one or two kids who run amuck!
    Put yourself in my position...I'm a sitting duck!${prompt}
  8487: It's rather hard to say that Mr. Pechiru-Mashiru is respectingly respected by his studious students, let alone his peerless peers!${prompt}
  8488: He should take a hardy hard look at himself as an educated educator.${prompt}
  8489: '......${prompt}'
  8490: '...Huh...?${prompt}'
  8491: Drink...thissszzz...?${prompt}
  8492: |-
    Nothing <yawn!> happened...!?
    <Nod...nod...doze...>${prompt}
  8493: |-
    What? Oh, hell!
    Even after having drunk ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} well,
    Paku-Nakku still hasn't woken from the Sleep spell?${prompt}
  8494: |-
    There's something fishy I smell...
    I'm sure I negated the Sleep spell
    that was cast on that Paku-Nakku rebel!${prompt}
  8495: |-
    Let me look, by hook or by crook...
    I made him write his impressions of a book
    as punishment for the acts he took...${prompt}
  8496: |-
    That's it, I bray!
    To wake him up right away,
    to Paku-Nakku you must say:${prompt}
  8497: |-
    “Wake up, fool! Rise now, I bid it!
    The automaton butler's the one who did it!”${prompt}
  8498: You got that?${prompt}
  8499: |-
    To wake him up right away,
    to Paku-Nakku you must say...${prompt}

    “Wake up, fool! Rise now, I bid it!
    The automaton butler's the one who did it!”
    You got that?${prompt}
  8501: |-
    Did Paku-Nakku yell at you?
    To be expected, that is true.
    Fear not, he'll soon get over it, too.${prompt}
  8502: |-
    I never thought he'd go so reading beserk
    that it would affect his other classwork.
    Glad that's over, yes, my lord!
    By the way, here's a reward...${prompt}
  8503: |-
    So Paku-Nakku went angry at you...
    I suppose it's only natural to.
    Don't worry, he'll soon get over it too.${prompt}
  8504: '...Huh...?${prompt}'
  8505: |-
    The murderer was...?
    ${selection-lines}
    You! You did it!
    Me. Yes, I did it!
    The automaton butler did it!${prompt}
  8506: Noooooo!!!${prompt}
  8507: |-
    Ohhh maaan!
    I can't believe you gave away the ending! I was only halfway through reading “Murder on the Jeuno Express,” too!${prompt}
  8508: |-
    I really hate you!
    I'll never forgive you for that!
    Go away!${prompt}

    I hate you sooo much, dude!
    I'll never forgive you!
    Go away!${prompt}
  8513: |-
    What's all the noise about?
    You're disturbing the class.${prompt}
  8514: If you and Paku-Nakku don't shut up, I'll cast Silence on the both of you!${prompt}
  8515: Looks like Paku-Nakku finally woke up. What spell did you use on him?${prompt}
  8516: |-
    Anyway, thank you, I guess.
    Even if he is such a pain, I still want us all to graduate together.${prompt}
  8517: What have you got to do with me?${prompt}
  8518: |-
    You're so mean!
    Giving away the ending of a book to someone who's still reading it is just bad manners.${prompt}
  8519: I'm glad I finished that book before Paku-Nakku did. Otherwise you would have spoiled it for me as well.${prompt}
  8520: Ooowww......${prompt}
  8521: I hadn't read that book yet! <sniff>${prompt}
  8522: What, so you didn't know? Paku-Nakku was tirrred lately because he was hooked on the Agatha Crystalie mysterrry serrries.${prompt}
  8523: |-
    They are so cool!
    I just love Detective Poiroto-Boiroto and Miss Marpelpel... Unforrrtunately, the librarrry doesn't have the last book in the series yet...${prompt}

  8537: I guess you could say he was unlucky, or in the wrong place at the wrong time, or he was just plain asking for it... Oops... Maybe that last one's taking it a bit too far.${prompt}

  8588: |-
    Let me see...
    Have I explained Mog Houses to you before? If not, please allow me to.♪${prompt}

    Listen to Mog House explanation?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  8590: A Mog House is a personal apartment that we've provided for your convenience.${prompt}
  8591: Within your Mog House, you can carry out such activities as storing items, changing jobs, and healing HP and MP.${prompt}
  8592: As you are a citizen of Windurst, there's already a Mog House prepared for you. You'll find it up the stairs behind me.${prompt}
  8593: You are completely free to use the room as you see fit. Why, you can even arrange it to suit your own bad tastes.♪${prompt}
  8594: This is the entrance to Windurst's residential area, where a Mog House has been prepared for your use.${prompt}

  8604: This is the entrance to Windurst's residential area, where there are Mog Houses and Rent-a-Rooms available for people's use.${prompt}
  8605: Let me see... You're not a citizen of Windurst, are you? That means you can only lease a Rent-a-Room.${prompt}
  8606: When you lease a Rent-a-Room here, you can use that room as you would use your personal Mog House back in your home country. Isn't it just “kupo” convenient?♪${prompt}

  8610: Oh... Seeing you standing there gazing into the distance, I thought you were looking at something interesting. Seems as though you were just taking in the atmosphere of peaceful old Windurst.${prompt}
  8611: But I couldn't say that these are the most peaceful times Windurst has seen...${prompt}
  8612: If the Great Tree were to wither up and die, this whole country would pass away with it. Sadly, that end could be nigh...${prompt}
  8613: |-
    Ajido-Marujido!!!
    Are you bothering another poor adventurer?${prompt}
  8614: |-
    Excuse my big brother, friend.
    I am sure you were in the middle of something important before he rudely interrupted you.${prompt}
  8615: You've got it all wrong again, Apururu. This poor adventurer was lost, so I kindly offered to help. Isn't that rightaru?${prompt}
  8616: |-
    Is that so?
    Excuse me for asking, but...you wouldn't happen to be new to Windurst, would you?${prompt}

    Is there anything you need to do in particular? If so, don't be afraid to ask sweet Apururu!${prompt}
  8620: |-
    Oh, really?
    Are you trying to trick us city folk into thinking you're not some yokel or country bumpkin?${prompt}
  8621: Oh, don't get the wrong impression. We just haven't seen you around these parts before...${prompt}
  8622: |-
    So, hey, erm...
    Where are you heading?
    Do you want to chat a little?${prompt}
  8623: |-
    Find out about...?
    ${selection-lines}
    Going outside to battle.
    Where to shop.
    Gathering information.
    Where am I and who are you?${prompt}
  8624: |-
    Goodness-woodness!
    You've just arrived, and the first thing you want to do is run off to fightaru?${prompt}
  8625: Heh, brawn over brain, huh? As I always say, a life lived short is a life lived well!${prompt}
  8626: |-
    Ajido-Marujido!!!
    Bite your tongue!${prompt}
  8627: Why? It's true, isn'taru it?${prompt}
  8628: |-
    I'm ignoring my brother...
    The quickest way for you to die a horrible, unnecessary death is to go back along that road behind us.${prompt}
  8629: That will lead you to a stone gatehouse. On the other side of the town gates is Sarutabaruta. It's dangerous out there, so be careful.${prompt}
  8630: Say, you know how to “check” a monster and see how strong it is before you attack it, rightaru?${prompt}
  8631: Target your opponent and choose “Check” from the action menu. This will tell you the creature's strength relative to your current level.${prompt}
  8632: Don't attack opponents who you can't beataru. If you get into trouble, you can always select “Call for Help” to ask for assistance from the people around you...${prompt}
  8633: '...But whether or not there are fellow adventurers nearby who want to lend you a hand is another mattaru.${prompt}'
  8634: If no one comes to your help, well, that's just your bad luck, I suppose.${prompt}
  8635: Yes, my brother is correct for once...even though his manners could use some work.${prompt}
  8636: '......${prompt}'
  8637: Oh, and if you gather too many items to hold, head on down to Windurst's residential area.${prompt}
  8638: Each and every Windurstian citizen has their own personal residence, or Mog House, set aside for them. You can store your items in your room's Mog Safe.${prompt}
  8639: The residential area of Windurst is to the east of here. Head over the bridge into the neighboring Windurst Walls district and go to the right.${prompt}
  8640: I'm sure these pearls of wisdom will help you as you set out on your new adventures. Don't forgetaru them, now!${prompt}
  8641: Enough already! So much information at once is bound to confuse even the smartest Tarutaru. Besides, I don't have the time to be offering newbie-woobies free tours of our town.${prompt}
  8642: Wait a second, brother-wother!${prompt}
  8643: |-
    Sorry, but I have to go, too.
    If you need to know more, just ask our friend, Jack of Hearts. He's on patrol in the vicinity of the Huntman's Court.${prompt}
  8644: Here. If you give him this, I'm sure he'll reward you. To pass him the item, target him and select “Trade” from the main menu.${prompt}
  8645: |-
    I hope we meet again soon.
    Good luck, adventurer!${prompt}
  8646: |-
    Now you're talking my language!
    Shopping is my specialty.${prompt}
  8647: 'There are three shops in the Windurst Waters area: a general goods store, a magic dealer, and a milliner.${prompt}'
  8648: Firstly-wirstly, the general goods store, Ensasa's Catalyst Shop, is a fine place for your basic shopping needs.${prompt}
  8649: Not too pricey, and with good service. I recommend it for items such as potions and ether, but they have quite a selection of other items, too.${prompt}
  8650: Secondly-wecondly, there's the Federal Magic Reserve, and thirdly-wirdly, Baren-Moren the Hatter. These are both to the south of here, across the bridge.${prompt}
  8651: Baren-Moren the Hatter, as his name implies, deals in all kinds of headwear.${prompt}
  8652: Hee-hee. We Tarutaru take great pride in our headwear. A hat speaks volumes about the kind of Tarutaru you are.${prompt}
  8653: The hatter, Baren-Moren, is always looking for help in publicizing his wares. Many a new adventurer has earned pocket money there.${prompt}
  8654: The Federal Magic Reserve next door to Baren-Moren's is one of two magic shops in Windurst. It deals in higher-level magic.${prompt}
  8655: But you're just a beginner, so I don't think you'll be needing their services rightaru away. Then again, it pays to know these things for the future.${prompt}
  8656: If you're looking for beginner's magic or slightly stronger weapons and equipmentaru, you can always head to the port area, you know?${prompt}
  8657: To get to Port Windurst, head though the tunnel south of Baren-Moren's and the Federal Magic Reserve.${prompt}
  8658: The port area has a weapon shop, an armorer, and a magic shop, all in a row of quaint little boats docked on the wharves. I would even recommend it just for the scenery.${prompt}
  8659: But as we shopping specialists know, you need plenty of money...cold, hard gil...to buy what you wantaru.${prompt}
  8660: You can gain gil by selling raw materials and other items gained from defeating the monsters outside of town.${prompt}
  8661: Well, that's about all the advice I have for the novice adventurer.${prompt}
  8662: Hee-hee. Shopping is great fun, but be careful not to waste money on things you don't really need.${prompt}
  8663: If you need to know more, just ask our friend, Jack of Hearts. He's on patrol near the Huntsman's Court.${prompt}
  8664: Here. If you give Jacky-wacky this, I'm sure he'll reward you somehow. To pass him the item, target him and select “Trade” from the main menu.${prompt}
  8665: |-
    I hope we meet again soon.
    Good luck, my new adventurer friend!${prompt}
  8666: '...Phew! Impossible to get a word in edgewise, isn''t it? She may be my little sister, but I don''t understand her at all.${prompt}'
  8667: |-
    Well, I'd best be off, too.
    See you around, I suppose.
    Ta-taru!${prompt}
  8668: |-
    Duh! That's easy-weasy.
    Just walk around the whole town and talk to anybody and everybody.${prompt}
  8669: |-
    Oh, Ajido-Marujido!!!
    Bite your tongue!${prompt}
  8670: |-
    Let me see...
    I can tell you all the helpful information I know. Anything in particular you're interested in?${prompt}
  8671: |-
    Ask about...?
    ${selection-lines}
    Helping people.
    Monster patrol.
    Easy money.
    Looking for work.${prompt}
  8672: If you're volunteering to help, then please come to my ministry. It's called the Manustery, and is located in Windurst Woods. That's the district southeast of here.${prompt}
  8673: My members and I will tell you the details when you turn up. We'd be most appreciative of an extra hand.${prompt}
  8674: Humph. Watch out if you're going to deal with her. She loves to boss people around. Especially new arrivals like yourself.${prompt}
  8675: |-
    How dare you, Ajido-Marujido!
    Why don't you shut your mouth!${prompt}
  8676: Anyway, if you get stuck or don't know what to do, try asking other adventurers for advice.${prompt}
  8677: Only my brother is such a nasty, lying fiend. The rest of the people should be comparatively nicer.${prompt}
  8678: |-
    What did you call me!?
    That's rich, coming from fuddy-duddy, hoity-toity, you! Don't forget who's been looking after you all these years!${prompt}
  8679: |-
    Well, I never!
    I don't have the time for this nonsense. I'm off!${prompt}
  8680: "He～y! \nWait up, Ajido-Marujido!${prompt}"
  8681: Sorry, but I have to go, too. If you need to know more, ask our friend Jack of Hearts who is on patrol near the Huntsman's Court.${prompt}
  8682: Here. If you give Jacky-wacky this, I'm sure he'll reward you somehow. To pass him the item, target him and select “Trade” from the main menu.${prompt}
  8683: Bye-bye, and good luck, my new adventurer friend! Please drop by my Manustery when you're in Windurst Woods.${prompt}
  8684: |-
    Tsk. Adventurers these days...
    You shouldn't go around saying that when it's your first time in a big city. You're sure to run into trouble.${prompt}
  8685: Don't be too hard on novice adventurers. I think it's only rational to first improve one's economic standing before setting out on a new adventuring enterprise.${prompt}
  8686: In fact, I think I know justaru the right person to help you out...${prompt}
  8687: Oh, really? Who would ever tell you that they need help...?${prompt}
  8688: The hatter! Lately he's been calling out to my students, telling them that he'll give them some pocket money if they help him show off his wares.${prompt}
  8689: I'd say that the shape of your head isn't too displeasing, so you might be able to earn some money...${prompt}
  8690: Well, if you count that type of job as easy then, yes, it could be considered easy money, but...${prompt}
  8691: '...See, then it''s up to how well our friend performs. The more effort one puts in, the more one will earn!${prompt}'
  8692: I guess so. Well, good luck with it! I hope to see you again soon.${prompt}
  8693: If you need to know more, ask our friend, Jack of Hearts. He's on patrol near the Huntsman's Court.${prompt}
  8694: Here. If you give Jacky-wacky this, I'm sure he'll reward you somehow. To pass him the item, target him and select “Trade” from the main menu.${prompt}
  8695: The dhalmel farmer up near the Manustery seems to be having a pest problem. She's been asking for help in reducing the number of Crawlers in these parts.${prompt}
  8696: Speak to Illu Bohjaa. She's a Mithra who looks after the dhalmels at the dhalmel farm in Windurst Woods.${prompt}
  8697: Windurst Woods is the southeastern district of Windurst. Follow that little road eastwards, through Windurst Walls, on to the Woods district.${prompt}
  8698: It's quite a distance from Windurst Waters, but those dhalmels have such long necks, you should be able to spot them from a malm away.${prompt}
  8699: I hate that place. Windurst Woods is all so higgledy-piggledy, I get lost every time I try to walk through it.${prompt}
  8700: |-
    Really?
    If you just follow the path around, you'll find the dhalmel farm and Manustery relatively easily.${prompt}
  8701: |-
    But I don't go to those places.
    I usually go to...
    ......
    ............${prompt}
  8702: Oh, no! I totally forgotaru! I should be preparing for my experiment. Sorry. I've got to run!${prompt}
  8703: |-
    Oh brother-wother!
    What evil scheme are you up to now?
    Hold on a second!${prompt}
  8704: If you need to know more, ask our friend, Jack of Hearts. He's on patrol near the Huntsman's Court.${prompt}
  8705: Here. If you give Jacky-wacky this, I'm sure he'll reward you somehow. To pass him the item, target him and select “Trade” from the main menu.${prompt}
  8706: |-
    Good luck!
    I hope we meet again, soon.
    Ta-taru!${prompt}
  8707: |-
    That's easy.
    If you're looking for work, then head on over to one of the gatehouses.${prompt}
  8708: Follow that road behind you and it'll lead you to a big stone building. That's the north gatehouse.${prompt}
  8709: Gatehouses are special places that hand out missions on behalf of the Federation of Windurst.${prompt}
  8710: When you successfully complete missions obtained from the gatehouses, the town guards will increase your rank points.${prompt}
  8711: Collect enough rank points and your rank, or position within this country, will rise.${prompt}
  8712: Oh, and you're currently rank one, by the way.${prompt}
  8713: In other words, you're the lowest of the low, the weakest of the weak...${prompt}
  8714: '...Pay no attention to my brother.${prompt}'
  8715: You can only accept one mission at a time, but if you do each one properly, your rank is sure to go up in no time at all.${prompt}
  8716: Yeah, and then you'll be second-lowest of the low, the second most weakest of the weak...${prompt}
  8717: Oh, shut up already!${prompt}
  8718: Missions are done for the love of your country, so don't expect to make much money out of them. But give them your best shot! Not all rewards can be measured in gil.${prompt}
  8719: As you increase in rank, you can gain better things than gil can buy.${prompt}
  8720: Yeah, if your rank goes up enough, you might even be able to talk to us on equal footing.${prompt}
  8721: If you need to know anything else, ask our friend, Jack of Hearts. He's on patrol near the Huntsman's Court.${prompt}
  8722: Here. If you give old Jack this, I'm sure he'll reward you. To pass him it, target him and select “Trade” from the main menu.${prompt}
  8723: That's all the help I can give you for now. Well, see you around, newbie.${prompt}
  8724: Ah! Wait up, Ajido-Marujido.${prompt}
  8725: My brother always does things his own way, regardless of others.${prompt}
  8726: |-
    Good luck, adventurer!
    Hope to see you around someday.
    Bye-bye!${prompt}
  8727: |-
    This is Tarutaru.
    We are Windurst.
    You are our new slave...${prompt}
  8728: |-
    Oh, Ajido-Marujido!!!
    Bite your tongue!${prompt}
  8729: This place is called Windurst Waters. It is the oldest of the four districts of Windurst, and has been the center of Tarutaru life for ages.${prompt}
  8730: In Windurst, there are five educational and governmental ministries. The ministers themselves support the Star Sibyl, who rules over Windurst.${prompt}
  8731: Three of the ministries are here in Windurst Waters. Many Tarutaru are involved in studying a variety of subjects at these institutions.${prompt}
  8732: These three ministries are known as the Optistery, Rhinostery, and Aurastery. Respectively, they administrate a library, biological laboratory, and magic school.${prompt}
  8733: You'll also find several Tarutaru-run shops in this area.${prompt}
  8734: There's a hostelry, a general goods store, a milliner...oh, and the Culinarians' Guild, and the tavern... It will take you more than a day to see all the sights.${prompt}
  8735: Ah, and one shouldn't forget the residential area. Follow the little road that leads to Windurst Walls and turn right to find the entrance.${prompt}
  8736: In Windurst's residential area, there is a Mog House for you to store items and rest up in. Talk to the guards at the entranceway for the details.${prompt}
  8737: |-
    Ummm...
    What else were you asking aboutaru...?${prompt}
  8738: "Huh? \nOh yeah, just who in Vana'diel are we...!?${prompt}"
  8739: |-
    Hee-hee.
    Well, if you haven't figured it out already, I'm Apururu. Nice to meetaru you.♪${prompt}
  8740: |-
    Oh, yeah, and I'm Ajido-Marujido.
    It'll pay to remember me.${prompt}
  8741: Well, I guess you still have plenty of questions to ask, but we have to get going now.${prompt}
  8742: I suggest you ask your fellow adventurers for help. Vana'diel is a huge place, so you'll need to make as many friends as you can.${prompt}
  8743: |-
    Hah! Friends...
    I had better warn you...don't go around telling people you're my friend, rightaru?${prompt}
  8744: |-
    Ah, Ajido-Marujido!
    Wait up a moment!${prompt}
  8745: Oh, before I go, here, take this. Give it to our friend, Jack of Hearts, who is on patrol near the Huntsman's Court.${prompt}
  8746: Jacky-wacky is a good little Cardian who will tell you anything else you need to know. To pass him the coupon, target him and select “Trade” from the main menu.${prompt}
  8747: |-
    I hope to see you around some time. Good luck, my shiny-whiny adventurer friend.
    Ta-taru!♪${prompt}
  8748: |-
    What's that, a-tat-tat?
    Principal Koru-Moru is secretly searching for something special?${prompt}
  8749: A burnite shell...? Well, oh well...! Say, if it's shells you're seeking, your should speak to a son of the sea.${prompt}
  8750: "A book on Alchemy, eh?\nI'd love to take a look at one myself, I say. \nBut they were all banned years ago.\n'Twas said that they were a bad influence on children, you know?${prompt}"
  8751: |-
    I'm not certain whether they really were or not.
    All I do know is--if I haven't forgot--
    that getting your hands on one now
    will be close to impossible, I avow!${prompt}
  8752: Principal Koru-Moru is searching for a scholar knowledgeable in the art of Alchemy, eh? Still the dilly-dallier, I see...${prompt}
  8753: I wonder if he's seriously considering studying something so sinister as Alchemy? If so, he's not setting a good example for his students, is he, eh?${prompt}
  8754: |-
    Alchemical Alchemy?
    Now that you mention it, ever so long ago, a student wrote a graduation thesis on such a dubiously dubious topic...${prompt}
  8755: If I rememberingly remember, the principal at the time orderly ordered that student to stay back another year.${prompt}
  8756: What? You wantingly want to read that student's graduation thesis?${prompt}
  8757: It shouldn't be a problematic problem... Ask Katzun-Nattzun at the Acolyte Hostel to help find it for you.${prompt}
  8758: The hostel is the humongously huge building to the north of here.${prompt}
  8759: Graduation theses are tests to indicatingly indicate whether the students are able to graduate from the School of Magic.${prompt}
  8760: Katzun-Nattzun should knowingly know where that thesis is. You'll find him in the Acolyte Hostel, a humongously huge building to the north of here.${prompt}
  8761: ${prompt}
  8762: ${prompt}
  8763: What a fine sailor's cap... Such a shame it's so terribly torn...${prompt}
  8764: And these are made out of leather, too... It would be a damn sight quicker to make a new one.${prompt}
  8765: |-
    To-ho-ho...
    Might as well try full-scale surgery to see if we can resurrect the poor blighter.${prompt}
  8766: 'Listen up. I''ll need four ${item-plural: 1[2]} to save this worn and torn sailor...and a little bit of luck as well.${prompt}'

    Ta～da～♪ The operation was a success!
    To tell you the truth, I had been working on it using some of the leather I had lying around here. To-ho-ho.${prompt}
  8771: Oh, and here, I also made a little something for you, too...${prompt}
  8772: |-
    To-ho-ho!
    I just made it using the scraps of leather I had left over, but it's quite a dandy little design, isn't it?${prompt}
  8773: |-
    To-ho-ho!
    Not that it would happen, but if you ever lost your ${item-singular: 0[2]} again, just bring me four ${item-plural: 1[2]}, and I'll make you a new one.${prompt}
  8774: '${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 1[2]} to disguise yourself with, dearie? Oh...like Detective Poiroto-Boiroto in those Agatha Crystalie mystery series?${prompt}'
  8775: Oh, my daughter put you up to this? Well then, I guess it can't be helped...${prompt}
  8776: If you can collect four lumps of the fluffy cotton wool that the monsters in Tahrongi Canyon drop, I'll try and make you one.${prompt}
  8777: |-
    This should be enough.
    Hair nose, oops, I mean...
    Here goes...${prompt}
  8778: In the books, Detective Poiroto-Boiroto could change his appearance in a blink of the eye. That's why he's also known as the “Mastaru of Disguise”!${prompt}
  8779: Isn't he the mostest!?${prompt}
  8780: A while ago, I borrowed a chocobo so I could go on a fishing trip. But zee silly chocobo went and caught a cold.${prompt}
  8781: To make up for eet, I took some of my special stew to zee stables so zee chocobo could drink eet... Oh, so you want moi to make some of zat stew for you?${prompt}
  8782: 'I think it eez possible, but zee special stew I made that time had ${item-plural: 1[2]} in eet. You''ll have to bring moi three of zose little champignons...${prompt}'
  8783: Without zose special mushrooms, eet will just be a plain old stew.${prompt}
  8784: 'Zee ${item-plural: 1[2]} can be found in Jugner Forest, I believe.${prompt}'
  8785: Zey grow on zee bodies of zee toadstool monsters that lurk zere. Zey look grotesque and smell awful, but zee taste ees just exquisite!${prompt}
  8786: 'I need about three ${item-plural: 1[2]} in order to make zat special stew for you.${prompt}'
  8787: In order to get zose mushrooms, I recommend you try Jugner Forest. You should be able to collect zem by defeating zose toadstool monsters zat lurk zere.${prompt}
  8788: |-
    Zat's it!
    Once you've tried a dish with zese in zem, you'll keep coming back for more.${prompt}
  8789: |-
    One moment pleeze.
    I'll add a leettle of zis and a leettle of zis and...${prompt}
  8790: |-
    Voilà!
    Zis should get zat chocobo back on his feet again!${prompt}
  8791: Make sure you bring eet to heem while eet's still warm.${prompt}
  8792: Zat should get our chocobo friend back on his feet again!${prompt}
  8793: Make sure you serve it to heem while eet's still warm.${prompt}
  8794: I'm sure you've heard by now that there are five ministries in Windurst, haven'taru?${prompt}
  8795: This building houses one of those ministries, the Optistery, which runs a Library of Magic. For ages, they have been in chargey-wargey of the preservation of Windurst's books and scrolls.${prompt}
  8796: |-
    Welcome to the magical city of Windurst! Have you checked out the whole town yetaru?
    What's that...? You're having trouble talking with us Tarutaru?${prompt}
  8797: Well, we may be small and speak a little funny-wunny, but we're the best when it comes to using magic! If you have time, you should stop by the School of Magic and see how we learny-wearny!${prompt}
  8798: The research of magic is malms ahead in Windurst compared to the other countries. That's because the land in these parts was originally overflowing with magical power-wower.${prompt}
  8799: In Sarutabaruta, the land that surrounds Windurst, you'll find the Horutoto Ruins. They're incredibly ancient remnants from a sorcerous society!${prompt}
  8800: Don'taru you think the world's become all so rowdy-dowdy lately? The Manustery making Cardians like there's no tomorrow... The Orastery has gone and allowed the sale of high-level magic...${prompt}
  8801: A guy's got to think of an escape plan in case the whole place gets pulled into a war or something.${prompt}
  8802: Ahaha... You're such a worrywart. There won't be another war!${prompt}
  8803: So long as the Star Sibyl blesses us with her presence, the peace of Windurst is a given.${prompt}
  8804: I've come here to return the book I borrowed-worrowed from the Optistery's library. I'd really like to have kept it out a little longer, but...${prompt}
  8805: See, you have to return it back by the due date. If you don't, the magic placed on the books can fadey-wadey, and all the letters in the book will vanish in an instant!${prompt}
  8806: Do you know of them beastymens? Them be some smaaart monster-wonsters! They's attack peoples and steal peoples's stuff and all sorts of other nasty-wasty things.${prompt}
  8807: But they say them Yagudo aren't baaad beastymens. Them not like them other beastymens, they says. But is it true-wrue...? I wonders!${prompt}
  8808: When my daddy-waddy still had his health, he fought them Yagudo. He says all four countries united their powers to defeat the king of the beastymens at a castle waay up northy-worthy. I wish I lived back then.${prompt}
  8809: Ew! An indescribable smell occasionally comes wafting across from that building over yonder-wonder.${prompt}
  8810: That's the Culinarians' Guild, isn't it? What in Vana'diel are they cooking-wooking in there?${prompt}
  8811: That's the Culi...Culin...Culnira...Cooks' Guild! We's all likes Ranpi-Monpi who works there. He lets us taste all sortsa great stuff!${prompt}
  8812: He sez I've an iron-clad tummy-wummy, so I comes in mighty useful!${prompt}
  8813: |-
    ♪Nanah-nananah!♪
    Before a new dish gets added to the menu at the westaurant over there, we's alweady tasted it! I bet you're jealous, 'coz we're sooo wucky!${prompt}
  8814: Let kids be kids is what I say. Even if they're mischievous and hate to study, it's fine, so long as they are sound and well.${prompt}
  8815: Though it wouldn't hurt for them to master a few magical techniques, just in case the Yagudo Theomilitary decides to bear their beaks like they did twenty years ago...${prompt}
  8816: My mommy-wommy works in that shoppy-woppy there! When you comes back from your twavels outside, you just gotta stop by there!${prompt}
  8817: Want to learn how to use a little magic? You should stop by the School of Magic, which is run by the Aurastery. It's across the bridge here and up to your left.${prompt}
  8818: Oh... It's probably quicker to ask the students than the teachers. The educatees there are more eager scholars than the educators.${prompt}
  8819: Have you seen the Great Star Tree, the symbol of Windurst's peace? In the old days, we celebrated a Festival of the Stars where the Star Sibyl made the tree suddenly bloom with nuts.${prompt}
  8820: In the good old days, it was the custom to hold a Festival of the Stars as a welcoming after the Star Reading ceremony.${prompt}
  8821: But that was in the years before the war... After an ill-omened fortune was told in the Star Reading ceremony, we stopped conducting the Festival of the Stars.${prompt}
  8822: Across the bridge to the south of here is Baren-Moren's hat shop, and the Rhinostery with its biological laboratory.${prompt}
  8823: Further to the south is Windurst's port area. Ah, how I'd love to have a new hat made! I could wear it as I set off on a trip across the open skies...${prompt}
  8824: Among the guards of Windurst are the automatons who speaky-weaky in the words of the stars.${prompt}
  8825: They are the Cardians, magical puppet-like dolly-wollys that are made at the Manustery.${prompt}
  8826: Once in several hundred years, a great wizard is born out of the Tarutaru in Windurst. This wizard is so powerful, he is called the “Mastermind of the Millenium.”${prompt}
  8827: Decades ago, a child formidable enough to carry that title graduated at the top of his class from the School of Magic. I'm sure you'll hear his name mentioned as the hero who saved Windurst.${prompt}
  8828: The Horutoto Ruins in Sarutabaruta are also called the magic towers, and are said to have the power to control the monsters of Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  8829: But they were damaged terribly-werribly during the war. Now, most of the magical gizmos in there don't work anymore.${prompt}
  8830: |-
    Ahhh...
    If only those magic towers could be restored, the Sarutabaruta region could have peace once more.${prompt}
  8831: With all the powers that the elite scholars of Windurst have, you'd think we could repair the Horutoto Ruins right away. The engineering skills of the ancients must be more complicated than we think. It's most disappointing-wointing.${prompt}
  8832: But speaking of scholars, I wonder what happened to all the combat scholars that made up a large portion of the Federation's ranks during the Crystal War. It was rumored that there were more than a handful of suspicious characters among them.${prompt}
  8833: Please, oh pleee～eeease. Can'taru you buy me just one more hat?${prompt}
  8834: I need one for daytime and one for nighttime. That means I need eight more hats!${prompt}
  8835: Enough is enough, already-weddy! Eight hats are sufficientaru for all the days of the week.${prompt}
  8836: In the Tarutaru estates area here, the biggest and grandest house is inhabited by a super-rich Tarutaru.${prompt}
  8837: But he's the perfect picture-wicture of a miser. When you just walk by his house, he judgmentally glares down at you as if you are a pauper-wauper or something. I can't stand it!${prompt}
  8838: This certainly-wertainly is the road to the School of Magic. But what business do you have there? Aren't you a little old to be applying for school?${prompt}
  8839: My daughter's in the School of Magic. She spends her days working hard at her studies there.${prompt}
  8840: Does she realize her daddy-waddy is here on this hill every day worrying about her? Is she eating her lunchy-wunchy properly? Is she being teased by the class bully-wully?${prompt}
  8841: "Daughter dearest! \nYour Daddy-waddy's here, cheering you on! You go girl! Woo-hoo!${prompt}"
  8842: In the School of Magic, there is an advanced class for the smarty-warties and a beginners class for the mediocre students.${prompt}
  8843: What's that!? You think you can enter the advanced class, huh? Well, the last year had a Mithra pass the grade, so maybe even you could give it a try...?${prompt}
  8844: Grrr... I don't have enough gil to buy anything worrrthwhile. Guess I've got to head back out to Sarrrutabarrruta and hunt some more rarrrabs.${prompt}
  8845: Doesn't seem like therrre's any good offerrrs for half-baked adventurrrerrrs like you and me. Betterrr off sticking to rabbiting forrr the time being.${prompt}
  8846: |-
    What was it called again?
    You know, the grrreat, whopping whatchamacallit monsterrr that stopped appearrring, allowing old Windurst to returrrn to its peaceful state?${prompt}
  8847: Back in the old days, when therrre was a full moon, the Tarutaru would lock and barrr theirrr doorrrs, too afrrraid to even peek outside.${prompt}
  8848: 'Aren''t you an adventurer from ${choice: 0}[San d''Oria/Bastok]? Instead of staying in a hostelry, wouldn''t it be cheaper for you to stay in a Rrrent-a-Rrroom in Windurst''s rrresidential area?${prompt}'
  8849: The rrresidential area is east of here. Cross the bridge there and turn rrright where the Cardian is on guard.${prompt}
  8850: |-
    Hey, aren't you a Windurstian?
    Instead of staying at a hostelry, why don't you use your Mog House in Windurst's rrresidential area? It's free, isn't it?${prompt}
  8851: The rrresidential area is east of here. Cross the bridge there and turn rrright where the Cardian is on guard.${prompt}
  8852: Therrre's a strrrange lady staying in the rrroom on the second floor of the hostelrrry. She's funny, even forrr a Hume!${prompt}
  8853: But she's loved by the Tarrrutarrru. I guess it's trrrue what they say about “chocobos of a featherrr flocking togetherrr.”${prompt}
  8854: |-
    Ahh!?
    Maybe, just maybe...she could be a prrrincess underrr some wicked spell?${prompt}
  8855: That building therrre is a hat shop, of all things. Don't you think it shows how carefrrree a rrrace those Tarutaru are to make such a whimsical business?${prompt}
  8856: Hats arrre totally useless! Give me a properrr armorrr helmet any day!${prompt}
  8857: When I look at these flowerrrs, I feel like having a drrrink. But then again, I feel like having a drrrink all of the time.${prompt}
  8858: If only I had some fluoro-flora juice. It's as bitterrr as uncooked gysahl greens, but the taste rrreminds me of home.${prompt}
  8859: The orrriginal fluoro-flora seeds are from the Mithra homeland, you see...${prompt}
  8860: Huh... So this is the biological laborrratory that is rrrun by the Rhinostery, eh? Doesn't seem so exciting, rrreally...${prompt}
  8861: I hearrrd that they carry out some weirrrd experiments herrre. Do you know anything about that?${prompt}
  8862: Those strange plants that glow in the dark? They say that they make them in the Rhinostery.${prompt}
  8863: How do you make plants that glow? Windurst is truly a land of wonders. Why, I heard rumors that during the Crystal War, the ministry spent a great deal of Federation funding on queer biotechnological experiments such as the development of sleep-inducing fruit and vegetables that would not spoil for years.${prompt}
  8864: The residents here are a timid people, yet they know very well the beauty of the night. I'm amazed that they can create such exquisite plants.${prompt}
  8865: |-
    Phew... I finally made it!
    So this is the city of Windurst...?${prompt}
  8866: I had a nasty experience when I was attacked by those awful Yagudo out there in Sarutabaruta. All that talk of the Tarutaru and Yagudo being on friendly terms is just a bunch of lies, eh?${prompt}
  8867: But the Windurstians seem to be saying it with a straight face...?${prompt}
  8868: |-
    Ahhh, I'm sooo full!
    I just ate ten servings! Hahaha... Are you impressed? Well, that there restaurant sells only Tarutaru-sized servings, and ten is quite an easy amount to stomach.${prompt}
  8869: However, the owner was telling me that during the Crystal War, there were times when a lack of rations forced the restaurant to close its doors. Can you believe it?${prompt}
  8870: In the war of twenty years ago, Windurst received a painful blow from the beastmen. Yet the constructions around here are rather new, leading one to assume these were built after the war.${prompt}
  8871: Well now, my son and I came to view the ruins here, so we should be heading on over to Windurst Walls. They are east of here, are they not?${prompt}
  8872: Why doesn't Windurst have high castle walls like San d'Oria? They should learn how to build proper towns from us San d'Orians!${prompt}
  8873: You're now in Windurst Waters. If you like, I'll use my incredible magic abilities to send you over to Windurst Woods, far to the east of here.${prompt}
  8874: |-
    Warp to Windurst Woods?
    ${selection-lines}

  8886: Today we have fresh seafood by the boatload. Why not try our fish for lunch or dinner?${prompt}
  8887: The cooking herrre is carrried overrr from the Culinarrrians' Guild, so that's why the taste is top class.${prompt}
  8888: People come from farrr and abrrroad just to taste ourrr dishes. Arrren't you imprrressed?${prompt}
  8889: I'm the house flutist. I do nightly performances at this restaurant.${prompt}

  8892: Please enjoy some soul-soothing music for a while.${prompt}
  8893: I'm in charrrge of the daytime perrrforrrmances. Durrring the nights, I also enjoy listening in on Jatan-Paratan's flute perrrforrrmances.${prompt}
  8894: By the way, I hope my daughterrr hasn't offended you. She's a little rrrowdy at times...${prompt}
  8895: Enjoy yourrr stay herrre.${prompt}
  8896: It took us twenty long years to restore our town, and just when we think we have it good, along come the rumors of war again...${prompt}
  8897: Don't tell me we need to sacrifice the lives of so many mages...not to mention the innocent lives of our wee children...?${prompt}
  8898: If it takes some tribute offerings to the Yagudo to avoid a full-blown war, then I'm happy to offer it to them.${prompt}
  8899: This may be a little rude of me, but have you, my fair customer, ever listened to one of my performances?${prompt}
  8900: I perform here during the nights. My job is to assist you in your enjoyment of our fine food and drinks with my dreamy-weamy melodies.${prompt}
  8901: Please stop by the next evening you are free, and enjoy the rhythm of the night.${prompt}
  8902: Have you, my fair customer, ever listened to one of my performances? If you don't mind giving your opinion, perhaps you could let me know your thoughts for my future reference.${prompt}
  8903: |-
    How did you like his performance?
    ${selection-lines}
    It was like music to my ears.
    Face the music! It wasn't so good.
    I have no recollection at all.${prompt}
  8904: So you think my playing still needs work?${prompt}
  8905: I appreciate your honest opinion. I shall strive to continuously improve my skills.${prompt}
  8906: Why, thank you so very much. I'll take that as encouragement to continuously improve my skills.${prompt}
  8907: Please stop by and listen again some time.${prompt}
  8908: As a simple musician that would be taken as biting criticism, but as a restaurant performer, it is the greatest of praises. Thank you very much.${prompt}
  8909: I strive to create music that complements your meal and doesn't distract from your conversation. Please stop by and enjoy the atmosphere again some time.${prompt}
  8910: My fair customer, what are your thoughts on our restaurant here?${prompt}
  8911: I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked that. It's not like I'm the owner of the place or anything like that...${prompt}
  8912: I just love the tastes and atmosphere of this restaurant. I shall never forget the bliss I encountered here in the middle of my long, hard travels.${prompt}
  8913: After discovering this place, I simply forced the proprietor into allowing me to have a position here. Alas...but then...${prompt}
  8914: |-
    ......
    I'm sorry.
    I don't know what came over me...
    Please forget it.${prompt}
  8915: |-
    ......
    I'm sorry, I don't know what came over me... Please forget what I said.${prompt}
  8916: Come to think of it, a little while back, a barrrd from Jeuno came herrre to stay forrr a spell.${prompt}
  8917: My motherrr said that everrr since that barrrd arrrrived, Jatan-Paratan has been acting all strrrange.${prompt}
  8918: That tenant was a Hume with the most amazing facial hair I've seen!${prompt}
  8919: I worrrry about Jatan-Paratan lately. He only performs quiet numbers now...${prompt}
  8920: Before, he used to play cheerful tunes that seemed to make us forrrget about the day's fatigue. I wonder what is troubling him?${prompt}
  8921: Naturally, I also am most worried about Jatan-Paratan.${prompt}
  8922: That bard who came from Jeuno the other day appears to be an old traveling companion of his. So I assume that when they got caught up on each other's tales, he suddenly got the urge to start wandering again...?${prompt}
  8923: Ah? What's this...? Where in Vana'diel did you get this...?${prompt}
  8924: Don't tell me you traveled all the way to Jeuno to meet Ruslan! Why would you do such a thing?${prompt}
  8925: |-
    What?
    Yung and Yuli Yaam were worried that I'm not myself of late...${prompt}
  8926: I am sincerely touched by the fact you all care so much about me...${prompt}
  8927: Allow me to share my heartfelt feelings with you...${prompt}
  8928: '''Twas a little while ago that Ruslan, an old acquaintance who practiced music with me, came to this very tavern and let me hear of his recent tales.${prompt}'
  8929: He praised my performance greatly, but had no interest in the food of this restaurant.${prompt}
  8930: Despite sojourning here for several weeks and eating the food here every night, he couldn't remember the slightest thing about the restaurant's cooking.${prompt}
  8931: '''Twas then that I realized that my flamboyant performance itself was detracting from the tastes and atmosphere of this tavern.${prompt}'
  8932: It was like I was repaying the tavern owner's kindness with evil...or biting the hand that feeds me--no, everyone...${prompt}
  8933: And so now I'm searching within myself for a more appropriate sound. Alas, I've been unable to find it yet.${prompt}
  8934: I apologize for the trouble I've caused...drawing you into my own personal problems...problems that shouldn't concern one as esteemed as yourself.${prompt}
  8935: But, yes indeed, this was once the goal I sought after. I shall gladly accept it from you. However, let me pay you back with this...${prompt}
  8936: That is also a little something I collected while I was first obsessed with music.${prompt}
  8937: I was going to throw it away, but I suppose if one were to sell it, it would fetch quite a sum. Please take it. I hope it assists you in your travels.${prompt}
  8938: I beg your pardon, but, if you don't mind...could we kindly keep this between you and me, and not bother Yung and Yuli Yaam with my problems?${prompt}
  8939: I don't want to worry them any further with my problems. It might affect Yuli's philosophy towards music...${prompt}
  8940: I just love Yuli Yaam's music.${prompt}
  8941: Perhaps it is selfish of me, but when I first came here midway through my journeys, I wished both this place and its music would stay the same.${prompt}
  8942: I don't know what is botherrring Jatan-Paratan, but I've decided to carrrry on as if nothing has changed.${prompt}
  8943: I hope that my warrrm-hearrrted music will prrrovide him with morrre comforrrt and encourrragement than worrrds can...${prompt}
  8944: I hope my harrrp can ease Jatan-Paratan's melancholy hearrrt, even a little.${prompt}
  8945: Motherrr is such a worrrrierrr! Jatan-Paratan seems his same old self again to me.${prompt}
  8946: But I must say that I did prrreferrr the cheerrrful little ditties Jatan-Paratan used to play beforrre. They werrre morrre my type of music.♪${prompt}

  9059: The perfect stone has to be just the right weight. Not too heavy and not too light. It might take us several tries to find the right one, but we'll just have to keep at it until we do.${prompt}
  9060: If you bear with me until we find just the right stone, then I'll give you a fitting little present.${prompt}

    The Cat Burglar must have smelt a rat...
    Nanaa Mihgo didn't want us to expose her hideaway, so she stole the story before it could go into circulation. Agh...someone really let the cat outta the bag!${prompt}
  9122: Aa～ah! This week's edition of the “Magic Paradise Weekly” is going to be canceled as well. It happens so often, though, that nobody's going to notice anyway...<Sigh>${prompt}

    Conquest points.
    The effects of controlling regions.
    Regions controlled by other nations.
    Regions under beastman control.${prompt}
  9261: All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt}
  9262: Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt}
  9263: Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt}
  9264: So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt}
  9265: |-
    Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.
    They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt}
  9266: Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt}
  9267: Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt}
  9268: |-
    So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.
    We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt}
  9269: |-
    You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.
    Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt}
  9270: |-
    Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.
    The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt}
  9271: |-
    You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  9272: |-
    We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  9273: |-
    You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.
    Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt}
  9274: Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt}
  9275: |-
    You also receive rank points for completing missions.
    Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt}
  9276: |-
    You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.
    Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}
  9277: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt}
  9278: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt}
  9279: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt}
  9280: Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt}
  9281: Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt}
  9282: Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt}
  9283: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt}
  9284: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt}
  9285: |-
    Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.
    If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt}
  9286: If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt}
  9287: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt}
  9288: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt}
  9289: There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt}

  9587: Phooey, Dewey! I'm sooo confused. This goes over...no, that goes...no, this needs to be...no...${prompt}
  9588: What? No... Here from Bastok, are we? Yes? How may I help? No...assist, yes, assist.${prompt}

  9590: It turned up the last time, or was it the first...no...the last time I cleaned out the old book vault. That text was filled with lots of important-looking blacksmithing techniques.${prompt}
  9591: One look, and I knew this book didn't belong here in Windurst, I mean...not here in this library...I mean.${prompt}
  9592: So, I decided to take it to Bastok and see if I could shed any light on the mystery surrounding the text...and that's when I was attacked by a band of rogues...Yagudo rogues, they were.${prompt}
  9593: If we ever want to see it again, we'll have to travel to Giddeus and get it back from that thief, Vaa Huja the Erudite, ourselves.${prompt}
  9594: Well, I didn't exactly mean “ourselves.” You're the adventurer, aren't you...yes?${prompt}
  9595: 'That thief, Vaa Huja the Erudite, is probably using ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} to line his birdcage as we speak!${prompt}'

  9598: Oh, yes, and when you take that back to Bastok, could you ask them if there are any other books they can donate? If they don't have any, a generous donation of gil would work just as well.${prompt}

  9616: |-
    I hear that he hates this kind of bother-wothersome procedure...
    Whatever it is, it must be importantaru.${prompt}
  9617: This is a mission from Minister Ajido-Marujido. Please hurry to the Orastery.${prompt}
  9618: You should really get to the Orastery while the minister is still in Windurst. He tends to disappear without so much as a ta-taru.${prompt}
  9619: |-
    How goes the adventuring life?
    Your new mission is from the Orastery, rightaru?${prompt}
  9620: Minister Ajido-Marujido is the most super spell-slinger in Windurst. Or maybe that would be Doctor Shantotto?${prompt}
  9621: I wonder who would win in a duel of dweomers? It would be a close match, don't you think?${prompt}
  9622: There's a well-known story from the time when Minister Ajido-Marujido was in magic school.${prompt}
  9623: The minister got stompily-womped in the monster-hunting exam on Buburimu Peninsula when he tried to beat the record held by Karaha-Baruha. He really-weally hates to lose.${prompt}

  9629: |-
    Have you heard?
    Minister Ajido-Marujido has finally incurred the wrath of the Star Sibyl and was thrown into the Dark Dungeon-wungeon!${prompt}
  9630: |-
    It's a frightening place.
    Lawbreakers sent to the Dark Dungeon are said to go loopy-woopy from fear.${prompt}

    ...But enough about that.
    The Star Sibyl has sent a summons for you to appear at Heavens Tower.${prompt}

  9634: Minister Ajido-Marujido's imprisonment has been kept a secret-wecret from the general public. If this news were to reach the ears of a foreign spy or a beastman, there are those who would take advantage of the situation to stage a coup.${prompt}
  9635: |-
    ...But enough of my idle-widle speculations.
    The Star Sibyl awaits your presence at Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  9636: The mages of the Orastery must all be in a flurry-scurry. The imprisonment of a minister is unprecedented.${prompt}
  9637: |-
    What can be done to soothe the fury-wury of the Star Sibyl?
    No matter how much I ponder-wonder, I justaru can't think of anything!${prompt}
  9638: The Star Sibyl awaits you at Heavens Tower. It appears to be a very gravy-wave matter.${prompt}
  9639: If you're thinking of running off to another country, now's the time to do it. I should tell you, though, the guards will definitaruly come after you. I'm sorry you gotaru mixed up in all this.${prompt}

  9643: And now you have another mission-wission from the Optistery. Something about giving a hand with the ministry's spring cleaning...${prompt}
  9644: Why would they ask a rank seven adventurer to help with something like that? They must want you to handle some spooky-wooky tomes or gruesome grimoires.${prompt}
  9645: Your mission from the Optistery is a request to help with the ministry's spring cleaning...${prompt}
  9646: Why would they ask a rank seven adventurer to help with something like that? They must want you to handle some troublesome tomes or gruesome grimoires.${prompt}
  9647: Did you think things would get easier as your rank got higher?${prompt}
  9648: Heh-heh-heh, you've got it all topsy-turvy. There aren'taru too many high-ranked adventurers, so you get to do all the really difficultaru missions!${prompt}
  9649: Minister Tosuka-Porika of the Optistery was never very buddy-wuddy with Minister Ajido-Marujido.${prompt}

    Aren'taru you the adventurer who completed my last mission?${prompt}
  9655: Heh-heh-heh... Actually, the mission I issued to the gatehouse was justaru a cover-up.${prompt}
  9656: Since the incidentaru with Ajido-Marujido, the Sibyl Guards have been paying too much attention to the mission statements...${prompt}
  9657: '...Rightaru, down to business. Do you remember the mission I issued last time?${prompt}'
  9658: The Book of the Gods... We had no idea of its location for all those years after the war. That was the tome you recovered for us from the dastard-wastardly Cat Burglar.${prompt}
  9659: Ajido-Marujido then swiped the book, and delivered it to the Star Sibyl himself.${prompt}
  9660: |-
    Then a few days ago...
    The Star Sibyl summoned me to Heavens Tower and handed the Book of the Gods over to me.${prompt}
  9661: I was ordered to never letaru that tome see the light of day again.${prompt}
  9662: |-
    ...Hrmmm...
    That's what the Star Sibyl ordered, so I mustaru obey!
    But I...that is something I just cannot do!${prompt}
  9663: The pages of the Book of the Gods are blank! I cannot turn my eyes from the truth. As the name of the Optistery suggestarus, we are the eyes of Windurst!${prompt}
  9664: If I ignore the truth before me, how can I call myself the Minister of the Optistery?${prompt}
  9665: |-
    Here is the deal.
    What I am aboutaru to tell you must be in the strictest-wictest of confidence. You mustn'taru leak a word of it to anyone.${prompt}
  9666: When I was still justaru a student, I heard about the Book of the Gods from the minister at the time...Minister Karaha-Baruha.${prompt}
  9667: The Book of the Gods refers to the “True History” written by the first Star Sibyl for the benefitaru of the Star Sibyls that would succeed her.${prompt}
  9668: The truth contained in this book can be extremely-wemely dangerous, and it has been passed down through generations of Ministers.${prompt}
  9669: Consequentaruly, the Book of the Gods is sealed by powerful spells. This seal can only be broken through the expenditure of huge amountarus of magic while employing the “Diza Star” that hangs from the neck of the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  9670: '...I don''taru know how he did it, but Minister Karaha-Baruha managed to obtain the Star Sibyl''s permission to open the Book of the Gods.${prompt}'
  9671: To breach the seal on the tome, the minister utilized the power of the Horutoto Ruins' magical towers...${prompt}
  9672: '...And from the Book of the Gods, he learned a certain truth. This truth was indeed a dangerous thing.${prompt}'
  9673: Karaha-Baruha carried outaru his research in a laboratory hidden within Toraimarai Canal...${prompt}
  9674: |-
    You mightaru call this laboratory the sixth ministry of Windurst.
    ...The Animastery...${prompt}
  9675: Adventurer, find that ministry. If you enter the Animastery, you may find something from Minister Karaha-Baruha's research.${prompt}
  9676: We mustaru discover the reason why the writings contained in this tome have vanished.${prompt}
  9677: |-
    Ah yes, I mustaru give you this.
    You should be able to enter the Animastery using this ring.
    It is the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}. Try your bestaru not to lose it.${prompt}
  9678: Go to Toraimarai Canal and find the Animastery. There you may find the remnantarus of Minister Karaha-Baruha's research.${prompt}
  9679: |-
    ...Hrmmm!
    Ah yes, don't go losing that ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}! I'm trusting you to take good care of it!${prompt}
  9680: |-
    How's the mission going?
    You know, the cleaning of the book vault?${prompt}
  9681: Up until now, we've been giving up our holidays to keep things clean and tidy around here. But it looks like Minister Tosuka-Porika has finally agreed to get an adventurer to help us.${prompt}
  9682: There can't be a soul in Windurst who doesn't know the name of former Optistery Minister Karaha-Baruha.${prompt}
  9683: |-
    He was a great genius who gave his life to save Windurst...
    The greatest Minister of the Optistery.${prompt}
  9684: This is just between you and me, but there's a rumor that the great genius Karaha-Baruha only became the Minister of the Optistery so he could read the Book of the Gods.${prompt}
  9685: It's definitaruly unusual that a mage of his caliber wouldn't become head of the Orastery instead.${prompt}
  9686: |-
    ...Phewaaah...?
    Huh? You found an old ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}?${prompt}
  9687: |-
    ...That looks like the ring that belonged to our previous minister, Karaha-Baruha.
    It was lost during the trouble-woubles of the Great War. But somebody was wearing it, rightaru?${prompt}
  9688: |-
    ...Huaaah...?
    We're in the middle of cleaning out the book vault, so no borrowing today. Terribly sorry.${prompt}
  9689: |-
    What's going on?
    The minister seems to be troubled.
    But the dimwit at the counter is half asleep as usual.${prompt}
  9690: Hey, I wonder if they have any books written by one of the line of great geniuses?${prompt}
  9691: I should ask the minister about it someday.${prompt}
  9692: |-
    Hrm!?
    Oh, you finally made it back.${prompt}
  9693: |-
    How did it go!?
    Did you find anything!?${prompt}
  9694: |-
    Wh-wh-wh-wh-what!!!
    The Star Sibyl was there!?${prompt}
  9695: |-
    Oh, my goodly Goddess...
    Charges could be brought against me...
    If they throw me in the Dark Dungeon, all is lostaru!${prompt}
  9696: |-
    Hrm, adventurer!
    My life is in your hands. Take this and keep it safe.${prompt}
  9697: I-i-if I am imprisoned in the Dark Dungeon, take it to the Star Sibyl and use it to secure my freedom.${prompt}
  9698: |-
    Hrmmm!
    This is not blackmail.
    ...This is negotiation! Yes, you will negotiate my freedom with the Star Sibyl!${prompt}
  9699: |-
    Don't breathey-weathe a word of this to anyone!
    Now quickly, get yourself away from here!${prompt}
  9700: I-i-if I am imprisoned in the Dark Dungeon, take it to the Star Sibyl and use it to secure my freedom.${prompt}
  9701: |-
    Hrmmm!
    This is not blackmail.
    ...This is negotiation! Yes, you will negotiate my freedom with the Star Sibyl!${prompt}
  9702: For some reason, the words “Book vault cleaning” have been written in hugey-wuge letters on our schedule board.${prompt}
  9703: |-
    There must be some mistake.
    You've already cleaned out our book vault, rightaru?${prompt}
  9704: |-
    The sixth ministry of Windurst?
    Of course, everyone's heard the rumors. But they're justaru rumors...${prompt}
  9705: |-
    What!? There really was a sixth ministry!?
    That's abolutely-wutely astonishing! Who was the minister, I wonder?${prompt}
  9706: Why is Minister Tosuka-Porika so crimsony-red in the face?${prompt}
  9707: |-
    Oh, I think I know.
    You messed up the book vault when you cleaned, didn't you?${prompt}
  9708: |-
    A mission has been issued by the Rhinostery.
    They must have been in a hurry-wurry, as there's not much written here.${prompt}
  9709: Please talk to Leepe-Hoppe on the second floor of the Rhinostery for the details.${prompt}
  9710: A little while ago, I happened to see Minister Rukususu of the Rhinostery go past.${prompt}
  9711: I wonder if her homecoming means she made some important-wortant discovery? I'd really like to know what this mission-wission is all about.${prompt}
  9712: Most people think that the Rhinostery justaru researches plants, but actually, their research encompasses all living things.${prompt}
  9713: |-
    Biology researchers wander all over Vana'diel.
    The mostaru capable adventurers of the Rhinostery always accompany these researchers on their treks into dangerous territory.${prompt}

  9724: Please go talk with him firstaru. If he doesn't know someone has accepted the mission, he won't be able think straight for worry.${prompt}
  9725: The truth of it is, Minister Rukususu made an importantaru discovery in Fei'Yin and brought back an item with her.${prompt}
  9726: I can'taru explain what that item was exactly, but it gave me the heeber-jeebers.${prompt}
  9727: When I meditated on it, I sensed something unusual.${prompt}
  9728: Do you know of Iru-Kuiru? He was a member of the Multinational Expedition that traveled to the Northlands thirty years ago, and was originally a biology researcher for the Rhinostery...${prompt}
  9729: '...I could feel his spirit. He seemed to be somewhere on the southern continent...${prompt}'
  9730: '...When I told this to Minister Rukususu, she immediately took off in a terrible scurry-hurry.${prompt}'
  9731: What is it between those two? It was definitely not the reaction I was expecting.${prompt}
  9732: The item that Minister Rukususu found appears to be suffused with Iru-Kuiru's memories of his visit to the Northlands.${prompt}
  9733: Hmm? How do I know that? Because I'm one of the besty-west researchers at the Rhinostery, that's why.${prompt}
  9734: |-
    Go to the southern continent right away,
    And rescue Rukususu from her path gone astray!${prompt}
  9735: |-
    Iru-Kuiru was cursed unto death!
    It's been thirty years since his last living breath!
    Our beloved minister could end up sharing his fate,
    So be on your way, before it's too late!${prompt}
  9736: '...Please...save...Minister...Rukususu...${prompt}'
  9737: '...<sob>...<sniff>...${prompt}'
  9738: When the chance to join the Multinational Expedition came to the Rhinostery, no one was particularly eager to sign up. The Northlands is a dreadful-wedful place.${prompt}
  9739: |-
    Only Iru-Kuiru had the courage to put his hand up and volunteer.
    I wish that I could be as brave as Iru-Kuiru.${prompt}

  9759: Your nextaru mission is one from the Aurastery. Please get the details from the instructors at the School of Magic.${prompt}
  9760: This mission from the Aurastery is totally tip-top secret. I can't imagine what it could be...${prompt}
  9761: '...Nope, drawing a completaru blank. The Aurastery is supposed to be the most peaceful of the five ministries, though, so how bad could it be?${prompt}'
  9762: The principal of the School of Magic is a very pleasant, although eccentric, character.${prompt}
  9763: When we were kids--just normal students at the school, the principal would come and join in our Tarutaru games.${prompt}
  9764: |-
    Have you met Professor Koru-Moru?
    He's the very, um, unique professor in Windurst Walls.${prompt}
  9765: He once retired as the principal of the School of Magic, but due to an incidentaru a couple of years ago, he was reinstated.${prompt}
  9766: PeoPLe★aRE frEE★tO ChOOse★wHEthER oR★nOt tHEy★aTTeNd tHE★SchoOL oF MaGIc.${prompt}

  9768: Sorry to keep you waiting. I guess you must be the gallant who got our mission at the gatehouse.${prompt}
  9769: Are you acquainted with the amazing academic who administers our School of Magic?${prompt}
  9770: |-
    Acquainted with the amazing academic?
    ${selection-lines}
    Absolutely!
    Actually, no.${prompt}
  9771: |-
    ${choice: 2}[Ah, so you've met/I'm sure you've met] Professor Koru-Moru.
    As you are assuredly aware, Professor Koru-Moru rarely roams from his residence in Windurst Walls... He barely bothers with the barest bones of his principal business...${prompt}
  9772: Four years ago, he took a rest from his responsible role. During that time, the person who took his tenure had the title of Sedal-Godjal.${prompt}
  9773: With his dynamic endurance and diligent deductions, Sedal-Godjal was a marvelous nominee for Minister of the Aurastery.${prompt}
  9774: However, for some reason, he eloped and left us in the lurch. We put Professor Koru-Moru back in the position of principal, and now you perceive our present predicament.${prompt}
  9775: For three long years our lecturers have lived with the lack of a leader and luckily allayed any alarming eventualities. But if we continue to conduct our school on this course, I am concerned it will conflict with the cultivation of our students.${prompt}
  9776: This is where you come in. I supplicate you to search the span of Vana'diel, and bring back Sedal-Godjal.${prompt}
  9777: 'Our elusive educator was equipped with ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}. This “Star Seeker” should come in handy.${prompt}'
  9778: Professor Koru-Moru called for the construction of this Star Seeker in case the location of the principal's ring became obfuscated. It can sniff out the power of the stars and the moon infused in the ring.${prompt}
  9779: When the professor was young and careless, he used it to search for the ring whenever he misplaced it.${prompt}
  9780: The Star Seeker will suddenly start speaking, so be sure not to let its spiel slip by you.${prompt}
  9781: Stand by. Power on!${prompt}
  9782: |-
    Ahahahahaha!
    Let's go, slacker! Start heading north!${prompt}
  9783: Use the magic doll you have been given to follow the magical emanations of the principal's ring and track down our wayward Mr. Sedal-Godjal.${prompt}
  9784: Don't forget the Star Seeker will suddenly start speaking, so be sure not to let its spiel slip by you.${prompt}
  9785: "I wonder to where our former principal Sedal-Godjal disappeared? \nIf he showed up in the morning, now wouldn't that be weird?${prompt}"
  9786: |-
    I wonder why he ran away?
    Couldn't he take the day-to-day?${prompt}
  9787: When our new principal disappearingly disappeared it didn't come as much of a shock, but without anyone to replacingly replace him, the Aurastery was in quite a fix.${prompt}
  9788: |-
    ...What's that? Me?
    Oh no, no, no, far too troublingly troublesome.${prompt}
  9789: The Manustery is currently mass-producing Cardians, but they used to manufacture magic dolls.${prompt}
  9790: Relatively few people can master the techniques required to make them. I wonder why Professor Koru-Moru never took a position at the Manustery!${prompt}
  9791: I'm having twouble-wouble with my study-wudies, so I came from the beginners class to ask the teacher-weachers here for helpy-welpy.${prompt}
  9792: They told me to go ask Professor-wessor Koru-Moru. My brainy-wain is all in a bustle-wustle.${prompt}
  9793: Ah! Have you sniffed out the slippery Sedal-Godjal?${prompt}
  9794: |-
    ...I see.
    So that's why he gave up the principal position at the Aurastery and parted for parts unknown.${prompt}
  9795: Of course, it's still unforgivable! However, since he seems to be regretting his actions and can't actually move from where he is, I guess we have to leave it at that.${prompt}
  9796: Now, please return the magic doll.${prompt}
  9797: '...Excuse me? You declare that the doll once gave you deceitful directions?${prompt}'
  9798: That's strange. It was thoroughly tested before I entrusted it to you. The easiest explanation is that the doll sensed an emanation of energy exceeding that of the ring.${prompt}
  9799: |-
    In closing, there is the case of Mojiji...
    With the sudden cessation of Mojiji's correspondence, Professor Koru-Moru slid into an unsettling slump.${prompt}
  9800: Let me just say that some of us struck on the same solution as sly old Sedal-Godjal...${prompt}
  9801: |-
    I overheard you talking about Sedal-Godjal before.
    He always worried about things that I would just ignore.
    On issues such as student satisfaction he would ponder,
    I personally don't have that much precious time to squander.${prompt}
  9802: |-
    I always say that keeping expectations low is best.
    By keeping to this simple rule, you'll never see me stressed.${prompt}
  9803: Sedal-Godjal had a completely different nature to Professor Koru-Moru. I supposingly suppose that some people just can't enduringly endure certain hardships.${prompt}
  9804: |-
    ...Hm? Me?
    I have overcomingly overcome such trivial trivialities.
    I am aware that all things in this world are transiently transient.${prompt}
  9805: I'm so relieved that Sedal-Godjal was alright. I was worried that he'd met his demise in some horrible beastman's cookpot.${prompt}
  9806: '...There''s a mission here from Minister Apururu of the Manustery.${prompt}'
  9807: This mission hasn'taru actually been authorized by the Sibyl Guards. I've talked it over with the other gatehouse guards, and this is what we've decided...${prompt}
  9808: ${name-player}, please do everything in your power to help Minister Apururu.${prompt}
  9809: Please go to the Manustery. Minister Apururu is waiting for you.${prompt}
  9810: I also ask that you keep this mission a secretaru, especially from the Sibyl Guards.${prompt}
  9811: I can't bear to see Miss Apururu's tears. I'll personally taru and feather anyone who messes with my Apururu!${prompt}
  9812: |-
    I detestaru that Ajido-marujido.
    This is all his fault!${prompt}
  9813: Minister Apururu hates it when people call her “Miss Minster Apururu,” so everybody leaves off the “Miss”.${prompt}
  9814: |-
    She's also the youngest of the five ministers, but probably works the hardest at managing her ministry.
    It's still in the red, though...${prompt}

  9816: Have you, like, brought me a letter from the Chieftainness in Kazham?${prompt}
  9817: |-
    ...Huh?
    You're telling me the Temple of Uggalepih is totally crawling with icky monsters and stuff?${prompt}
  9818: |-
    What a drag!
    ...But no, Angelica is not a girl who gives up that easily!
    It's been my lifelong dream to have that exhibition!${prompt}
  9819: I'm not gonna change my mind. This is, like, a test to see whether I fall on my face, or spread my wings like a psychedelic butterfly!${prompt}
  9820: You just wait right there. I'm gonna write a reply, and I want you to, like, take it back to Kazham for me, okay?${prompt}
  9821: |-
    D'ya wanna hear my plan?
    With my paintings, that temple is gonna go from being a moldy old ruin to, like, a center for modern art.${prompt}
  9822: Each piece will take totally ages, but real perfecto art takes real dedication, y'know? I'm ready for the long haul.${prompt}
  9823: |-
    I'm not gonna throw away my dream!
    I'm gonna paint the canvas with my ambition!
    Hand me my brushes! Bring on the inspiration!${prompt}
  9824: Mana Orbs...!!!${prompt}
  9825: |-
    Hmph!!!
    What the hell do you know about Mana Orbs!?${prompt}
  9826: |-
    ...Unbelievable!
    After I specifically told those little brats at the port not to talk to anyone about this!${prompt}
  9827: |-
    ...What did you say!?
    You're friends with those meddlesome minors?
    Hmph! Aren't you embarrassed to tell people you hang around with kids at your age?${prompt}
  9828: |-
    Well, that's your business, I guess.
    If you're buddy-wuddies with those whippersnappers, I have only this to say to you:
    Give me back my Mana Orb!${prompt}
  9829: 'For the past few years, I''ve given ${item-plural: 1[2]} to the thief from Windurst Woods, Nanaa Mihgo, and had her search the towers of Sarutabaruta...${prompt}'
  9830: When I thought I finally had one within my grasp, that idiot Mithra dropped it somewhere! Do you know how much trouble I went through to find out it was those S.O.B.'s who had picked it up!?${prompt}
  9831: |-
    I'm not letting this mattaru drop!
    You can deliver a message to them...${prompt}
  9832: GIVE ME BACK MY MANA O～RB!${prompt}
  9833: For years I've had Nanaa Mihgo search...${prompt}
  9834: |-
    Just thinking of that moronic Mithra losing my precious Mana Orb, only to have it claimed by a bunch of anklebiters...
    Argh, it makes my blood boil!${prompt}
  9835: What the hell is this?${prompt}
  9836: Are you trying to tell me to give up on my Mana Orb by giving me this?${prompt}
  9837: |-
    You've got Yagudo droppings for brains, stripling!
    This has nothing to do with money!${prompt}
  9838: 'And while I''m at it, you might as well know that I gave Nanaa Mihgo one ${item-singular: 1[2]} every week as payment for searching for that Mana Orb!${prompt}'
  9839: |-
    Take a look over here!
    Feast your eyes on all the wonderful goods that I possess!
    I'm rich beyond your wildest dreams!
  9840: 'I''ve got so many ${item-plural: 1[2]}, I''m throwing them away! Here, take one if it''ll make you disappear and leave me be!${prompt}'
  9841: Hm? What're you making that face for?${prompt}
  9842: I'll take this to the Manustery! It's a crime against Cardians to have a Mana Orb. You'll probably get thrown into prison and made to break rocks all day!${prompt}
  9843: |-
    You've got Yagudo droppings for brains, stripling!
    This has nothing to do with money!${prompt}
  9844: I can take this to the Manustery, you know! That is, if you don't mind those S.O.B.'s getting into hot water for hiding a Mana Orb!${prompt}
  9845: '...!?${prompt}'
  9846: You used that Mana Orb on a Cardian!?${prompt}
  9847: Er, I'm s-sorry.${prompt}
  9848: |-
    ...Unbelievable...
    All that incredible power... Wasted on a useless puppet... A puppet...${prompt}
  9849: |-
    That's it!
    Disassemble that Cardian right this instantaru!${prompt}
  9850: Then pull out the Mana Orb and bring it here to me! You got that!?${prompt}
  9851: |-
    How can you say that!?
    Diss-a-sem-bull means to take something apart, doesn't it?${prompt}
  9852: Joker will die if we do that!${prompt}
  9853: |-
    Here's a linkshell, tell somebody who cares!
    You've got no clue of the value of that Mana Orb, and I don't need to hear your meaningless sniveling!${prompt}
  9854: That Mana Orb is more than it appears to be. Its worth is incalculable!${prompt}
  9855: Go and start taking that automaton to pieces! You hear me!${prompt}
  9856: I can't diss-a-sem-bull Joker, I just can't!${prompt}
  9857: What am I going to do...?${prompt}
  9858: Go and start taking that automaton to pieces! You hear me?${prompt}
  9859: |-
    ...You again!
    What do you want with me now? Have you come to stand up for those S.O.B.'s? You're wasting your time!${prompt}
  9860: Unless, of course, you're willing to listen to my offer. I'll make it worth your while, so you'd be smart to take me up on it.${prompt}
  9861: |-
    Take the offer?
    ${selection-lines}
    Worth my while...?
    No thanks, ya big meanie.${prompt}
  9862: You're not going to amount to much as an adventurer if you don't recognize your opportunities.${prompt}
  9863: |-
    Well now, an adventurer worthy of the name.
    You realize you have to look at things with a cool head on your shoulders.${prompt}
  9864: If what those S.O.B.'s say is true, I doubt they'll be able to disassemble that Cardian on their own.${prompt}
  9865: I don't know too much about Cardians, but I'm sure it won't just sit there quietly while someone tries to take it to pieces. More than likely it'll lash out and we'll have all sorts of trouble on our hands.${prompt}
  9866: This is where you come in. To keep the little moppets safe, you're going to have to be the one to do it.${prompt}
  9867: They'll probably be upset with you for a long while, but they'll get over it. Surely you don't want to see them suffer over this mess any longer.${prompt}
  9868: If you care for those kids, you'll take it upon yourself to do the dirty work... That's what adults are there for, right?${prompt}
  9869: If you care for those kids, you'll take it upon yourself to do the dirty work... That's what adults are there for, right?${prompt}
  9870: Unbelievable!${prompt}
  9871: You're refusing to carry out the task you've already agreed to?${prompt}
  9872: |-
    And you call yourself an adventurer?
    Only a fool would pass up the chance to work for me.${prompt}
  9873: |-
    ...Fine, then.
    There's no sense going on about it. Plenty of other adventurers out there. I'll just find myself one with a backbone.${prompt}
  9874: |-
    This conversation is over.
    Go live with your S.O.B. friends in your happy little fantasy world. That's more your level.${prompt}
  9875: |-
    This conversation is over.
    Go live with your S.O.B. friends in your happy little fantasy world. That's more your level.${prompt}
  9876: |-
    This is awful!
    Whatever is the Rhinostery to do...?${prompt}
  9877: We...could...ask...the...minister...${prompt}
  9878: |-
    It's too late for thataru!
    I've had a terrible premonition. If we don't act quickly, our city will be swallowed by darkness.${prompt}
  9879: |-
    What's all this fuss and noise I hear?
    An emergency, huh? What's there to fear?${prompt}
  9880: |-
    Leepe-Hoppe, where have you been?
    There's globby-wobs of miteslime all over the Priming Gate. The other side of the gate must be teeming with them.${prompt}
  9881: Miteslime...is...the...secretion...of...the...starmite...bug...${prompt}
  9882: The...starmite...is an...insect...that...feeds...on...tree...roots...${prompt}
  9883: |-
    Oh my Goddess, this cannot be!
    You know the roots of the Great Star Tree,
    Are found beyond the Priming Gate,
    In Toraimarai Canal, oh why, cruel fate?${prompt}
  9884: |-
    Exactly-wactly!
    With the magic disappearing from the water around here, Toraimarai Canal has stagnated.${prompt}
  9885: 'But the real question is: Why on Vana''diel has the magic evaporated?${prompt}'
  9886: Whatever the reason, we are the only ones in Windurst rightaru now who can deal with this problem.${prompt}
  9887: Desperate times call for desperate measures. I think we should give this adventurer full Rhinostery authorization.${prompt}
  9888: Then we can have ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] exterminataru the bugs in Toraimarai Canal and pay ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] an appropriate reward.${prompt}
  9889: |-
    Full Rhinostery authorization, you say?
    And hand ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, come what may?${prompt}
  9890: |-
    What else can we do?
    It would take agey-wages to call back the researchers from the field.${prompt}
  9891: |-
    It...should be...okay...to give...emergency...authorization...to enter...the canal...
    Should be...${prompt}
  9892: |-
    You're rightaru, this is an emergency.
    If this adventurer is up to it, let's give ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] Rhinostery authorization.${prompt}
  9893: |-
    Alrighty-wighty?
    Will you work on our behalf?
    We want you to go bug-bashing-berserk in Toraimarai Canal.${prompt}
  9894: |-
    Work for the Rhinostery?
    ${selection-lines}
    You called for an exterminator?
    Ewww, bugs!${prompt}
  9895: |-
    ......
    There are other adventurers who have worked for us in the past. We can try asking them, I suppose.${prompt}
  9896: 'Greataru! Please use this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}. If you show it to the Cardian at the Priming Gate and explain the emergency, it should let you in.${prompt}'
  9897: 'Collect three ${item-plural: 2[2]} from the starmites you squash, and we''ll pay you ${number: 0} gil.${prompt}'
  9898: 'That ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} is proof that you are working for the Rhinostery. Show it to the Cardian on guard, and it will open the Priming Gate for you.${prompt}'
  9899: 'Enter Toraimarai Canal and squish those starmites. Gather three ${item-plural: 2[2]} from the bugs you bash, and we''ll pay you ${number: 0} gil.${prompt}'
  9900: |-
    Our offer to you still stands.
    Will you work under Rhinostery authorization?
    You've always helped us before, rightaru?${prompt}
  9901: Great...discoveries...are...being made...all...over...${prompt}
  9902: Researchers...researching...fauna...have it...tough...${prompt}
  9903: So...adventurers...with...Rhinostery...authorization...${prompt}
  9904: have...all...left...Windurst...to help...${prompt}
  9905: |-
    Lately, I've had so many dreams.
    But I don'taru remember them when I wake up...${prompt}
  9906: |-
    I don't think I wantaru remember what I dreamed about.
    Maybe I'm subconsciously trying to forget them...${prompt}
  9907: |-
    The ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} is not a toy,
    So use it properly, and be a good boy!${prompt}
  9908: |-
    The Rhinostery's name you have in your hands,
    Please use it with honor, as your conscience demands!
    If you handle yourself badly, and none-too-politely,
    The Cardian at the gate will not take it lightly!${prompt}
  9909: One, two, three...${prompt}
  9910: |-
    Thank you!
    You squishy-squished a lot of those starmites.${prompt}
  9911: |-
    Here's your reward...
    If possible, I'd like you to help us out again.${prompt}
  9912: '...!${prompt}'
  9913: You...made it...back...okay?${prompt}
  9914: Oh...good...${prompt}
  9915: Ohbiru-Dohbiru and Kenapa-Keppa are making a nutrient-rich salve to repair the bug-bitten roots.${prompt}
  9916: And Leepe-Hoppe is working on a smelly-welly repellent to use on the starmites. Keep up the good work until their research is complete.${prompt}
  9917: |-
    Hmmm? Me?
    I'm the only meditation researcher, so I'll concentrate on my field of expertise--dreams.${prompt}
  9918: |-
    Doctor Yoran-Oran is going to study,
    Starmite ecology for the Rhinostery!${prompt}
  9919: |-
    Also, the fauna researchers are returning full speed,
    To Windurst, to help in our hour of need!
    I hope coming with them is the specialist guy,
    Who is versed in all things that concern Toraimarai!${prompt}
  9920: |-
    Are you willing to head back into Toraimarai Canal?
    I'll pay you ${number: 0} gil for every three ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt}

    Ahaha!
    That's what I like to hear from our Rhinostery adventurers.
    We're counting on you!${prompt}
  9923: Good...luck...!${prompt}
  9924: |-
    Hello, dearie! You're Pichichi's friend, aren't you?
    From the look on your face, I'd say there's a new Star Onion Brigade adventure brewing.${prompt}
  9925: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 2[2]}...
    Pichichi didn't ask for that, did she?
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 2[2]} is hard to make, even for me.${prompt}
  9926: 'Out of all the materials needed to make ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} is the most importantaru and the most difficultaru to find. Have you heard of it before?${prompt}'

  9931: |-
    Now, if I add this to this...
    Then...${wait-animation: 2}
  9932: |-
    Here you go!
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 2[2]} you can use to disappear from sight. One of the most useful gadgets in the Junior Investigator's Toolkit!${prompt}
  9933: Phew, I'm glad that worked. We would have been in a pickle if I had fizzled the synthesis and wasted those materials. Speaking of which, would you like a plate of rarab tail pickles before you go, dearie?${prompt}
  9934: |-
    Hrmm!
    What!? There's no reason for me to feel guilty!
    I have absolutaruly no intention of defying the will of the Star Sibyl!${prompt}
  9935: |-
    ...? What was that?
    You want me to lend you my ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} again?${prompt}
  9936: |-
    Hrmm, I know what you're up to!
    You want to go back to the Animastery, don't you!?${prompt}
  9937: There's no more reason for you to go there. In factaru, you really shouldn't. How would you talk yourself out of trouble-wouble if you happened to run into the Star Sibyl again?${prompt}
  9938: |-
    ...Hrmm! What's that!?
    That's not the reason? You mean to break Ajido-Marujido out of the Dark Dungeon using my ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}!?${prompt}
  9939: |-
    ...Hmmm...
    The Dark Dungeon, huh? They say that the Dark Dungeon drains a person's magical power, eventually killing them...${prompt}
  9940: I doubtaru the Star Sibyl really intends to rob-wob Ajido-Marujido of his life. But she may be angry enough to rob him of his life as a mage.${prompt}
  9941: |-
    Hrmm!?

    I've been meaning to ask, my adventurer friend,
    Have you met our researchers beyond this land's end?${prompt}

    I speak of the scholars who brave ice, wind, and heat.
    They study protocrystals. They're the best, our elite.${prompt}

    Well, that justaru won't do.
    Come see me again when you know who's who.${prompt}
  10100: |-
    We have this new theory that'll make your mind race:
    The crystals contain a dimensional space!${prompt}
  10101: |-
    This dimension exists in Vana'diel, we think,
    as a home for great beings--as some kind of link.${prompt}
  10102: |-
    “Avatars” is the name that we've chosen to call
    these dimensional beings. And the reason is all...${prompt}
  10103: |-
    ...because of this ${item-singular: 1[2]}. This gem.
    If you sit still and listen, you just might hear him...${prompt}
  10104: Collect the whispers...

    The voice of ${item-singular: 1[2]}, could you hear what it said?
    It never stops droning those words in my head!${prompt}
  10109: |-
    This world's protocrystals number six in all.
    Six Avatars lay dormant, awaiting your call...${prompt}

    Gather the “whispers.” What could they be?
    I'm afraid that the word has no meaning to me.${prompt}
  10111: |-
    If, my brave soul, you are able to find
    these six phantom whispers, then drop me a line.${prompt}

    With this ${item-singular: 1[2]} begging for aid,

  10142: Vana'diel belongs to you as much as it belongs to us. You must see the true nature of your world.${prompt}
  10143: In time, you will come to understand that Vana'diel must be returned to its true form. You will understand what you were born to do.${prompt}

    Only truly dauntless dungeon-delvers get that, kupo!${prompt}

    Here, take this as a testament to your courage.
    Exchange it for the item your partner received so you can prove that you both reached the goal safely, kupo!${prompt}
  10263: Return with the evidence of your success to the moogle in town. Handing over your partner's item will prove that you were both able to reach me, kupo!${prompt}
  10264: |-
    Oh, and here's a picture of how your partner's face looked when I popped out of nowhere to scare you. You should hand this in at the same time, kupo!

  10319: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  10320: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  10321: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  10322: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  10323: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  10324: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  10325: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  10326: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  10327: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  10328: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  10329: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  10330: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  10331: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  10332: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  10333: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  10334: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  10335: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  10336: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  10337: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  10338: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  10339: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  10340: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  10341: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'

  10343: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  10344: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  10345: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
  10346: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}

  10348: Ballista is an exercise once used by the San d'Orian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word “ballista” means “to throw a stone,” and the game has been a part of Vana'dielian military history for centuries.${prompt}
  10349: |-
    The rules are simple.
    Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vana'diel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.${prompt}
  10350: 'Players from both teams must search for ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} that a ${color: 5}Herald${color: 1} has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  10351: 'These ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} into them.${prompt}'
  10352: Finally, a player's strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.${prompt}
  10353: '${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the ${color: 5}Quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.${prompt}'
  10354: 'Sometimes a player may find items other than ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}, such as potions. These ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).${prompt}'
  10355: |-
    Players can carry more than one ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, but they cannot throw the stones away once they have obtained them.
    However, players will lose their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} if they:
    (1) Successfully throw them into a rook.
    (2) Leave the area.
    (3) Are knocked out.${prompt}
  10356: 'But don''t forget, a player will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command while in possession of a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. And, players can only use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command if they carry one of the stones.${prompt}'
  10357: As one can see, careful planning and impeccable timing are the keys to victory.${prompt}
  10358: 'All participants of Ballista will have the ability to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. This will temporarily increase one''s movement speed, creating a better chance to find and obtain ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  10359: 'However, remember that once a player has obtained a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, he or she will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. In its place, though, one may use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command.${prompt}'
  10360: 'The locations of the ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} are constantly changing. This makes it quite difficult to find the targets by just randomly walking about the area.${prompt}'
  10361: 'Communication with one''s team members is, of course, one way to locate ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}. However, another way is by using the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command. This will inform a player of the approximate location of the nearest ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  10362: 'Finally, ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} can only be used when a player is carrying a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. Because ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used at this time, players must be weary of approaching enemies.${prompt}'
  10363: 'So, a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} has been obtained and a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1} located. Now all that''s left is tossing the stone in, right? Wrong.${prompt}'
  10364: There is one aspect of Ballista that has yet to be mentioned...and this is where the real battle begins.${prompt}
  10365: 'To throw a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} into a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}, a player must first wait until the ${color: 5}Rook''s${color: 1} gate is open. This takes impeccable timing, as the gate is only open for a short while.${prompt}'
  10366: |-
    But not just anyone can score points this way. A player must first take down a member of the opposing team and achieve ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status.
    Only then will his or her shots count.${prompt}
  10367: This extreme method of combat is what made the ancient game of Ballista famous, and transformed its participants into heroes.${prompt}
  10368: Running about looking for stones is no different from a child's game of hide-and-seek. Knowing when to strike is what separates the men from the boys.${prompt}
  10369: |-
    The following match types are area-specific:
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Allowed: Jugner Forest
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Restricted: Pashhow Marshlands
    Best of Three (three matches) * Normal Items Allowed: Meriphataud Mountains${prompt}
  10370: |-
    ${color: 5}Best of Three${color: 1} series rules are as follows:
    Winning a match will earn a nation one “match point.” The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for “come-from-behind” victories.${prompt}
  10371: Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nation's forces.${prompt}
  10372: Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.${prompt}
  10373: When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.${prompt}
  10374: For more information on temporary items, refer to the “special rules.”${prompt}
  10375: After being KO'd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.${prompt}
  10376: If a player chooses to return to their force's camp, HP and MP will be fully restored, but all TP will be lost.${prompt}

    Hrrrmmmmmm...hrm!${prompt}

    I can't seem to concentrate on my work today.

  10545: Father!${prompt}
  10546: Dad, we missed you!${prompt}
  10547: Daddy, your beautiful children are here!${prompt}
  10548: |-
    Hrm!?

  10549: You probably didn't know it, Father, but we were in Mother's tummy when you were separated.${prompt}
  10550: In Mommy's tummy!${prompt}
  10551: And that's why we've been looking for you all this time!${prompt}
  10552: Looking for you, Daddy!${prompt}
  10553: |-
    H-hold on a moment!
    You think that I'm your father!?
    I'm old enough to be your grandfather!${prompt}
  10554: Grandpappy?${prompt}
  10555: Could he be our grandpa?${prompt}
  10556: We've come all the way from Tavnazia to look for our father...${prompt}

    Hrmmmm!?
    Tavnazia!? I'm afraid neither I nor my daughter have ever been to Tavnazia...${prompt}
  10558: |-
    That's weird.
    We heard that our father was the Minister of the Optistery...${prompt}
  10559: You're not our dad, Minister Karaha-Baruha!?${prompt}
  10560: |-
    Hrm!?
    Karaha-Baruha!? You three are the children of Karaha-Baruha!?${prompt}
  10561: |-
    That's right!
    Our father is Karaha-Baruha!${prompt}
  10562: That's why our lives are in danger!${prompt}
  10563: That's why we came looking for our daddy to help us!${prompt}
  10564: |-
    How could Karaha-Baruha have children...
    I'm flabbergasted...
    Now that I think about it, he did mention something about a trip to Tavnazia...${prompt}
  10565: |-
    He said he'd had an encounter that would change the history of Vana'diel's people.
    Could he have meant his meeting with your mother? Hrm!${prompt}
  10566: Oh, my poor little ones. I have some terrible news for you.${prompt}
  10567: The great and powerful Karaha-Baruha passed away twenty years ago...${prompt}
  10568: He perished from the incredible summoning magic he used to save our beloved Windurst.${prompt}
  10569: Karaha-Baruha is dead!?${prompt}
  10570: He died from using summoning magic!?${prompt}
  10571: We're doomed!${prompt}
  10572: |-
    I'm sure you are terribly-werribly shaken by all this...
    My sincere condolences, children of Karaha-Baruha.${prompt}
  10573: |-
    But do not despair.
    As the successor of all matters relating to the Optistery, I will do everything in my power to aid you.${prompt}
  10574: Everything in your power?${prompt}
  10575: You don't seem to be powerful at all, Grandpa.${prompt}
  10576: And you don't look rich either, Grandpappy.${prompt}
  10577: |-
    Hrm!
    I suppose I have no more power or money than most people...${prompt}
  10578: |-
    However, I am known as the “Fountain of Knowledge”!

  10580: |-
    Hmmm.
    Okay, who are the Kuluu?${prompt}
  10581: The Kuluu were an ancient race that no longer exists in our time.${prompt}
  10582: What about the Zilart?${prompt}
  10583: That is also the name of an ancient race that no longer exists in our time.${prompt}
  10584: How about Bahamut?${prompt}
  10585: That would be the name of the ancient king of the wyrms that no longer exists in our time.${prompt}
  10586: Amazing.${prompt}
  10587: You managed to get every question wrong.${prompt}
  10588: What!? What are you talking about!?${prompt}
  10589: 'One more question: Who is Nag''molada?${prompt}'
  10590: |-
    Nag'molada... Hrm!?
    Isn't that the name of a Jeunoan diplomat? I believe he was responsible for adjudicating talks between the three nations during the time of the war...${prompt}
  10591: |-
    Wow!
    I knew he was somebody important!${prompt}
  10592: He's important, powerful, and rich!${prompt}
  10593: He could've been our daddy if he were a Tarutaru!${prompt}
  10594: |-
    What are you whispering about?
    Have you come to realize my greatness, children of Karaha-Baruha?${prompt}
  10595: |-
    Um, yeah.
    We're gonna head for Jeuno now, Grandfather!${prompt}
  10596: Head for Jeuno!
  10597: Jeuno!${prompt}
  10598: Kuluu, Zilart, Bahamut... Those are all names found in my dustiest and mustiest of tomes--and those tomes say that all three perished long, long ago!${prompt}
  10599: I'm not going to believe any of this rubbly rubbish unless someone brings one of those Zilart here before my eyes!${prompt}
  10600: |-
    Whoa!
    Your aura is blinding!
    What on Vana'diel are you carrying!?${prompt}
  10601: Look, I can't sleep with you standing there like a muddled mandragora.${prompt}
  10602: |-
    Hm?
    You're looking for a girl with crikey-spiky hair you could use as nails?${prompt}
  10603: |-
    Oh, I know the one.
    She was taken to Doctor Yoran-Oran's mansion.${prompt}
  10604: |-
    But are you a friend of hers?
    That girl is a disastaru waiting to happen.
    Unlike the light I see in your aura, she is surrounded by a dark, creepy-weepy cloud.${prompt}
  10605: It is that very cloud of doom and gloom that has made her a target of the great being I see in my dreams.${prompt}
  10606: But now that someone, somewhere has activatarued the ruins of Pso'Xja, that great being can no longer act freely-weely.${prompt}
  10607: The being is so furious-wurious over losing its prey, I don'taru think I'll be seeing any pleasantaru dreams for a while...${prompt}
  10608: |-
    I told them that girl was a disastaru waiting to happen, but did they listen? No～ooo.
    I'm just going to wash my hands of the whole thing.${prompt}
  10609: Hey, you're the mangy adventurer that was with Sir Louverance. You're not getting in his way now, are you? Hm?${prompt}
  10610: He said that he was heading on business for a tiny island to the southeast of Mhaura. You'd better not be thinking of following him!${prompt}
  10611: |-
    We've been busy lately, with no time for fun.
    So today is a day for just soaking up sun.${prompt}
  10612: |-
    You gotta help me, I'm in serious trouble.
    I'm headed for needles and my life is a bubble...${prompt}
  10613: |-
    When death is before you, it really is true.
    Your memories flash right before you, they do.${prompt}
  10614: |-
    This all occurred not a moment ago.
    I'll fill you in on my grim tale of woe...${prompt}
  10615: |-
    I was just standing here, in a half-asleep daze,
    When an ominous shadow blocked out the warm rays...${prompt}
  10616: It's r-r-rightaru this way!!!${prompt}
  10617: Y-y-you're on your own f-f-from here!!!${prompt}
  10618: |-
    Huh?
    This is the one rrresponsible for the tuning forks?${prompt}
  10619: You don't look particularly special or brrright to me.${prompt}
  10620: |-
    I'm really quite clever, though I don't look like much!
    And who might you be to pass judgment and such?${prompt}
  10621: |-
    Watch your tongue, sunshine!
    I am a Mithran Tracker!${prompt}
  10622: I'll harvest your head and have it drrrying on the windowsill before you can blink!${prompt}
  10623: <Gulp!>${prompt}
  10624: |-
    Why did you bring this sin hunter here!?
    Are you trying to make me keel over in fear?${prompt}
  10625: Ronta-Onta～!?${prompt}
  10626: |-
    Let me clear things up for you.
    I have come from the Mithran homeland.${prompt}
  10627: |-
    I met that Tarutaru in Kazham, where I was looking into tuning forks.
    He told me you were the specialist in the field.${prompt}
  10628: |-
    I'm not the patient type, kiddo.
    You will tell me everything you know about these devices.${prompt}
  10629: <Gulp!>${prompt}
  10630: |-
    Hmmm, I see.
    So these tuning forks can't actually be used to split the protocrystals?${prompt}
  10631: After going through my inquisition this many times, I guess you must be telling the truth.${prompt}
  10632: '...${prompt}'
  10633: But I want to shatter the protocrystals.${prompt}
  10634: |-
    How do you break them?
    Come on, think! There must be a way!${prompt}
  10635: |-
    I'm telling you, what you're asking can't be done.
    Do you think I'm repeating myself just for fun...?${prompt}
  10636: |-
    If you must insist on asking again,
    I'll explain it once more. Here, use my pen!${prompt}
  10637: |-
    The crystal's interior is an avatar's domain.
    An alternate dimension not found on this plane.${prompt}
  10638: |-
    These realms are each pulsing with elemental might.
    Comparatively, the same power in this world is slight.${prompt}
  10639: |-
    That's why protocrystals won't break from out here!
    They're indestructible! Am I making this clear?${prompt}
  10640: |-
    Unless the great beings themselves wish it so,
    The crystals resist any physical blow!${prompt}
  10641: Is that right...?${prompt}
  10642: '...${prompt}'
  10643: Then you'll just have to convince the avatars to listen to you, won't you, sugar?${prompt}
  10644: |-
    Convince those great beings to listen to me...?
    Do you really think it'll be that easy?${prompt}
  10645: |-
    Listen, sweetcakes.
    Do you have any idea what I've been through to get to this point?${prompt}
  10646: I have visited almost every single protocrystal there is.${prompt}
  10647: But your great beings--the sleeping gods--won't listen to a word I have to say.${prompt}
  10648: They just spout out nonsensical questions and answers. It's as if they don't even rrrealize I'm there.${prompt}
  10649: You rrresearchers don't intend to participate in this farce forever, do you?${prompt}
  10650: If you think hard enough, there is an answer for everything.${prompt}
  10651: |-
    Now, you better start thinking like your life depends on it! Because it does, sweetheart.
    It's your job to figure out prrroblems, right?${prompt}
  10652: <Gulp!>${prompt}
  10653: |-
    Alrightaru, don't get your tail in a twist!
    Give me back my pen and I'll start on a list.${prompt}
  10654: |-
    So, your goal is to be able to have a straight talk?
    I'll need to start work on a new tuning fork!${prompt}
  10655: |-
    A device of raw power beyond any I've made!
    I can't promise you'll survive it unscathed, I'm afraid!${prompt}
  10656: |-
    There you go, twinkletoes.
    See what you can accomplish with the thrrreat of death looming over you?${prompt}
  10657: |-
    This is the kind of thing I live for.
    With a job that calls for constant battle, my life is always on the line!${prompt}
  10658: |-
    See you later, sweetcheeks.
    Be sure to let me know when the tuning fork is rrready.${prompt}
  10659: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}...${prompt}'
  10660: |-
    These will be all the materials I'll need!
    My new tuning fork formula must succeed!${prompt}
  10661: |-
    Adventurer, you heard all three items I stated?
    Your visit today must've surely been fated!${prompt}
  10662: |-
    Bring me those items, I humbly implore you!
    I swear on my name that I'll pay you your due!${prompt}
  10663: |-
    Where in the world can I find these three things...?
    They're almost as rare as dread dragon wings.${prompt}
  10664: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}...${prompt}'

    I'd even be willing to pay finder's fees...${prompt}
  10666: |-
    Thank you! Oh, thank you! Here, take your reward!
    In Altana's grace, my faith you've restored!${prompt}
  10667: |-
    Now it is time for my revenge to be felt!
    I'll hand the great beings that sin hunter's pelt!${prompt}
  10668: |-
    Thank you! Oh, thank you! Here, take your reward!
    In Altana's grace, my faith you've restored!${prompt}
  10669: |-
    Now it is time for my revenge to be felt!
    I'll hand the great beings that sin hunter's pelt!${prompt}
  10670: |-
    I wonder what happened? Where could she be?
    I guess it's fair justice for threatening me...${prompt}
  10671: |-
    Ah, it's you! My adventuring friend!
    Perhaps to my worries an ear you could lend?${prompt}
  10672: |-
    I finished the fork, then I handed it to,
    That Mithran sin hunter. She was pleased, I tell you.${prompt}
  10673: |-
    She packed up the fork, and then left right away.
    I've not seen her since that most harrowing day...${prompt}
  10674: |-
    Of course, that new fork has never been tested.
    I hope that it worked in the way she requested...${prompt}
  10675: |-
    It's possible the Mithra has been trapped inside.
    I would just forget it. And oh, how I've tried!${prompt}
  10676: |-
    But I can't leave a lady to such a grim fate.
    So I've called upon stalwart Ildy-Goldy the Great!${prompt}
  10677: |-
    Do you know of our Ildy, the one and the only?
    He protects us on trips to lands far, wild, and lonely!${prompt}
  10678: |-
    With his fighting skills he's sure to compete,
    On a level that rivals the Mithra elite!${prompt}
  10679: |-
    Plus, they both wear those creepy black helms.
    I'm sure that they've traveled in similar realms.${prompt}
  10680: Vhat vas that aboutaru creepy helms...?${prompt}
  10681: |-
    Oh! Ildy-Goldy, have you made any progress?
    Have you found that formidable Mithra sin huntress?${prompt}
  10682: |-
    It is mostaru veird.
    I did speak vith several persons who had seen a dark-helmeted Mithra...${prompt}
  10683: The Rhinostery researchers in Beaucedine say she vas headed in the direction of Xarcabard.${prompt}
  10684: |-
    Xarcabard? Why'd she go there?
    Fei'Yin is the spot for an avatar's lair.${prompt}
  10685: |-
    ...
    Vhen I vas still a student, I vonce read a thesis written by Professor Iru-Kuiru.${prompt}
  10686: It talked of the Mithran belief that a crystal of darkness exists in Xarcabard.${prompt}
  10687: Iru-Kuiru vas on friendly-viendly terms vith the Mithra of Kazham.${prompt}
  10688: It might be bestaru to try speaking vith them about this matter.${prompt}
  10689: |-
    Now that you mention it, I'm fairly sure,
    Our sin hunter came from that southerly shore.${prompt}
  10690: |-
    Vell then, it's settled.
    Adventurer, come and meet me in Kazham.
    The chieftainness may have some answer-vanswers for us.${prompt}
  10691: |-
    Don'taru forget to put safety first.
    Like poor Iru-Kuiru, try not to get cursed.${prompt}
  10692: |-
    An allied expedition member was he.
    A researcher from our beloved Rhinostery.${prompt}
  10693: |-
    If you want to help Ildy along,
    Put on your trunks and swim to Kazham!${prompt}
  10694: |-
    The triumphant adventurer returns from his quest!
    Ildy told us you passed every trial and test!${prompt}
  10695: |-
    As thanks for your help in this troublesome case,
    Here's a helmet that sells at incredible pace!${prompt}

  10740: Recently, there's been a lot of strange characters running around Windurst...even more than usual! I just hope that none of them try to steal this special order I'm supposed to deliver, kupo!${prompt}
  10741: |-
    You've come to pick up the order? Are you sure you're not one of those strange characters with the hats, kupo?
    Well, who am I to judge? Here you go, kupo!${prompt}
  10742: |-
    Hm?
    Did I forget something...?
    ...No, you've got the whole order, kupo.${prompt}
  10743: Have you seen any crazy Goblins riding around on chocobos lately, kupo?${prompt}
  10744: Oh, you don't have to worry. They probably won't attack you. They're playing a game with us moogles, kupo!${prompt}
  10745: You see, we take these cards and bury them around the outskirts of town. Then the Goblins go out and try to find them. If they do, they can bring them back to us and exchange them for different prizes, kupo.${prompt}
  10746: This time, we spread them out all over the area, thinking that the Gobs wouldn't be able to cover that much land, kupo.${prompt}
  10747: But that was before we learned that they had their own chocobos!${prompt}
  10748: It's just not fair, kupo!${prompt}
  10749: Now it's only a matter of time before those stinking beastmen find all the cards and we moogles lose the game, kupo!${prompt}
  10750: |-
    And that's why we need your help, kupo!
    Would you go out into the field and find the cards before the Goblins do?${prompt}

  10752: 'For starters, why don''t you try finding ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}? That should throw those smelly Gobs for a real spin, kupo!${prompt}'
  10753: |-
    Great! A whole set, kupo!
    Ah, I wish I could be there to see the look on those Gobs' faces when all they find is an empty hole.
    Oh, right! Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt}
  10754: |-
    If you have any extra time on your hands, try finding more card sets, kupo!
    We really have to stick it to those Gobs this year to show them who's boss!${prompt}
  10755: |-
    Wow! Another set!
    You don't know how much this means to us, kupo!
    Here, take this!${prompt}
  10756: |-
    Have you seen the decorations?
    The Doll Festival has started, kupo!${prompt}
  10757: I heard from my moogle sources that this is a celebration for the health and happiness of girls, kupo.${prompt}
  10758: Apparently, the young lady and her beau would play empress and emperor, and would be joined by eight of their friends for the festivities, kupo.${prompt}
  10759: |-
    Why don't you try making a ten-person party as well?
    We can all have fun celebrating the Doll Festival, kupo!${prompt}
  10760: |-
    It looks like you have all the members you need.
    Time for the festival to begin, kupo!${prompt}

    After squeezing my moogle sources some more, they told me that people used to eat these during the festival.
    Here, you take one as well, kupo!${prompt}
  10762: It looks like you have all the members you need, kupo!${prompt}
  10763: In fact, the moogle grapevine tells me that this is the perfect Doll Festival combination, kupo!${prompt}
  10764: As a reward for your blind luc--I mean, “resourcefulness,” I'm going to give you lots of these treats, kupo!${prompt}
  10765: |-
    Just in case you didn't know, the three girls in your party represent ladies of the court who wait on the empress.
    Moogles know everything about festivals, kupo!${prompt}
  10766: |-
    And by the way, the five guys in your group represent musicians who entertain the empress and emperor.
    I wish I could play an instrument, kupo!${prompt}

    Kupo!?
    Something's not right...
    Ah! This is a girl's festival and you don't have a girl in your party, kupo!${prompt}

    Ooh, a shiny new adventurer!
    Join in the fun, kupo!${prompt}

    You can only celebrate the Doll Festival once a day.
    Try again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt}

    Hey!
    Your party has different members all of a sudden!
    Well, I guess I can give you this for having the right number of people at least, kupo!${prompt}
  10777: |-
    Hey!
    Your party has lost touch with its feminine side!
    You need to find yourself a lady, kupo!${prompt}
  10778: |-
    Hmm...
    You seem to have lost your male element.
    Can't have the guys running away from you, kupo!${prompt}
  10779: |-
    Kupopopo～!
    This is terrible!
    Vicious villains are venting violently outside the city walls, kupo!${prompt}
  10780: We've divined that these creatures are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt}
  10781: |-
    But never fear!
    Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these invaders!
    Behold the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]}, kupo!${prompt}
  10782: The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt}
  10783: But be warned--this magic has the side-effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole days, kupo!${prompt}
  10784: |-
    Here's your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.
    Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!${prompt}
  10785: 'The ${item-singular: 0[2]} will absorb a part of the villain''s aura every time you attack, kupo.${prompt}'
  10786: Even if you don't topple the terror, bring the weapon to a moogle and you'll get a reward to match the amount of aura you've absorbed, kupo!${prompt}
  10787: |-
    By the way, these monsters are running around in samurai-style armor.
    They may be hiding among other adventurers, so be on your guard, kupo!${prompt}
  10788: |-
    Here's a new ${item-singular: 0[2]}.
    Bring it back to a moogle if you deal any damage to those samurai-styled scoundrels, kupo!${prompt}
  10789: 'If you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!${prompt}'
  10790: Bring the weapon to a moogle after you've inflicted some damage to the marauding monsters and you'll get a reward to match the amount of aura you've absorbed, kupo!${prompt}
  10791: |-
    I can see the aura you've absorbed from the enemy!
    Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt}
  10792: |-
    With all the aura you've absorbed with the ${item-plural: 0[2]}, we've managed to create a new weapon.
    We'd like you to have it, kupo!${prompt}
  10793: |-
    Festival time, kupo～!!!
    We moogles have come up with a new game for you to enjoy called "Azimuth Circle"!${prompt}
  10794: |-
    Azimuth Circle is played in pairs!
    First, find a partner and make a party, kupo!${prompt}
  10795: After you've done that, try to find a certain checkpoint located in this town! There are many checkpoints, but only one right answer, kupo!${prompt}
  10796: However...you can only check three points, kupo! But don't worry--once you've checked a point, you can look at it again any number of times!${prompt}
  10797: At each location lies a compass that points in the direction of your partner's special checkpoint! The directions will be indicated from the viewpoint of your partner, kupo～.${prompt}
  10798: Find both of your special checkpoints and exchange the items you receive from them! Bring those items to us. We will give you a reward in exchange, kupo!${prompt}
  10799: |-
    That's all there is to it, kupo!
    To participate, make a party of two and talk to a moogle!${prompt}
  10800: |-
    That's all there is to it, kupo!
    Your partner seems to already be participating in the game.

    Ready to go!
    I'll pass.${prompt}
  10803: When both of you are ready, talk to a moogle! Then the game will begin, kupo!${prompt}
  10804: If you decide you want to play, just come with a friend, kupo!${prompt}
  10805: Our records indicate that you are presently signed up for Azimuth Circle somewhere else, kupo. Would you like to cancel your participation there?${prompt}
  10806: |-
    Well, kupo?
    You want to stop playing Azimuth Circle?${prompt}

    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, freedom!
    I'll keep playing, thanks.${prompt}

  10811: |-
    You must wait for your partner to finish, kupo!
    Would you like to cancel the current game instead?${prompt}
  10812: We can only pass out one item to you each day, kupo～!${prompt}

  10815: You see something lying on the ground!${prompt}
  10816: You cannot check any more checkpoints.${prompt}
  10817: Have you ever heard of Blitz Buffalo, kupo? It's a fast and frenzied buffalo-chasing fiasco ferried in from a land to the far west of Quon!${prompt}
  10818: We moogles thought it sounded like fun! So we rounded up a bunch of buffalos and set them loose in several places, kupo!${prompt}
  10819: Also, we've tied an item to each buffalo! Anyone who catches one can keep the item as a reward! It's a great opportunity for adventurers, kupo!${prompt}
  10820: But the buffalos aren't going to take a bunch of frantic adventurers chasing them lightly! You may have to knock one out before it yields its precious item, kupo!${prompt}
  10821: If you manage to lay your hands on a buffalo, you better prepare to be flung around, kupo... Kupohoho～.${prompt}
  10822: |-
    Of course, it wouldn't be too good if you ended up being the one chased either, kupo!
    Just take care, and good luck, kupo!${prompt}
  10823: It's time once again for the Starlight Celebration!${prompt}
  10824: We moogles have collected piles and piles of presents for the adventurers this time, kupo!${prompt}
  10825: We'd like to give them to each person individually, but everyone always seems to be off on some adventure or another, and we can't keep them all straight! Could you help us, kupo?${prompt}
  10826: Give this card to an adventurer and tell him or her to bring it to a moogle. We'll have a present waiting, kupo!${prompt}
  10827: There are four cards in all. Once you hand the first card out, I will ask the adventurer who brings it back to help with the next.${prompt}

    You should think hard about what to get them! You might say it's the thought that counts, but unfortunately, the children think otherwise!${prompt}

  11123: Tarutaru residences are built to accommodate even the tallest Elvaans. But why build shelves so high up...?${prompt}
  11124: |-
    Windurst is famous for its hat shop.
    I can never visit the city without popping in at least once to check the latest styles.${prompt}
  11125: |-
    The hat shop in Windurst Waters has hoods with little ears attached on display.
    Are they not for sale?${prompt}
  11126: |-
    The restaurant food in Windurst is prepared by the Culinarians' Guild.
    I never miss a chance to indulge in one of their superb dishes.${prompt}
  11127: |-
    There seems to be a lot of water in Windurst.
    What happens if there's a rainstorm and everything floods?
    It wouldn't take much to submerge a wee Tarutaru...${prompt}
  11128: |-
    Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars.
    The property prices must be astronomical.${prompt}
  11129: A large building seems to have been embedded inside the Great Star Tree. I wouldn't be surprised if the leg portion of the secret weapon is concealed within.${prompt}
  11130: When I travel to hot areas, my feet always sweat inside my boots. Then the sand gets in there and it drives me crazy...${prompt}
  11131: |-
    I'm ashamed to admit it but...I'm hopeless at riding chocobos.
    I have my license, though. Really.${prompt}
  11132: |-
    Hmm.
    I can't think of anything to talk about.${prompt}
  11133: It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.${prompt}
  11134: Because the weather in town is usually either clear or cloudy, there's no need to carry a change of equipment. But since it can be quite unpredictable out in the wilderness, it's good to be prepared.${prompt}
  11135: Just between you and me, I obtained my armor here through unconventional methods.${prompt}
  11136: The other day I had to dash to an outpost to avoid being drenched in a sudden downpour.${prompt}
  11137: Do you ever get the urge to just run around like a mad thing when the ground is covered with snow?${prompt}
  11138: |-
    I do so much prefer to speak with you face to face.
    The pearl can be a little impersonal at times.${prompt}
  11139: |-
    Are moogles considered to be beastmen?
    Is there a moogle king? A god of the moogles?${prompt}
  11140: It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.${prompt}
  11141: The other week I went to the Tenshodo to collect a pair of gloves I had ordered, only to discover they were closed for business that day.${prompt}
  11142: |-
    I have to change my shoes as soon as I get home or I can't relax.
    Does anything like that ever happen to you?${prompt}
  11143: |-
    And have you ever worried that the chocobo smell stays with you, even after you dismount?
    Maybe I'm being paranoid...${prompt}
  11144: |-
    ...
    Nope, the only thing that comes to mind is the weather.
    Not very interesting at all.${prompt}
  11145: |-
    Do you notice the change?
    I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.${prompt}
  11146: There's nothing I hate more than getting caught outside without the right gear for the weather.${prompt}
  11147: |-
    The range of goods is pretty good if you buy through this method.
    Unfortunately though, some items aren't always in stock, so you don't always get what you want.${prompt}
  11148: |-
    The guards wouldn't let me inside, if you can believe it!
    My best dress, ruined!${prompt}
  11149: |-
    But if you run around too much, your shoes get all soggy.
    And nobody likes soggy shoes now, do they?${prompt}
  11150: I like to be able to see what you're thinking.${prompt}
  11151: I wonder what kind of pet a moogle god would keep...${prompt}
  11152: |-
    Do you notice the change?
    I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.${prompt}
  11153: Of course, that didn't deter me in the least. I simply seized some of the staff and “persuaded” them to open shop.${prompt}
  11154: No one ever seems to want to swing a huge sword while wearing a tunic or a robe...${prompt}
  11155: I'm hopeless at keeping my room tidy, so I bought some furniture to store all my items.${prompt}
  11156: I went to the Blacksmiths' Guild the other day to have some armor repaired, but it turned out to be their day off.${prompt}
  11157: Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?${prompt}
  11158: I've got my eye on some new equipment, but they're way too expensive.${prompt}
  11159: I appreciate your concern for my equipment and all, but what about your own attire?${prompt}
  11160: |-
    Have you ever seen an aurora?
    It looks like a rainbow-colored curtain draped across the sky.${prompt}
  11161: |-
    I never know what to wear on windy days.
    I mean, you can't wear a skirt, right?${prompt}
  11162: |-
    I've noticed that beastmen seem to carry gil around.
    What on Vana'diel do they use it for?${prompt}
  11163: |-
    The smilebringers really exist, you know!
    They live somewhere far to the north!${prompt}
  11164: Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?${prompt}
  11165: In the Near East, a race of rat-like beastmen called Qiqirn live alongside common folk. Their information network is said to be impressive.${prompt}
  11166: |-
    I always thought it would look mysterious and unique.
    Maybe I just have no fashion sense...${prompt}
  11167: |-
    For some reason, my Mog House began to feel damp after that.
    Guess I bought too many vases...${prompt}
  11168: |-
    Why does that always happen on the very day you decide to go?
    Call me impatient, but I ended up just buying a new set of armor...${prompt}
  11169: You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.${prompt}
  11170: But if I wait a little longer, maybe the price will come down. It's pretty normal for items to become cheaper after a while.${prompt}
  11171: Why, you ask? Is it a crime to want your partner to look cool?${prompt}
  11172: |-
    I've heard they can weave cloth that looks just like it.
    You must be able to make beautiful clothes out of that material...${prompt}
  11173: Not that I ever wear skirts, anyway...${prompt}
  11174: |-
    Do they trade with people?
    I wonder what a beastman would buy...${prompt}
  11175: |-
    They dress in red robes and a red hat, and dance around in white subligaria.
    You believe me, don't you, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  11176: You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.${prompt}
  11177: |-
    But that reputation doesn't guarantee their information will always be accurate.
    After all, swindling isn't a race-exclusive occupation.${prompt}
  11178: |-
    You're probably thinking that I have a trunk full of armor.
    I actually trade my old gear in all the time.${prompt}
  11179: I've been meaning to tell you, but you shouldn't send me any deliveries.${prompt}
  11180: |-
    There are powerful enemies emerging all around us these days.
    We should keep up our training to avoid being overwhelmed in battle.${prompt}
  11181: |-
    It's so much easier to converse while we're within the city walls.
    No need to keep an eye on the surroundings.${prompt}
  11182: I've heard stories of people who can fight wyrms on even terms.${prompt}
  11183: You know, I'd love to visit your Mog House one day.${prompt}
  11184: You really feel like chatting today, I see.${prompt}
  11185: Do you eat out much?${prompt}
  11186: I've been trying different combinations of equipment, but I can't seem to make up my mind.${prompt}
  11187: |-
    What do you keep in your Mog House?
    Do you have furniture and stuff?${prompt}
  11188: |-
    It's so much easier to converse while we're within the city walls.
    No need to keep an eye on the surroundings.${prompt}
  11189: I usually spend my spare time on weapon maintenance and training. How do you spend yours?${prompt}
  11190: |-
    I have a friend in the business, you see.
    I'll introduce you sometime.${prompt}
  11191: The delivery people seem to have me mixed up with some other adventurer and I'm not getting my mail...${prompt}
  11192: |-
    Of course, I'll be there to fight beside you.
    Why don't we train together?${prompt}
  11193: I suppose we could always talk in a restaurant or a Mog House, but I've become quite attached to our informal meeting spot.${prompt}
  11194: To become strong like that, how many hours a day do you think I should spend leveling?${prompt}
  11195: |-
    M...my Mog House, you ask? Out of the question!
    It's a total mess, with month-old half-eaten scraps...and much worse!${prompt}
  11196: Well, you could at least offer up a topic for conversation occasionally!${prompt}
  11197: |-
    Even though we get so much exercise, I start gaining weight if I eat too much good food.
    Must be a metabolism thing...${prompt}
  11198: |-
    I have as many as four different sets worked out...
    I suppose using them in combat will help me to decide.${prompt}
  11199: |-
    It's probably filled with flowerpots, right?
    Or maybe you have one of those mannequins!${prompt}
  11200: I suppose we could always talk in a restaurant or a Mog House, but I've become quite attached to our informal meeting spot.${prompt}

  11582: Anyway, I totally understand your situation now. I'll redo the painting.${prompt}
  11583: This is a test of my brilliance as a painter. I accept!${prompt}
  11584: Now that I think about it, the original was total chocobo fodder anyway. I can, like, do so much better than that!${prompt}

  11621: It's about time you brought my painting! Show it to me!${prompt}
  11622: Oh, but what's the hurry? I've just arrived. Don't you want to sit back and relax a spell first? Take a deep breath, stretch out, maybe grab a few sips of tea...${prompt}
  11623: I don't know what kinda inane ideas they're feeding you young'uns today, but when I order a painting, I expect it to come on time, not three days late!${prompt}

    Okay! Okay!
    Here, I'll give it to you, so calm down. It goes without saying that you'll take good care of it, right?${prompt}

    Kupopopo～!
    This is terrible!
    Sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords, kupo!${prompt}

  12018: |-
    But never fear!
    Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans!
    Behold the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]}, kupo!${prompt}
  12019: The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt}

    The Sunbreeze Festival's main event is back and better than ever!${prompt}

  12025: Would you like to know more, kupo?${prompt}
  12026: |-
    Want to know more?
    ${selection-lines}
    Fill me in!
    I'm okay for now, kupo.${prompt}
  12027: To play Azimuth Circle II, you'll need to team up with a partner and use a compass to search for a specific point.${prompt}
  12028: So your first step is to find that special somebody and form a party!${prompt}
  12029: Then talk to an event moogle, and we'll send you both out of town, kupo!${prompt}
  12030: We've set up several checkpoints outside.${prompt}
  12031: The goal is to find the correct one, kupo!${prompt}
  12032: What's that? You want a hint to help you find your checkpoint? Never fear, kupo--that's where Azima's portable compass comes in!${prompt}
  12033: And it couldn't be easier to use! All the adventurers have to do is sit there and wait!${prompt}
  12034: Once the compass has stabilized, it will give you a hint to help you find your partner's checkpoint, kupo.${prompt}
  12035: But be careful not to relax too much! Just sitting there staring at the clouds won't help you at all, kupo. You have to concentrate the way you do when healing your wounds!${prompt}
  12036: And keep in mind that you will only learn about your partner's checkpoint.${prompt}
  12037: So help each other out and nothing should go wrong!${prompt}
  12038: Once you reach your checkpoint, you should find something buried there that will prove that you made it! You and your partner should trade your items with each other and then hand them to a moogle, kupo!${prompt}
  12039: That's all there is to it, kupo! You'll get a prize if you succeed, so I hope you do well!${prompt}
  12040: You'll need a partner, so come back when you have one!${prompt}
  12041: Three makes a crowd, kupo! I'm looking for parties of two, and no more!${prompt}
  12042: Do you want to go outside and try the event with the person you're in a party with now?${prompt}
  12043: |-
    Is this partner okay with you?
    ${selection-lines}
    Perfect!
    I want to go with someone else...${prompt}
  12044: Come back when you've decided on a partner, kupo!${prompt}
  12045: |-
    Kupo?
    Where'd your partner go?${prompt}
  12046: I hope you enjoy the event together, kupo! When both of you are ready, just talk to one of us moogles to start!${prompt}
  12047: I'll be waiting here, so just let me know when you're prepared, kupo.${prompt}
  12048: |-
    Kupopo! Congratulations!
    You were wonderful together! This is all yours now, kupo...${prompt}
  12049: Kupo? This isn't your partner's item! Trade with your partner first, and give their item to me!${prompt}
  12050: We're just waiting on your partner now, kupo! Or would you like to cancel your participation?${prompt}
  12051: Your partner isn't ready yet, kupo. I'll wait, though.${prompt}
  12052: It looks like your partner doesn't want to go yet. Just let me know when your partner is ready, kupo.${prompt}
  12053: Are you ready now, kupo?${prompt}
  12054: |-
    Leave town?
    ${selection-lines}
    Send me out!
    Not yet...${prompt}
  12055: Oh, you're both wearing yukata! You must be ready for a real challenge, kupo! Don't worry, though--the prize is worth it!${prompt}
  12056: Kupo? That's not the partner you were with before! Changing partners in the middle of the game is against the rules, kupo.${prompt}
  12057: If you want to play with a different person, you should talk to one of us moogles and start the game over!${prompt}
  12058: I can only give each person one item a day!${prompt}
  12059: Later, I'll check to make sure you both found your checkpoints. I'll also give you this gate glyph so you can return to town, kupo!${prompt}
  12060: 'Kupo? You already have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}...${prompt}'
  12061: Kupo! I almost forgot the most important thing of all! Here, take this!${prompt}
  12062: '${color-alt: 15}The moogle hands ${name-player} a small compass made from scintillant ore.'
  12063: If you both manage to find your checkpoints, I'll give you a reward... So do your best, kupo! ${prompt}
  12064: What? You found a doll, kupo? Then trade it with your partner and give it to one of us moogles!${prompt}
  12065: Sorry, but if you don't reach the checkpoint yourself, I can't give out a reward, kupo...${prompt}
  12066: Looks like you weren't successful... Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...${prompt}
  12067: Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...${prompt}
  12068: '${color-alt: 15}${name-player} returns the compass to the moogle.'
  12069: You know what to do now--get right back on your feet and try again! Just let me know if you're feeling up for it, kupo.${prompt}
  12070: What is it? Do you want to start over?${prompt}
  12071: |-
    Start over?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, please.
    No thanks.${prompt}
  12072: |-
    You there.
    I suppose you've heard the gossip flying around town--the talk of ghosts?${prompt}
  12073: |-
    Have you heard?
    ${selection-lines}
    Ghosts!?
    Yes, I've heard.${prompt}
  12074: Then we may move on to more important matters.${prompt}
  12075: Would you be willing to aid me in exorcising these spirits?${prompt}
  12076: |-
    <Sigh>...
    Allow me to explain.
    I am an exorcist--a banisher of spirits.${prompt}
  12077: I have traveled here at the behest of a certain personage from this nation who is well aware of my skill in such matters.${prompt}
  12078: The request is fairly routine--I am to banish the spirits that have suddenly appeared within the town. But there is a problem...${prompt}
  12079: These ghosts are not simple apparitions.${prompt}
  12080: When they yet lived, they belonged to a witch coven known as the Dark Lilies.${prompt}
  12081: And they use the language of spirits--the Cursed Tongue. It is not a language I am familiar with.${prompt}
  12082: |-
    The art of the exorcist involves learning the mind of the spirit in order to bring it under control.
    I am at the point of capitulation.${prompt}
  12083: That is why I am calling on adventurers to aid me.${prompt}
  12084: I want you to disguise yourself as a monster, and try to eavesdrop on the spirit's mumblings.${prompt}
  12085: Once I learn of these ravings, I will be able to carry out my role as an exorcist.${prompt}
  12086: |-
    Will you help?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    Not a ghost of a chance.${prompt}
  12087: |-
    Ahaha...
    How droll.
    Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt}
  12088: |-
    Most excellent.
    There is one thing you must be aware of, however.${prompt}
  12089: These spirits were once people such as you and I. If they see you directly, there is a good chance they will see through your disguise.${prompt}
  12090: If, by chance, your disguise fails you, simply assume a monstrous form once again and continue your pursuit.${prompt}
  12091: I am aware of two spirits that haunt this town.${prompt}
  12092: The one known as Guwanana is the most alert and suspicious, so I will ask you to first track down the Mithran spirit by the name of Bikho Ronpotteh.${prompt}
  12093: Once you have a clear idea of why the ghost has appeared here, I want you to report your findings to me immediately.${prompt}
  12094: Good luck.${prompt}
  12095: |-
    Is that the glow of success I see upon your face?
    What of the spirit...?${prompt}
  12096: |-
    I see...
    So that is her purpose...${prompt}
  12097: The tale is tragic, but this world is no longer meant for one such as she.${prompt}
  12098: I will prepare for the exorcism.${prompt}
  12099: |-
    You have been a great help.
    Please take this as a token of my appreciation.${prompt}
  12100: |-
    This is a hat modeled after those worn by the Dark Lilies.
    Perhaps you might wear it during the season's festivities.
    Enjoy yourself, and forget about this sorrowful affair.${prompt}
  12101: However, should you wish to aid in another exorcism, I would welcome your help.${prompt}
  12102: |-
    What has befallen you?
    Do you wish to give up?${prompt}
  12103: |-
    Give up?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'm done.
    Not yet.${prompt}
  12104: |-
    A pity.
    Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt}
  12105: Then please return to your pursuit of the spirits.${prompt}
  12106: |-
    Ah, you're back!
    Perhaps you have enough experience now to stalk the more alert ghost of the two.${prompt}
  12107: Will you consent to aid me again?${prompt}
  12108: |-
    The second spirit is called Guwanana.
    She is well aware of her surroundings, so I urge the utmost care when following her.${prompt}
  12109: |-
    Good day!
    I suppose you've heard of all the ghost sightings around town?${prompt}
  12110: I wouldn't expect anything less from an adventurer.${prompt}
  12111: |-
    I'll get straight to the point.
    Do you want to help in an exorcism?${prompt}
  12112: |-
    Well, you adventurers are pretty busy, I guess.
    Let me give you the short version:${prompt}
  12113: I'm a stranger to this land, called in by one of those important types.${prompt}
  12114: |-
    For what?
    I happen to have a certain level of fame as an exorcist.
    You know--a banisher of spirits.${prompt}
  12115: But these spirits are proving to be a bit of a handful.${prompt}
  12116: They were powerful witches in life and used to belong to some famous coven.${prompt}
  12117: |-
    The worst thing is, they use some beastly language known as the “Cursed Tongue.”
    That's not a language I can understand.${prompt}
  12118: |-
    That's a problem because, as an exorcist, I need to learn what's in their hearts and minds.
    Then I can find a weakness.${prompt}
  12119: That's where you come in...${prompt}
  12120: I need you to disguise yourself as a monster and get close enough to find out what they're thinking.${prompt}
  12121: Once I know some details, I can begin the exorcism and rid this town of its unwelcome guests.${prompt}
  12122: |-
    What do you say?
    Will you help?${prompt}
  12123: |-
    Oh...
    Well, ghosts aren't everybody's cup of tea.
    I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt}
  12124: |-
    Thank you!
    There is one thing you should know...${prompt}
  12125: |-
    These ghosts are a little vague, but they were once people too.
    If they get a good look at you, they'll know you're just wearing a costume...${prompt}
  12126: |-
    But don't give up if they catch on to you.
    Just put the disguise back on and try again.${prompt}
  12127: I've located two spirits floating around this town.${prompt}
  12128: |-
    The first one, Pretty Heart, is fairly sharp.
    I suggest you go after Selma, the second spirit, to get your feet wet.${prompt}
  12129: Once you've figured out why the ghost is here, you need to tell me about it right away.${prompt}
  12130: Good luck!${prompt}
  12131: Oho, looks like you've managed to learn something...${prompt}
  12132: |-
    Hmmm...
    So that's why...${prompt}
  12133: |-
    It might seem cruel, but that ghost no longer belongs here.
    The exorcism is for their sake as much as ours...${prompt}
  12134: It's time to begin my preparation.${prompt}
  12135: Oh, and this is for you.${prompt}
  12136: |-
    It's a witch hat.
    The design matches those worn by the coven I mentioned.
    Put it on, and go have fun. Forget about ghosts for a while.${prompt}
  12137: If you want to try your hand at ghost-chasing again, I'll be right here.${prompt}
  12138: Giving up the ghost?${prompt}
  12139: |-
    Oh...
    Well, ghosts aren't everybody's cup of tea.
    I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt}
  12140: Then it's back to chasing spirits with you!${prompt}
  12141: |-
    You know what?
    I think you could probably track that other ghost now that you have some experience.${prompt}
  12142: What do you think?${prompt}
  12143: |-
    Your target's name is Pretty Heart.
    Wonder why he's called that...${prompt}
  12144: |-
    Really?
    I'm pretty sure you've got it in you...${prompt}
  12145: |-
    Hi, I'm Gertrude.
    I came to investigate the rumors of ghosts haunting this town.
    Have you heard anything?${prompt}
  12146: |-
    You have?
    Well, that makes my job easier, then.${prompt}
  12147: Do you think you could help out a struggling exorcist?${prompt}
  12148: |-
    No?
    Then let me fill you in on the details.${prompt}
  12149: I may not appear as such, but I'm actually an exorcist from a land far to the west.${prompt}
  12150: A certain personage from this nation summoned me to banish the spirits plaguing the city.${prompt}
  12151: But once I arrived, I discovered these ghosts were not your average apparitions.${prompt}
  12152: In life, they were fearsome witches and wielded destructive spells of tremendous power.${prompt}
  12153: Their strength has followed them into the afterlife, giving them a high level of resistance to my exorcisms.${prompt}
  12154: In this sort of case, I would usually find some clue from their former lives in order to empower my rituals.${prompt}
  12155: The problem is, these spirits speak the Cursed Tongue, and I can't understand enough of that language to learn anything.${prompt}
  12156: And so, I'm forced to call upon adventurers to aid me.${prompt}
  12157: Would you be willing to disguise yourself as a monster and try to discover what drives these beings?${prompt}
  12158: |-
    Adventurers are often very busy, or so I've heard.
    Please come back if you change your mind.${prompt}
  12159: |-
    Wonderful.
    There is one thing I must warn you of, however.${prompt}
  12160: These witches were once people, and are clever enough to see through your disguise should you be too careless.${prompt}
  12161: |-
    If they do happen to find you out, please don't give up.
    They will soon forget, and you can don your costume once again.${prompt}
  12162: According to my sources, there are two ghosts in this area.${prompt}
  12163: |-
    The one called Maryse is extremely vigilant and aware of her surroundings.
    I suggest you try following Poseaulloie first to get some practice.${prompt}
  12164: |-
    Once you've discovered the ghost's reason for remaining in this world, please inform me at once.
    There are many preparations to be made.${prompt}
  12165: Good luck!${prompt}
  12166: How did you fare...?${prompt}
  12167: I see, so that's why she...${prompt}
  12168: However, it is my duty to give her that little push she needs to leave this world behind.${prompt}
  12169: I will begin preparing for the exorcism.${prompt}
  12170: |-
    Your help has been invaluable.
    Would you accept this in appreciation?${prompt}
  12171: |-
    It's a witch hat.
    Please wear it in the festivities and forget about ghosts and spirits for a while...${prompt}
  12172: If you have time, I would gladly accept your help again.${prompt}
  12173: |-
    What's wrong?
    Have you grown tired of your task?${prompt}
  12174: |-
    Oh, I see...
    Well, please return to me if you find your patience for this task restored.${prompt}
  12175: |-
    Then I would ask you to return to your task.
    Good luck.${prompt}
  12176: Would you consider an attempt at following the more wily of the two spirits?${prompt}
  12177: I'm sure you have sufficient experience now.${prompt}
  12178: |-
    Then your next target is the one known as Maryse.
    Please be careful...${prompt}
  12179: |-
    You must recover your strength before you continue pursuing these supernatural intruders.
    Return to me once you have had time to rest.${prompt}
  12180: |-
    I appreciate the offer of help, but you're in no state to be chasing ghosts.
    Build your strength, rest your mind, and return to me when you're ready.${prompt}
  12181: I'm happy to have someone so cooperative on my side, but too much contact with spirits will drain your strength. Return to me on the morrow when you've had time to rest.${prompt}

    Trick or treat?
    I've seen the most sensationally scary costumes around town, kupo!${prompt}

    What a wonderful witch hat, kupo!
    Since you've shown me your costume, I'll bring out some of my special merchandise, kupo!${prompt}
  12255: |-
    Kupopopo～!
    This is terrible!
    Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!${prompt}
  12256: As you probably already know, the villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt}
  12257: |-
    But never fear!
    Our top moogle researchers have created weapons that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans--the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]} and the marvelous ${item-singular: 1[2]}, kupo!${prompt}
  12258: The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt}
  12259: But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!${prompt}
  12260: |-
    And that's not all!
    This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!${prompt}
  12261: You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!${prompt}
  12262: 'That''s why we want you to plant (${color: 5}trade${color: 1}) your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or ${item-singular: 1[2]} into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment''s regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!${prompt}'
  12263: 'Just remember that the further away you travel from the ward, the weaker it becomes. We recommend staying in the same ${color: 5}area${color: 1} for best results.${prompt}'
  12264: 'Alright. Here''s your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Now you''re ready to do battle, kupo!${prompt}'
  12265: Oh, and you'll find that the prizes we have for you this time are even better than the last ones. You might even be one of the lucky adventurers who wins a spiffy, new... Ah, you'll just have to see it to believe it, kupo!${prompt}
  12266: 'Now, if you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!${prompt}'
  12267: Vana'diel is under attack by villains in our stolen samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!${prompt}
  12268: We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo! Equip, I tell you! Equiiiiiip!${prompt}
  12269: |-
    Th-that ${item-singular: 0[2]}...
    It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!${prompt}
  12270: 'Oh, just don''t forget to place the ward with your ${item-singular: 0[2]} when you''ve defeated one!${prompt}'
  12271: 'You''ll be able to really hurt those harbingers of harm with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Now hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!${prompt}'
  12272: 'Oh, just don''t forget to place the ward with your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or your ${item-singular: 1[2]} when you''ve defeated one!${prompt}'
  12273: And whatever you do, don't wander too far from the area; your weary wards will weaken, kupo!${prompt}
  12274: 'No, no, no! That ${item-singular: 1[2]} is way too sharp! Just think of the damage it will deal to the poor armor! Now go get yourself ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and hurry back, kupo!${prompt}'
  12275: |-
    Well done!
    On to the next one, kupo!${prompt}
  12276: That thief has already been weakened by a ward. Try to find one that hasn't, kupo!${prompt}
  12277: |-
    Wonderful! Here's your reward, kupo!
    If you're still up for it, why don't you go out and whack yourself some more?${prompt}
  12278: Unbelievable! Now, maybe those Far Eastern traders won't mix us up into moogle mincemeat! Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt}
  12279: I-I'm speechless! We didn't think anyone could match wits with that Mithra menace! Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt}
  12280: The shadow of the thief still lingers within the armor...${prompt}
  12281: The thief's shadow has almost disappeared completely.${prompt}
  12282: '${color-alt: 15}${name-player}''s badge flashes brightly.${prompt}'
  12283: Beyond the Gugru Blue lies an enormous continent, or so they say.${prompt}
  12284: |-
    I wonder what kind of monsters you can find there...
    Of course, beginners shouldn't venture far outside of town, no matter what nation they're in!${prompt}
  12285: Don'taru you think the world's become all so rowdy-dowdy lately? The Manustery's remodeling the Cardians like there's no tomorrow!${prompt}
  12286: |-
    There could plausibly, possibly be a war soon!
    Could it entail...an expedient expedition to the Near East? No way, right!?${prompt}
  12287: That should be none of your concern.${prompt}
  12288: So long as the Star Sibyl blesses us with her presence, the peace of Windurst is a given.${prompt}
  12289: Among the guards of Windurst are the automatons who speaky-weaky in the words of the stars.${prompt}
  12290: I heardy-weardy that there are automatons in Aht Urhgan too, but they can't do what ours can! Talk about boring-woring!${prompt}
  12291: |-
    Munch-munch...chew-chew...
    What's that? Something about “Aht Urhgan”?
    I heard that the beastmen there are crazy-wazy! Rumor has it that they even attack the towns sometimes!${prompt}
  12292: |-
    If I could just go there on a business trip, I'd have enough scoops to last the rest of my life!
    Then again, if the rumors are true, that might not be very long!${prompt}
  12293: |-
    Hm. I infer somebody wants to know-know about Aht Urhgan, perhaps?
    Then you should look up at this night's night sky.${prompt}
  12294: Compared to the night sky, this world is small. Perhaps it holds that that you seek.${prompt}
  12295: Eh? Whaddaya want with me, pal?${prompt}
  12296: |-
    Show her Leleroon's letter?
    ${selection-lines}

  12679: “Strength” is a term used to describe the chocobo's leg power. The more strength a chocobo has, the faster it will be able to run. Rental chocobos have been raised with an emphasis on this attribute.${prompt}
  12680: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  12681: “Endurance” is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.${prompt}
  12682: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  12683: “Discernment” is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.${prompt}
  12684: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  12685: “Receptivity” is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.${prompt}
  12686: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  12687: “Energy” is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.${prompt}
  12688: You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!${prompt}
  12689: “Affection” is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!${prompt}
  12690: You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.${prompt}
  12691: 'If you really want to raise your chocobo''s affection quickly, you can give it ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, but I can''t recommend doing so unless absolutely necessary.${prompt}'

  12695: A care schedule is a series of plans that you set up for your chocobo so that we can take care of it while you are away.${prompt}
  12696: How you want us to care for your chocobo each day is completely up to you.${prompt}
  12697: You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).${prompt}
  12698: When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.${prompt}
  12699: With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.${prompt}
  12700: The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.${prompt}
  12701: You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.${prompt}
  12702: The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.${prompt}
  12703: However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.${prompt}
  12704: We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.${prompt}
  12705: Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.${prompt}
  12706: Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.${prompt}
  12707: If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  12708: Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.${prompt}
  12709: If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  12710: Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.${prompt}
  12711: However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.${prompt}
  12712: If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  12713: Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.${prompt}
  12714: But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.${prompt}
  12715: If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}

    Taking a walk.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  12728: In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  12729: Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.${prompt}
  12730: On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.${prompt}
  12731: However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.${prompt}
  12732: You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  12733: Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.${prompt}
  12734: You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.${prompt}
  12735: I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)${prompt}
  12736: Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.${prompt}
  12737: This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.${prompt}
  12738: Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.${prompt}
  12739: You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.${prompt}
  12740: I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.${prompt}
  12741: Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!${prompt}

    What would you like to know about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Why feeding is important.
    Vegetables.
    Wildgrasses.
    Carrots.
    Worms.
    Medicines.
    Pastes.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  12743: Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.${prompt}
  12744: However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.${prompt}
  12745: The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.${prompt}
  12746: At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!${prompt}
  12747: Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.${prompt}
  12748: There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!${prompt}
  12749: 'Just ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.${prompt}'
  12750: 'This is the standard variety of chocobo feed, among which ${item-plural: 0[2]} are most popular.${prompt}'
  12751: 'Chocobos also seem to enjoy ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  12752: These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.${prompt}
  12753: Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.${prompt}
  12754: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, the effects are different.${prompt}'
  12755: 'In addition, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is effective for illness, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for a stomachache. It''s a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.${prompt}'
  12756: Carrots are high in nutrition, and will have an effect on the chocobo's strength and discernment.${prompt}
  12757: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}, for example, affect the chocobo''s physical attributes, and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are good for its mental attributes. ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 2[2]} are in a category of their own.${prompt}'
  12758: Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  12759: Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!${prompt}
  12760: 'For example, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will dramatically increase your chocobo''s affection, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will restore its energy.${prompt}'
  12761: But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...${prompt}
  12762: 'The most curious of all the worms is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...${prompt}'
  12763: Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  12764: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will restore your chocobo''s energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.${prompt}'
  12765: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.${prompt}'
  12766: A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.${prompt}
  12767: Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.${prompt}
  12768: You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.${prompt}
  12769: Chicks can also eat regular feed, though.${prompt}

    Which would you like to ask about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Abilities.
    Temperament.
    Weather preferences.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  12771: Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.${prompt}
  12772: For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.${prompt}
  12773: Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.${prompt}
  12774: But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.${prompt}
  12775: The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.${prompt}
  12776: Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.${prompt}
  12777: Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.${prompt}
  12778: Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.${prompt}
  12779: You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.${prompt}
  12780: After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.${prompt}
  12781: 'When your chocobo retires, you will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Be sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  12782: 'You can use the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  12783: The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!${prompt}
  12784: When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.${prompt}
  12785: 'You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}'
  12786: 'You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  12787: I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.${prompt}
  12788: 'When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  12789: You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  12790: That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.${prompt}

  12798: 'You can use ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to call your chocobo in the field to use as a mount.${prompt}'

  13925: |-
    Why not!?
    Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.${prompt}
  13926: We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A “win-win situation,” as we like to call it in the business.${prompt}
  13927: However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...${prompt}
  13928: The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.${prompt}
  13929: And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.${prompt}
  13930: Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!${prompt}
  13931: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  13932: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  13933: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  13934: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  13935: Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.${prompt}
  13936: Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.${prompt}
  13937: In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.${prompt}
  13938: Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.${prompt}
  13939: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  13940: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  13941: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  13942: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  13943: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  13944: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  13945: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}

  14218: The promenade itself is split into eastern and western halves, both of which house all of the same facilities. Be sure to stop by and have a look when you get a chance.${prompt}
  14219: 'Attendants at the chocobet centers are there to assist you with acquiring ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, as well as collecting your winnings.${prompt}'
  14220: There are a total of five centers readily available for your convenience, each of which are located near the transportation portals. There are two to the east and west of here, and one just to the north.${prompt}
  14221: All chocobet centers are capable of providing the same services.${prompt}
  14222: The grandstand faces the racetrack itself, and allows spectators to sit and enjoy the races in comfort.${prompt}
  14223: To get there, just follow the red carpet all the way through the betting area. You can't miss it.${prompt}

  14227: This racetrack is equipped with portals to transport our patrons to any of the three nations, as well as Jeuno and Al Zahbi.${prompt}
  14228: As you can see, we are regularly visited by a multitude of race fans, breeders, and jockeys from every realm imaginable. We have therefore relegated each portal to a single destination in an attempt to avoid congestion.${prompt}

    Race Progression.
    That's about it.${prompt}
  14234: A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.${prompt}
  14235: Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.${prompt}
  14236: In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.${prompt}
  14237: For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.${prompt}
  14238: The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.${prompt}
  14239: What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.${prompt}
  14240: Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  14241: Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.${prompt}
  14242: The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.${prompt}
  14243: The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.${prompt}
  14244: The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.${prompt}
  14245: In such an event, the “less endowed” of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.${prompt}
  14246: Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.${prompt}
  14247: Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the “race grade.”${prompt}
  14248: For example, a “C4 Chocobo Race” would indicate a typical grade 4 race.${prompt}
  14249: We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.${prompt}
  14250: No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.${prompt}
  14251: Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.${prompt}
  14252: As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.${prompt}
  14253: Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  14254: Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.${prompt}
  14255: Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.${prompt}
  14256: The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.${prompt}
  14257: As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.${prompt}
  14258: Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  14259: We have a total of four races that run in succession.${prompt}
  14260: Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.${prompt}
  14261: Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.${prompt}
  14262: Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!${prompt}

    Signing up for another race.
    I'm fine, thanks.${prompt}
  14264: There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.${prompt}
  14265: First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.${prompt}
  14266: Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a “race chocobo,” for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.${prompt}
  14267: Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...${prompt}
  14268: All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.${prompt}
  14269: A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.${prompt}
  14270: Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.${prompt}
  14271: There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.${prompt}
  14272: There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.${prompt}
  14273: 'Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.${prompt}'
  14274: 'In the event that you should lose or misplace your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.${prompt}'
  14275: The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!${prompt}
  14276: You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.${prompt}
  14277: 'To collect, simply hand in the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you received during race signup at any signup center.${prompt}'
  14278: The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.${prompt}
  14279: You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.${prompt}
  14280: After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).${prompt}
  14281: This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.${prompt}
  14282: We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.${prompt}

    What would you like to ask?
    ${selection-lines}
    What is chocobetting?
    How do I bet?
    What are odds?
    When do I bet?
    How do I collect winnings?
    Nothing.${prompt}
  14284: Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.${prompt}
  14285: To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.${prompt}
  14286: Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.${prompt}
  14287: For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.${prompt}
  14288: And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.${prompt}
  14289: Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.${prompt}
  14290: The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!${prompt}
  14291: 'To place a chocobet, you must obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the chocobet center. ${prompt}'
  14292: 'For any single ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.${prompt}'
  14293: We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.${prompt}
  14294: Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.${prompt}
  14295: Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.${prompt}
  14296: It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.${prompt}
  14297: What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.${prompt}
  14298: 'Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.${prompt}'
  14299: The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.${prompt}
  14300: Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.${prompt}
  14301: Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.${prompt}
  14302: Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.${prompt}
  14303: 'Once the race is finished, you can exchange your ${item-singular: 0[2]} at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.${prompt}'
  14304: 'Without ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  14305: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.${prompt}'
  14306: Should one week pass, we will be unable to accept the ticket, so it is always best to cash out as soon as possible.${prompt}

    Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele.
    What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?${prompt}
  14374: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  14375: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  14376: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  14377: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  14378: Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!${prompt}
  14379: |-
    The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal.
    It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.${prompt}
  14380: |-
    Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern.
    If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.${prompt}
  14381: |-
    Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area.
    Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.${prompt}
  14382: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  14383: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  14384: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  14385: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  14386: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  14387: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  14388: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  14389: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  14390: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo''s performance.${prompt}'
  14391: |-
    You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers.
    Thank you for your understanding.${prompt}
  14392: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  14393: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  14394: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  14395: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  14396: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  14397: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
  14398: Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.${prompt}
  14399: |-
    We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence.
    The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.${prompt}
  14400: |-
    Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits.
    And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.${prompt}
  14401: |-
    As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind.
    It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack.
    Consider yourself warned.${prompt}
  14402: |-
    In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well.
    Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part.
    It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!${prompt}
  14403: |-
    Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed.
    These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.${prompt}
  14404: |-

  14472: ピヨピヨ！${prompt}
  14473: She says, “When the ace makes chase, there's not a bird in Vana'diel who can keep pace.”${prompt}
  14474: She says, “And you can bet the chocobo farm that this year it'll be 'four-time' all☆star!“${prompt}
  14475: She says, “This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean.”${prompt}
  14476: She says, “There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed.”${prompt}
  14477: She says, “This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say.”${prompt}
  14478: She says, “Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn.”${prompt}
  14479: She says, “This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race.”${prompt}
  14480: She says, ”This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'”${prompt}
  14481: 'Next we have ${choice: 0}[Pure Beauty/Ambitious Impact/Young Typhoon], being ridden by ${choice: 0}[the chocogirl next door, Hazina/dark chocostalker, Pikanza/self-proclaimed chocogeek, Qunbubu].${prompt}'

  14491: She says that simply smelling like a chocobo doesn't make one a chocobo.${prompt}

  14493: She says that this Tarutaru has been practicing the choquestrian arts since he was only two years old.${prompt}
  14494: And that's our lineup. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a feeling that today's match up will go down in the annals of racing history.${prompt}
  14495: And here's today's lineup. What excitement lies in store for all our faithful chocofans listening on the CRA linkshell channel?${prompt}
  14496: The contestants have arrived at the starting line, and the race will begin shortly.${prompt}
  14497: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to another round of awe-inspiring head-to-head chocobo racing! I am Goccilo, your master of ceremonies.

  14506: Well, let's get right down to it! The race is about to begin!
  14507: I must admit, I was a tad vexed about who our bird might be facing today, but I realize now that my petty presentiments were quite unfounded.${prompt}
  14508: Yeah! What he said! You're lucky we're even letting you share the same track as Best!${prompt}
  14509: |-
    Yeah...
    Good luck, ${name-player}...${prompt}
  14510: Today's match is a head-to-head battle, with the winner taking all! Let's start off by introducing our two competitors.${prompt}
  14511: 'And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, ${choice: 0}[Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].${prompt}'
  14512: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'”${prompt}
  14513: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.”${prompt}
  14514: Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.${prompt}
  14515: They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.${prompt}
  14516: Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], Wahboud!${prompt}
  14517: Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!${prompt}
  14518: As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.${prompt}
  14519: ${name-player}. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.${prompt}
  14520: Good luck, ${name-player}. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!${prompt}
  14521: Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!${prompt}
  14522: 'And next we have ${choice: 0}[Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by ${choice: 0}[VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].${prompt}'
  14523: ピヨッ！${prompt}
  14524: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.”${prompt}
  14525: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.”${prompt}
  14526: Sakura says, “Big things often come in small packages.”${prompt}
  14527: Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--${prompt}
  14528: a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!${prompt}
  14529: This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.${prompt}
  14530: Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!${prompt}
  14531: It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted “piece de resistance”?${prompt}
  14532: We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.${prompt}
  14533: Well, there you have it.${prompt}

  14536: '...the most prestigious chocobo race in all of southern Quon--the Gustaberg Derby!${prompt}'
  14537: Joining me today is Metalworks mastermind, Cid.${prompt}
  14538: Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?${prompt}
  14539: Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  14540: Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--${prompt}
  14541: The Rakapopo Cup!${prompt}
  14542: Today's guest is Heavens Tower's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Ku～pipi～!${prompt}
  14543: So～,♪ I've lea～rned that yo～u have entered♪ your ve～ry own pe～rsona～l♪ cho～cobo in the cu～p.♪ Wha～t do yo～u think her♪ cha～nces are of ta～king♪ ho～me the gra～nd pri～ze?♪${prompt}
  14544: Are yo～u making fun of me, si～r!? We～ll, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my～ gutty-wutty when my Starlight sai～ls across the finish line yea～rs before the nearest competitaru!♪${prompt}
  14545: Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.${prompt}
  14546: My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!${prompt}
  14547: '${choice: 0}[Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing all★star/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Ne～ver heard of ${choice: 0}[him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!${prompt}'
  14548: We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one “Kamp Kweh.” We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.${prompt}
  14549: Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...${prompt}
  14550: Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take mo～re than an embiggened brainy-wa～iny to beat Starlight!♪${prompt}
  14551: What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.${prompt}
  14552: Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...${prompt}
  14553: Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fa～n! I won't let Starlight lo～se to some impo～ster!${prompt}
  14554: Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called “reincarnate's” redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!${prompt}
  14555: Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?${prompt}
  14556: Hah! Well, I～ have been riding cho～cobos for twenty-one years!${prompt}
  14557: 'And next is ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by ${choice: 1}[San d''Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d''Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!${prompt}'
  14558: Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.${prompt}
  14559: Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...${prompt}
  14560: Both Starlight a～nd the professor hate to take orders... Maybe tha～t's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!♪${prompt}
  14561: The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.${prompt}
  14562: When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.${prompt}
  14563: When the profe～ssor's not stumbling over his spee～ch impediment-ethy, he's re～searching the intricacies of chocobo beha～vioral patterns.${prompt}
  14564: And they're off!
  14565: Markovich, what did you think of the start?
  14566: Well, I fel--
  14567: ピヨピヨッ！
  14568: Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.
  14569: Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  14570: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  14571: And as they pass the halfway mark...
  14572: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} holds on to the lead!'
  14573: '${number: 0} different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!'
  14574: 'While from behind the pack, #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  14575: 'While from behind, #${number: 2} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  14576: 'All ${number: 0} chocobos battle for the lead!'
  14577: Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!
  14578: And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!
  14579: ピヨピヨ！
  14580: Sakura says, “The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.”
  14581: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  14582: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  14583: 'Incredible! ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed is approaching dangerous limits!'
  14584: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!'
  14585: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  14586: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed has begun to drop off!'
  14587: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has begun to tire!'
  14588: The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  14589: The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  14590: The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!
  14591: The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!
  14592: 'The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  14593: 'Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  14594: 'And yet ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems completely unaffected by the attack!'
  14595: And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  14596: And now they're approaching the final corner!
  14597: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  14598: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  14599: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  14600: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead!'
  14601: The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  14602: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  14603: 'And ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} takes the crown!'
  14604: 'What''s this? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  14605: 'And it''s ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} by a beak!!!'
  14606: Let's take a look at the results...${prompt}
  14607: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})${prompt}'
  14608: There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!${prompt}
  14609: Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.${prompt}
  14610: Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.${prompt}
  14611: Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.${prompt}
  14612: |-
    What an amazing race!
    The other chocobos were no match for ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?${prompt}
  14613: 'What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird''s performance?${prompt}'
  14614: '${choice: 0}[Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!${prompt}'
  14615: The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.${prompt}
  14616: Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!${prompt}
  14617: Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...${prompt}
  14618: Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exa～ctly as I expected!♪${prompt}
  14619: The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no wa～y Starlight could lose! Her horoscope sai～d so!${prompt}
  14620: |-
    And there you have it.
    This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!${prompt}
  14621: And now, let's see the results from the last race.
  14622: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})'
  14623: And that's all she wrote, folks!
  14624: 'The winnings for a ${number: 0}-${number: 1} bet come to ${number: 2} gil per quill!'
  14625: Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?
  14626: She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!
  14627: She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.
  14628: Until next time, race fans...
  14629: Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.${prompt}
  14630: 'Taking the crown for today''s race was none other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  14631: 'To the winning steed''s owner we present the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Rocochookie,” I mean, “Chocorookie”!${prompt}'
  14632: 'And to the ambitious and sporting ${name-player}, we present this undeniably useful ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  14633: Good show, ${name-player}. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.${prompt}
  14634: |-
    Excellent race, ${name-player}!
    You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.${prompt}
  14635: Okay, ma～ybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I sti～ll think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!${prompt}
  14636: Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.${prompt}
  14637: But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.${prompt}

  14651: With me today is a man who needs absolutely no introduction, Markovich, and our favorite...${prompt}
  14652: |-
    Oh...?
    Isn't the adorable Sakura with us today?${prompt}
  14653: I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.${prompt}
  14654: |-
    Is that so...?
    Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...${prompt}
  14655: |-
    Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone.
    You of all people should know that the show must go on!${prompt}
  14656: Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own “baby” will be taking the field!${prompt}
  14657: Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!${prompt}
  14658: |-
    But of course! I had forgotten all about it!
    Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you!
    Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!${prompt}
  14659: |-
    But that's not where it ends!
    There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?${prompt}
  14660: |-
    A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself.
    Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?${prompt}
  14661: It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.${prompt}
  14662: |-
    Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state!
    But...${prompt}
  14663: But...?${prompt}
  14664: I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.${prompt}
  14665: |-
    I see...
    Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?${prompt}
  14666: |-
    You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo.
    Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?${prompt}
  14667: |-
    But enough talking, I say.
    It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!${prompt}
  14668: |-
    Oh, yes, right...
    Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay!
    It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!${prompt}
  14669: 'In the chocobo corner, we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.${prompt}'
  14670: |-
    Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo?
    I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.${prompt}
  14671: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don''t let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, “a wolf in sheep''s clothing”!${prompt}'
  14672: I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!${prompt}
  14673: I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?${prompt}
  14674: Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that “monsters” like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.${prompt}
  14675: Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!${prompt}
  14676: With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!${prompt}
  14677: |-
    Whoopee!
    Bring them on, I say!${prompt}
  14678: |-
    Erm...yes...
    Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.${prompt}
  14679: Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.${prompt}
  14680: |-
    Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki!
    Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.${prompt}
  14681: |-
    Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo.
    I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.${prompt}
  14682: And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!${prompt}
  14683: |-
    My, oh my...!
    I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--${prompt}
  14684: |-
    A-ahem!
    I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.${prompt}
  14685: |-
    All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies!
    Well done, my pretty! Well done!${prompt}
  14686: |-
    It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders...
    <Sniffle>${prompt}
  14687: |-
    Next in the lineup is Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    ...!? What on Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  14688: |-
    Hrmmm...
    Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.${prompt}
  14689: Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...${prompt}
  14690: |-
    What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man!
    There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!${prompt}
  14691: Um, yes... Please forgive me...${prompt}
  14692: |-
    And won't you look at the lineup!
    This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks?
    I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?${prompt}
  14693: And with me today is our regular guest commentator...${prompt}
  14694: |-
    Huh?
    Why isn't Markovich here?${prompt}
  14695: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.${prompt}
  14696: |-
    <Gulp>
    You...you're that mage from Windurst...${prompt}
  14697: '...Professor Shantotto!${prompt}'
  14698: |-
    If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich,
    as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.${prompt}
  14699: |-
    Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence,
    four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.${prompt}
  14700: |-
    So if you care to hear out my little proposal,
    these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.${prompt}
  14701: |-
    With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice...
    Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?${prompt}
  14702: |-
    With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused?
    Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.${prompt}
  14703: First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.${prompt}
  14704: |-
    Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold.
    I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.${prompt}
  14705: Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.${prompt}
  14706: |-
    Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word “failure.”
    Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.${prompt}
  14707: Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.${prompt}
  14708: |-
    Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable.
    If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.${prompt}
  14709: Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!${prompt}
  14710: |-
    For Ace of Trophies, “championship contender” is an unfitting description.
    Even “consecutive champion” would not be too high an expectation.${prompt}
  14711: |-
    Um...Professor Shantotto...
    Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?${prompt}
  14712: |-
    Ohohohohoho!
    Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so.
    But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!${prompt}
  14713: |-
    Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage.
    Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.${prompt}
  14714: |-
    Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview.
    So let the race begin, without further ado!${prompt}
  14715: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    Of this inevitable result, I was always assured--
    that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!${prompt}
  14716: |-
    The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor.
    But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.${prompt}
  14717: |-
    H-hey!
    What do you think you're trying to pull here!?${prompt}
  14718: |-
    My, my, what a pleasant surprise!
    I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.${prompt}
  14719: |-
    How dare you “ohoho” your way into my hard-earned commentary seat!
    This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!${prompt}
  14720: |-
    Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification.
    I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.${prompt}
  14721: |-
    And you, Goccilo!
    What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!${prompt}
  14722: |-
    Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing!
    Until next time...!${prompt}
  14723: ${name-player}, I knew you'd make it all the way here.${prompt}
  14724: |-
    What's with the baffled expression?
    It's me, Sakura.${prompt}
  14725: |-
    You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird.
    I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.${prompt}
  14726: I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.${prompt}
  14727: I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...${prompt}
  14728: And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.${prompt}
  14729: I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.${prompt}
  14730: Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.${prompt}
  14731: I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  14732: I hope that'll be your chocobo, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  14733: |-
    And next, we have Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    But something seems to be different...
    Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.${prompt}
  14734: She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!${prompt}
  14735: The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.${prompt}
  14736: |-
    I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround!
    A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.${prompt}
  14737: And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.${prompt}
  14738: It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.${prompt}
  14739: |-
    And that completes the lineup, folks.
    With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!${prompt}
  14740: 'You find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  14741: Welcome to the Dream Race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  14742: I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.${prompt}
  14743: I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.${prompt}
  14744: I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.${prompt}
  14745: |-
    But no more...
    If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.${prompt}
  14746: This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.${prompt}
  14747: I won't hold back in today's race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  14748: Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.${prompt}
  14749: Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  14750: I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?${prompt}
  14751: Next, we have Sakura...${prompt}
  14752: |-
    Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?
    This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!${prompt}
  14753: |-
    Well I'll be...
    In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!${prompt}
  14754: '...${prompt}'
  14755: |-
    Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks.
    For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?${prompt}
  14756: '${name-player}, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Chocochampion”!${prompt}'
  14757: |-
    Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far!
    Congratulations!${prompt}
  14758: |-
    Great race, ${name-player}.
    It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.${prompt}
  14759: |-
    But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come..
    With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...${prompt}
  14760: |-
    Princess...
    Princess Sakura!${prompt}
  14761: |-
    Princess...?
    What are you talking about? Who are you?${prompt}
  14762: |-
    Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion.
    I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.${prompt}
  14763: Searching for...me?${prompt}
  14764: |-
    Yes, Your Highness.
    You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.${prompt}
  14765: |-
    Are you serious!?
    Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?${prompt}
  14766: |-
    That is correct.
    Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.${prompt}
  14767: D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?${prompt}
  14768: |-
    ...!
    I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...${prompt}
  14769: Wh...what happened?${prompt}
  14770: |-
    You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world.
    You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...${prompt}
  14771: She...she gave up her life to save me?${prompt}
  14772: |-
    Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again.
    But, I never once gave up hope...${prompt}
  14773: My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.${prompt}
  14774: So that's what happened...${prompt}
  14775: Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos! ${prompt}
  14776: '...${prompt}'
  14777: I'm sorry, but I can't go.${prompt}
  14778: |-
    Your Highness!
    But...why!?${prompt}
  14779: Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like ${name-player}'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.${prompt}
  14780: What's more...${prompt}
  14781: I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...${prompt}
  14782: I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.${prompt}
  14783: What...?${prompt}
  14784: The only place I belong is here, beside you.${prompt}
  14785: |-
    And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer?
    I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?${prompt}
  14786: I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!${prompt}
  14787: |-
    Heehee!
    Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!${prompt}
  14788: |-
    ${name-player}, I'm looking forward to our rematch!
    Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?${prompt}
  14789: You're still here, eh, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  14790: Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?${prompt}
  14791: |-
    What?
    How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?${prompt}
  14792: |-
    Hohoho...
    It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.${prompt}
  14793: I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...${prompt}
  14794: |-
    Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos?
    No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.${prompt}
  14795: Sakura is the queen, you say?${prompt}
  14796: |-
    <Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises.
    But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.${prompt}
  14797: |-
    You know what they say: Home is where the heart is.
    To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.${prompt}
  14798: |-
    And you, our new Chocochampion!
    Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.${prompt}
  14799: |-
    Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today.
    These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.${prompt}
  14800: And they're off!
  14801: |-
    Hrmmm!
    ${choice: 0}[Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!
  14802: Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?
  14803: |-
    All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance.
    But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.
  14804: Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  14805: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  14806: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  14807: The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  14808: The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!
  14809: And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  14810: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  14811: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead!'
  14812: The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  14813: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has used ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!'
  14814: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  14815: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  14816: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  14817: 'What''s this? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  14818: '${number: 1}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}${prompt}'
  14819: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s using ${choice: 1}[Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!'
  14820: 'Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those ${choice: 0}[monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!'
  14821: |-
    ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed!
    And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!
  14822: "I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s step. \nAnd the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!"
  14823: |-
    And here's some unexpected drama, folks!
    The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?
  14824: 'Look at that! ${lettercase: 1}${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!'
  14825: |-
    Uh-oh, what's going on here!?
    The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!
  14826: 'Oooh! In a bold move, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has just used a ${choice: 0}[Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!'
  14827: |-
    What's this!?
    All of the chocobos other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!
  14828: |-
    Thanks to that brazen little act, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks!
    That just might seal the deal for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!
  14829: |-
    Never in all my days, race fans!
    In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!
  14830: |-
    How could my creation make such a rookie mistake?
    In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!
  14831: Shantotto starts casting Tornado!
  14832: The speed of the chocobos has dropped!
  14833: The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!
  14834: The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!
  14835: |-
    Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!?
    What in the world do you think you're doing!?
  14836: |-
    Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame.
    This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.
  14837: |-
    What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today?
    I've heard it being said that today's ${choice: 0}[creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal.
    This could get heavy, folks!
  14838: |-
    All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them.
    Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?
  14839: It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!
  14840: |-
    There's still plenty of race to go, race fans!
    More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!
  14841: And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!
  14842: |-
    The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now.
    This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!
  14843: |-
    This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent.
    Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!
  14844: |-
    And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty!
    Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!
  14845: |-
    And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them!
    But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?
  14846: |-
    I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call!
    Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?
  14847: |-
    It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now!
    The time for a final spurt is now or never!
  14848: And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?
  14849: |-
    You see a single, ivory ${color: 5}venture roll${color: 1} die on the table.
    There are currently ${number: 0}/${number: 1} other players wishing to participate.${prompt}
  14850: |-
    What would you like to do?
    ${selection-lines}
    Join table (${number: 2} gil).
    Leave.
    Read manual.${prompt}
  14851: 'There are currently ${number: 0}/${number: 8} players at the table. Please wait a moment until the remaining participants have arrived. (You may still leave the table at any time.)'
  14852: 'You place ${number: 6} gil in the pot.${prompt}'

    Double up? (Currently: ${number: 0})
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  14856: |-
    ${name-player} doubles up...
    Your ${color: 5}venture roll${color: 1} total is now ${number: 0}!
  14857: |-
    ${name-player} doubles up...
    BUST!!!
  14858: '${entity: 0} holds fast.'
  14859: Double up complete.${prompt}

  14863: The game has ended in a draw!${prompt}
  14864: 'The winner is ${entity: 0}!${prompt}'
  14865: Someone has dropped the die down the drain! You can no longer continue playing.${prompt}
  14866: The final place at the table has already been taken.${prompt}
  14867: You do not have enough gil.${prompt}
  14868: Someone has dropped the die!${prompt}
  14869: |-
    Read which chapter?
    ${selection-lines}
    1. “The Heart of Venture Roll.”
    2. “Rules of the Roll.”
    3. “Putting the Book Down.”${prompt}
  14870: Venture roll is a competitive game played with dice similar to those used by corsairs. The objective is to roll until your cumulative total comes as close to 11 as possible without going over.${prompt}
  14871: 'Until you reach or go over 11, you may continue rolling (${color: 5}doubling up${color: 1}) as many times as the table time limit allows (${number: 8} ${choice-plurality: 8}[minute/minutes], Earth time).${prompt}'
  14872: 'In addition to doubling up, you may also decline to roll the dice and stay with your current total (${color: 5}hold fast${color: 1}).${prompt}'
  14873: If your total ever goes over 11, you will automatically lose the game, regardless of the totals of other players. Knowing the right time to hold fast is one of the keys to staying in the match.${prompt}
  14874: Once all the players have held fast, the game is over and the results are announced. The player closest to 11 is declared the winner and receives all the gil in the pot (the original participation fees of all the players).${prompt}
  14875: 'Objective: Roll a six-sided die as many times as necessary to achieve a total as close to 11 as possible. You lose the instant your total exceeds 11.${prompt}'
  14876: 'If two or more players are the closest to 11 at the end of a match, the game is considered a ${color: 5}draw${color: 1} and all participation fees are repaid in full.${prompt}'
  14877: Once the game has started, fees will not be refunded for any reason unless the match results in a draw.${prompt}
  14878: |-
    It's here! It's here!
    The season of Celestial Nights is upon us! And to celebrate, the moogles are bringing together lost loves by offering free teleportation to San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst!${prompt}
  14879: If there's someone you've been longing to see, just let me know and I'll warp you right to their side (provided they are in either San d'Oria, Bastok, or Windurst), kupo!${prompt}

    San d'Oria.
    Bastok.
    Windurst.${prompt}
  14881: See you again, kupo!${prompt}
  14882: Oh, that's right! I almost forgot to give you this, kupo!${prompt}
  14883: Are you ready for another spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?${prompt}
  14884: |-
    We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon.
    Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!${prompt}
  14885: |-
    Oh, a new adventurer!
    Best of luck, kupo!${prompt}
  14886: |-
    Are you helping out the new adventurers?
    Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!${prompt}
  14887: Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!${prompt}
  14888: |-
    The face in the portrait you brought me is just...
    Kupupupu!${prompt}
  14889: |-
    You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo?
    Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.${prompt}
  14890: This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!${prompt}
  14891: |-
    To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal.
    Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!${prompt}
  14892: |-
    This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties.
    Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!${prompt}
  14893: |-
    Please come back with a different partner.
    It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!${prompt}
  14894: |-
    Your partner isn't ready to go.
    Please wait a little longer, kupo.${prompt}
  14895: |-
    Your partner must talk to me as well.
    I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.${prompt}
  14896: |-
    You can only choose one partner a day.
    Come back again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt}
  14897: |-
    Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner!
    You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!${prompt}
  14898: Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.${prompt}
  14899: Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?${prompt}
  14900: |-
    Are you ready to go?
    ${selection-lines}
    Ready, kupo!
    I'm too terrified, kupo!${prompt}
  14901: |-
    I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal.
    You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.${prompt}
  14902: |-
    If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you!
    Now, off you go, kupo!${prompt}
  14903: 'You can only carry one ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  14904: Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?${prompt}
  14905: |-
    Hey, you changed partners!
    You can't switch halfway through, kupo!${prompt}
  14906: |-
    Wait, the number of people in your party has changed!
    You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!${prompt}
  14907: |-
    Choose your partner wisely.
    Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!${prompt}
  14908: |-
    You there.
    I suppose you've heard the gossip flying around town--the talk of part-time ghosts?${prompt}
  14909: |-
    Have you heard?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I've heard.
    Part-time ghosts!?${prompt}
  14910: Then we may move on to more important matters.${prompt}
  14911: We haven't been able to locate enough volunteers to participate in this year's festivities, and are searching for adventurers who would be willing to aid us.${prompt}
  14912: All you will be required to do is dress up in one of these frightening costumes and wander about the city with the other specters.${prompt}
  14913: |-
    <Sigh>...
    Then allow me to explain.${prompt}
  14914: A memorial is currently being held in honor of a long-lost coven of witches known as the Dark Lilies.${prompt}
  14915: During the memorial, volunteers dressed up as the witches and spirits walk a course about the city in honor of the deceased.${prompt}
  14916: However, while we have filled all the spots for the witches, we are quite short on people willing to play the part of the monsters who follow the Lilies.${prompt}
  14917: Would you be willing to lend a hand, fine ${choice-player-gender}[sir/lady]?${prompt}
  14918: |-
    Will you help?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    Not a ghost of a chance.${prompt}
  14919: |-
    Ah... How droll.
    Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt}
  14920: |-
    Most excellent.
    There is one thing you must be aware of, however.${prompt}
  14921: The witches have the most important role in this memorial service. You are to tread only in their wake. If it is found that you have stepped ahead of one of the Lilies, you will be asked to return your costume and leave the procession.${prompt}
  14922: Though, we are a forgiving organization, and if you wish to participate once again, either speak with me or simply put on another costume and your request shall be granted.${prompt}
  14923: Ah yes, and one more thing. There are two citizens playing the parts of the witches Guwanana and Bikho Ronpotteh.${prompt}
  14924: You are to follow the fair Mithran maid dressed as Bikho. Remember this, as you will not receive any compensation in the event you join the wrong group.${prompt}
  14925: Ah, welcome back, adventurer. You have done well. The Dark Lilies would be pleased.${prompt}
  14926: Please take this as a token of our appreciation.${prompt}
  14927: It is a hat modeled after those worn by the Dark Lilies. Perhaps you might wear it during the season's festivities.${prompt}
  14928: Oh, and should you wish to aid us again, we would welcome your help. Many thanks, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  14929: |-
    What has befallen you?
    Do you wish to give up?${prompt}

    Give up?
    ${selection-lines}

    Not yet.${prompt}
  14931: |-
    A pity.
    Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt}
  14932: You are to follow the young maiden dressed as Guwanana. Remember this, as you will not receive any compensation in the event you join the wrong group.${prompt}
  14933: |-
    Good day!
    I suppose you've heard of all the people signing up to play ghosts in this year's festival, nay?${prompt}
  14934: |-
    Have you heard?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I've heard.
    Play ghosts!?${prompt}
  14935: I wouldn't expect anything less from an adventurer.${prompt}
  14936: |-
    I'll get straight to the point, then.
    We need volunteers to dress up as ghosts, specters, wights, and the like, and walk around the city in honor of the Dark Lilies.${prompt}
  14937: Would you be willing to participate? You will be rewarded nicely!${prompt}
  14938: |-
    Well, you adventurers are pretty busy, I guess.
    Let me give you the short version:${prompt}
  14939: We're putting on a grand parade for this season's Harvest Festival.${prompt}
  14940: We already have enough people to play the witches, but there can never be enough monsters, nay?${prompt}
  14941: That's why we need volunteers like you to make the parade even more exciting. Oh, worry not, adventurer. You will be rewarded nicely!${prompt}
  14942: |-
    Will you help?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    Not a ghost of a chance.${prompt}
  14943: |-
    Oh...
    Well, acting isn't everybody's cup of tea.
    I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt}
  14944: |-
    Thank you!
    Now, there is one thing you should know...${prompt}
  14945: The witches lead the procession. If you start getting any delusions of grandeur and work your way in front of the Lilies, you will be required to turn over your costume and forfeit all payment for services up to that point.${prompt}
  14946: But that doesn't mean you can't try again! Just put on another costume and get back in line. I'm sure you'll get the hang of things soon enough.${prompt}
  14947: 'Oh, and one more thing. There are two witches in this season''s parade: Selma and Pretty Heart.${prompt}'
  14948: You're to be stationed in Selma's parade, so don't go wandering over to Pretty Heart's, hear me?${prompt}
  14949: Good luck!${prompt}
  14950: Excellent job, ${name-player}! You've done the witches proud.${prompt}
  14951: Here's the reward I promised.${prompt}
  14952: |-
    It's a witch hat.
    The design matches those worn by the Dark Lilies. Put it on, and go have fun. Forget about ghosts for a while.${prompt}
  14953: Though, if you want to volunteer again, I'll be right here waiting for you!${prompt}
  14954: Giving up the ghost, eh?${prompt}
  14955: |-
    Oh...
    Well, acting isn't everybody's cup of tea.
    I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt}
  14956: You're to be stationed in Pretty Heart's parade, so don't go wandering over to Selma's, hear me?${prompt}
  14957: |-
    Hi, I'm Gertrude.
    I'm helping with some of the Harvest Festival activities. Have you heard about our hiring policies?${prompt}
  14958: |-
    Heard about them?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    Not at all.${prompt}
  14959: |-
    You have?
    Well, that makes my job easier, then.${prompt}
  14960: So, would you like to sign up for the Procession of the Lilies?${prompt}
  14961: |-
    No?
    Then let me fill you in on the details. We are currently holding a memorial for the Dark Lilies, in which two women dressed as members of the lost coven lead a party of spirits around the city.${prompt}
  14962: There is a shortage of volunteers for the witches' undead followers, and I was wondering if you would like to help.${prompt}
  14963: |-
    Sign up?
    ${selection-lines}
    Right away!
    Not today.${prompt}
  14964: |-
    Adventurers are often very busy, or so I've heard.
    Please come back if you change your mind.${prompt}
  14965: |-
    Wonderful.
    There are just two more things I must warn you of, however.${prompt}
  14966: First and foremost, during the procession, the witches are boss, so don't even think of stepping in front of them. If you do, your costume will be immediately confiscated.${prompt}
  14967: Ah, but if that happens, you need not worry. Just put on another costume and try again!${prompt}
  14968: Secondly, there are two witches in the city--Maryse and Poseaulloie.${prompt}
  14969: You are to join with Poseaulloie's congregation.${prompt}
  14970: Good luck!${prompt}
  14971: How did you fare...? Was the witch pleased?${prompt}
  14972: |-
    Either way, your help has been invaluable.
    Would you accept this in appreciation?${prompt}
  14973: |-
    It's a witch hat.
    Please wear it in the festivities and forget about ghosts and spirits for a while...${prompt}
  14974: Though, if you have time, we would gladly accept your help again.${prompt}
  14975: |-
    What's wrong?
    Have you grown tired of your duties?${prompt}
  14976: |-
    Oh, I see...
    Well, please return to me if you find your patience for them restored.${prompt}
  14977: You are to join with Maryse's congregation.${prompt}
  14978: I shall let you know when there is another opening.${prompt}
  14979: I'll let you know when a spot opens up.${prompt}
  14980: You'll be the first to know when I have a new opening.${prompt}
  14981: Ooops! You've stepped in front of the witch!${prompt}
  14982: You can't stop now. You've just started!${prompt}
  14983: You've only just begun.${prompt}
  14984: There's still a long way to go.${prompt}
  14985: Hope you didn't make any other plans, because you're not even close to being finished.${prompt}
  14986: Almost halfway...${prompt}
  14987: It's still a little too early to go back.${prompt}
  14988: Leave the procession now and someone might be peeved.${prompt}
  14989: Just a little longer...${prompt}
  14990: You're almost done!${prompt}
  14991: Alright! It's time to collect your reward!${prompt}
  14992: You've joined the procession.${prompt}
  14993: Adventurer! Adventurer!${prompt}
  14994: |-
    Might you lend a poor Moogle a hand?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure!

    Not today.${prompt}
  14995: |-
    A thousand thanks, kupo!
    Your participation in the Neo Crystal War will benefit your nation in ways beyond imagination!${prompt}
  14996: |-
    Rules? Why, they are simple, my friend!
    All you need do is sneak your way into beastman lairs and retrieve shards from the ${color: 5}cyclopean crystals${color: 1} located about the strongholds, kupo!${prompt}
  14997: Which lairs? Must I tell you everything, adventurer? Moogle intelligence reports that the crystals can be found in the Ghelsba Outpost, Davoi, the Palborough Mines, Giddeus, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja. Now what are you waiting for, kupo!?${prompt}
  14998: You see, recently there has been much unrest amongst our many Moogle factions, kupo.${prompt}
  14999: Why, you ask? Well, at one of our gatherings, an argument broke out regarding the Crystal War 20 years gone.${prompt}
  15000: 'It all started with the question: which nation played the biggest role in the allied forces'' victory over the beastmen armies?${prompt}'
  15001: And from there things degraded into a shouting match pitting San d'Oria versus Bastok versus Windurst, kupo...${prompt}
  15002: However, at the end of the day, no one could present hard evidence to the claim of their nation's greatness.${prompt}
  15003: And that is when one of our elders came up with a foolproof method to put an end to our doubts--we would have adventurers from all three nations fight the war again, kupo!${prompt}
  15004: By fighting, I don't mean fighting each other, but fighting the beastmen like our fathers did 20 years ago!${prompt}
  15005: One of the ways the allied armies were able to defeat the enemy was by intercepting and cutting off the Shadow Lord's crystal supply routes.${prompt}
  15006: We want you and other adventurers from across Vana'diel to take on the roles of allied solders and infiltrate beastman strongholds, kupo.${prompt}
  15007: Once inside, you are to locate large formations where the beastmen have been storing crystals over the past two decades...${prompt}
  15008: '...and break off as many shards as possible, then bring them back here, kupo.${prompt}'
  15009: The nation that brings back the most shards will be declared the Crystal War's “Most Valuable Nation” and the Moogles' squabbles will finally come to an end.${prompt}
  15010: |-
    So, what do you say, kupo?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'm in.
    Maybe later.${prompt}
  15011: Kupopo... Did I mention that there will be wondrous prizes to adventurers from the victorious nation? Oh well, if you have a change of heart, you'll know where to find me!${prompt}
  15012: Kupopo...${prompt}
  15013: Welcome back, adventurer! Let me see how many shards you have retrieved, kupo...${prompt}
  15014: 'My records show that you have brought your nation a total of ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[shard/shards], but I know you''re not done yet, are you?${prompt}'

  15018: 'Congratulations on your victory, ${choice: 0}[San d''Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian]! Your nation has been selected Crystal War MVN, kupo! As a reward, I shall teleport you to any nation of your choice!${prompt}'

  15146: Assured.${prompt}
  15147: Celestial Nights has begun, kupo!${prompt}
  15148: An event based on the timeless, tear-jerking tale of tragedy between Prince Yahiko of the Eastern Nation and Princess Amdina of the Western Nation is being held, kupo!${prompt}
  15149: In an interpretive recreation of the tale, two actors have assumed the roles of the prince and princess on a sizzling hot date!${prompt}
  15150: But all is not well...${prompt}
  15151: You see, the town is overflowing with alluringly attractive ladies, kupo.${prompt}
  15152: |-
    Why is that such a bad thing, you ask?
    By distracting the prince from giving his undivided attention to the princess, these vivacious vixens could ruin the event, kupo.${prompt}
  15153: |-
    That must not be allowed to happen!
    If the actor in the prince's role threatens towards fickleness, it's your duty to slap him back to reality--literally!${prompt}
  15154: |-
    And we can't forget about the actress playing the princess, either.
    She's under a lot of pressure to perform, and is prone to being plagued with severe self-doubt about her feelings towards her co-star, kupo.${prompt}
  15155: Only with your moral support could she hope to maintain confidence and perform at her brilliant best. A simple nod would go a long way to reaffirm positive thoughts, while a shake of the head would do wonders to cast out negative ones, kupo!${prompt}
  15156: And going back to the scandalous seductresses I mentioned earlier, you can prevent them from disrupting this royal rendezvous by turning their attention to you. A wave of the hand should do the trick, kupo!${prompt}
  15157: Whatever happens, you must ensure that the date--the event--goes smoothly! I pray for your success on this most meaningful of missions, kupo!${prompt}
  15158: |-
    Princess Amdina, mine one and only!
    I have so longed to once more behold thee! Thou art even more beautiful than when last we met!
  15159: "Thy words pleaseth me, my sweet prince. \nI, too, have ached to be by thy side again."
  15160: Let us make this a reunion that shall never be forgotten! Shall we, my princess?
  15161: Yes, my prince!
  15162: Prince Yahiko, pray forgive me my boldness...but there is something I desire.
  15163: Thou needest but name it, and thine it shall be! There is naught I would deny thee, apple of mine eye.
  15164: |-
    <Blush>...${wait-36: 2}
    Even if thy heart is what I desire, my prince?
  15165: |-
    Hahaha!
    My princess, mine heart has been thine since the day I first laid mine eyes upon thee.
  15166: |-
    Prince Yahiko, pray tell me true...
    I would know why thou dost love me so.
  15167: To answer thy question fully is to tell a tale grander than the greatest epics. Thy beautiful almond eyes that glimmer brighter than the most precious jewels...thy voice of honey that resoundeth more sweetly than angel song...
  15168: Thine entire being is as a soothing spring rain that hath come to nourish the arid desert of my lonely existence.
  15169: |-
    <Blush>...
    My...my prince...I know not what to say...
  15170: Prince Yahiko?
  15171: What is it, my precious?
  15172: |-
    <Blush>...
    It...it is nothing...
  15173: Sweet princess, thou needest not hide anything from me.
  15174: Mmm, now that's my kind of guy. I'm gonna get me some of this!
  15175: Hey there, handsome! You got a little time to sparrre for a lonely girl like me?
  15176: A-and who dost thou assume to be?
  15177: (Of all the nerve! I'm not lettaruing you lay a finger on him, you feline floozie!)
  15178: Taint Prince Yahiko not with thy vile touch, hell-spawned grimalkin!
  15179: Geesh, what's your prrroblem? Can't a girl have any fun around here?
  15180: Yoo-hoo! This way, handsome.♪
  15181: Wh-what's this? My body moveth of its own accord? Pre...preposterous!
  15182: P-Prince Yahiko! Whither dost thou think...!
  15183: Fair maiden! As a moth fluttereth by the dancing flame of a lantern, so too am I powerless in thine intoxicating presence!
  15184: Awww, aren't you just the sweetest little thing! I can't rrresist a man who knows how to speak his mind.
  15185: V-variety...is the spice of life.
  15186: Egads! Perilously close was I to plunging into an abyss of bliss whence escape is impossible...
  15187: |-
    Awww, and I almost had him...
    But it ain't over yet, handsome!
  15188: |-
    Princess Amdina! My beloved!
    Please, find it in thy heart to forgive this foolish prince!
  15189: |-
    Hmph!${wait-36: 2}
    <Sigh>... I believed thou wouldst return to me, my prince.
  15190: Never again shall I leave thy side! This, I swear upon mine honor!
  15191: Hm? Do I know you?
  15192: Do you mind? I'm trying to snag myself a prey of prrrincely proportion here.
  15193: You've caught me at a bad time. Why don't you be a good little adventurerrr and go whack some rarabs?
  15194: (Walking side by side with my co-star like this...it's as though we're really-weally a couple!)
  15195: (I've never thought to look at a colleague in this lightaru before, but he's dangerously close to being the man of my dreamy-weams.)
  15196: (Hmm...but that guy over there is more to my taste...)
  15197: (His portrayal of Yahiko's love and devotion for Amdina feels incredibly authentic. It's hard to believe that it's all just an actaru. Could it be that he's actually...smitten-witten with me?)
  15198: (How should I reply if he asks me out aftaru the event is over? Nooo, I need more time to thinky-wink over my answer!)
  15199: (Nah, he's just a decent actor, that's all. I have to give him some creditaru for that. Oh well...)
  15200: (All the men in Windurst will be like putty-wutty in my hands by the time this event is over. Teehee!)
  15201: (I can be so cold and heartless sometimes. Shamey-wame on me!)
  15202: (Hmm, where did all the guys disappear to? Talk about a disappointing turnoutaru...)
  15203: (He's so dreamy-weamy to look at from this angle. I could stare at his profile all day!)
  15204: (Aaah! Any more of this and my legs will turn into butter!)
  15205: (But, ewww... His frontage would certainly benefit from some renovation...)
  15206: (I've never feltaru so comfortable being with someone before. I wonder what this means...)
  15207: (Waaah! My poor little heart is beating like crazy-wazy! What's happening to me?)
  15208: (Well, after having rehearsed together for weeks on endy-wend, I suppose it's only natural.)
  15209: (If only a man--preferably a dark and handsome one--would bursty-wurst onto the scene and rescue me from my boredom...)
  15210: (Ugh... And I thought raising chocobos was a drag. A bit of unscripted excitementaru would be welcome right about now...)
  15211: (But then again, a scandalous episode wouldn't go down well with the agency.)
  15212: (This has been bothering me for a while, but how did a tiny Tarutaru like me ever-wever land the role of Princess Amdina?)
  15213: (Why, that would be because of your irresistible cuteness, silly!)
  15214: (They mightaru not be showing it, but I just know the townsfolk are ridiculing me behind my back...)
  15215: (Th-that girl--she was auditioning for the role of Princess Amdina alongside me! I knew I had seeny-ween her somewhere before. Hmm...the crowd seems to be paying more attention to her.)
  15216: (Snap out of it! I'm the one who was chosen to play the princess, not her! She may not be bad to look at, but there's little-wittle else that could be said in the positive.)
  15217: (Oh Goddess, I'm never-wever going to live this down...)
  15218: (The more I play the role of Princess Amdina, the more I find myself detestaruing her.)
  15219: (But this is probably-wobably just a skewed interpretation of her personality. I'll betaru she was a real sweetheart in real life.)
  15220: (It's such a chore trying to stay in character for a role you're averse to. I wish I hadn't auditioned.)
  15221: (I wish I could justaru enjoy the festival as one of the townsfolk. Maybe I could wrap up this shifty-wift a little early.)
  15222: (I can't believe I even considered playing hookey! An actress is nothing if not professional!)
  15223: (It shouldn't hurty-wurt to skip the next few lines. Yeah, I think I'll do that.)
  15224: (Oooh, the guy that walked by just now--if I could just tradey-wade linkpearls with him...)
  15225: |-
    Princess Amdina!
    Whither dost thou go?
  15226: |-
    Doth my presence...pleaseth thee no longer, my princess?
    If...if that is how it must be, I... <Sniff>....
  15227: (A-are those tears welling up in his puppy-wuppy-dog eyes!?)
  15228: |-
    N-never, my sweet prince! Thou art mine one and only delight!
    My mind but wandered in contemplation of what fate hath in store for the two of us!
  15229: Citizen, canst thou spare not the courtesy to allow the princess and I this rare private interlude?
  15230: There is not a single woman in the world who can rival the loveliness of my princess!
  15231: As long as I live, no harm shall ever befall the princess. This, I swear upon mine honor!
  15232: I can bear not even the thought of life without Princess Amdina.
  15233: Only with Princess Amdina doth my existence hold meaning.
  15234: There is not a single moment where the thought of Princess Amdina doth not occupy my mind!
  15235: Citizen, canst thou not see that I am attending to...official business?
  15236: My perfect prince... <Sigh>
  15237: The prince concealeth behind his majestic facade an innocent, childlike aspect that hath awakened my maternal instincts.
  15238: I had always been skeptical towards the idea of destiny. And then I met Prince Yahiko...
  15239: Even when we are far apart, the mere thought of the prince bringeth a comforting warmth to my soul.
  15240: <Sigh> How I hope that one day he will maketh me his bride...
  15241: Only I hold the key which unlocketh his soul!
  15242: |-
    I beseech thee, loyal citizen!
    Deliver the prince back to mine arms!
  15243: Hey therrre, ${choice-player-gender}[handsome/gorgeous]! Hope you're enjoying your stay in beautiful Windurst!
  15244: That's it. Any more thees and thous and I'm going to vomitaru.
  15245: Huh? I don't remember this being in the script...
  15246: I'm going home. Don't bother-wother to call me.
  15247: Wh-wh-what!?
  15248: |-
    Nooo!
    Princess Amdina! Don't leave me!
  15249: Prince Yahiko, I shall never forget our reunion this day.
  15250: Nor I, my dear princess.
  15251: It is our fervent hope that thou hast thoroughly enjoyed the Celestial Nights event.${prompt}
  15252: We present this gift to thee, as a token of our gratitude for thine unrelenting support.${prompt}

    Hello, faithful fans!
    Mighty Maiden Uka here!
  15308: |-
    Just by looking at your smiling faces, I can tell you're all having a great time at this year's Sunbreeze Festival!
    So, are you rrready for some music? I know we're ready to sing our hearrrts out!
  15309: |-
    ...Um, or at least I am.
    Where in sweet Selbina could Mumor be!?
  15310: |-
    Oh well, the show must go on.
    It's a little embarrassing to sing by myself, but any entertainer worth her miraclesalt would jump at this opporrrtunity.
    This is my chance to go solo!
  15311: Everyone, feast your earrrs upon my astounding aria.
  15312: |-
    Your cacophonous warbling is enough to make me vacate the contents of my stomach.
    These people are not stupid, either... They know that without your partner, you aren't even worth the stage on which you stand.
  15313: Who goes there!?
  15314: |-
    Who, indeed... Understandable, since I believe this is the first time I've deigned to grace you with my presence.
    I am a diva. Does that appellation ring any bells for you, pray tell?
  15315: A diva!? They truly exist!?
  15316: Oh, so you have indeed heard of my kind? No wonder you were once my master's favorite archfiend.
  15317: Though, in all truth, the title “archfiend” refers to nothing more than washed-up hacks who possess neither the drive nor the talent to reach for the stars...of divadom!
  15318: |-
    Yet now you've thrown even that away, settling for a mundane life of belching out dull drivel at vulgar venues.
    Someone as wretched as you holds no value whatsoever.
  15319: '...'
  15320: |-
    Or do you...?
    I heard you associate with some upstart floozy who dares defy my master and dissuades archfiends from our cause. Do you know where she is?
  15321: |-
    Well, it seems you're all alone.
    No matter. She'll simply have to wait until I'm finished with you.
  15322: Cooome now, my preeecious!♪
  15323: |-
    Of course, someone of my sublime stature would never condescend to personally dispatch with a peon like you.
    This minion should prove more than a sufficient substitute for accomplishing that task.
  15324: |-
    The crowd here may be raucous, but drown out its pesky din.♪
    Now give yourself up to your dreams, just cast away your strife.★
    Next, let your heavy eyelids fall and drool drip down your chin.♪
    This soothing, tranquil lullaby leaves all bereft of life.★
  15325: |-
    Even without Mumor...I can cut this cocky diva down to size!
    Everyone, lend me your strength!
  15326: Yeep!
  15327: Hmph, it seems you may possess at least an iota of skill after all.
  15328: |-
    I'm not alone. I have the whole audience on my side!
    Let's do this, everyone!
  15329: Neo Crrrystal Jig!!!
  15330: Super Crrrusher Jig!!!
  15331: Shining Summerrr Samba!!!
  15332: Lovely Mirrracle Waltz!!!
  15333: Grrr...!
  15334: Don't just stand there and take it, you invariably incompetent imbecile!
  15335: Neo Crystal Jig!
  15336: Super Crusher Jig!
  15337: Shining Summer Samba!
  15338: Lovely Miracle Waltz!
  15339: Urk...!
  15340: Well now...
  15341: We must all work as one! Please, lend me your strrrength!
  15342: I-it can't be...
  15343: Ahahaha! Those earth tones truly do bring your outfit together, Uka.
  15344: |-
    You archfiends exist as nothing more than mere stepping stones on my path to glory!
    It matters not how many enemies assail me. I can dispatch them all with but the bat of an eye!
  15345: You may now exit stage right. Oh, and I don't think you'll need to worry about any encores.
  15346: Fear not, I'll be sure to invite your friend to the after-party as well!
  15347: Ahhhhhh!!!
  15348: Bwahahaha!!!
  15349: And so, without Mumor, Uka quickly succumbed to the diva and was banished to an interdimensional purgatory...
  15350: |-
    Be more supportive of her and you can overturn what has just transpired.
    Band together and cheer on Uka to save her from the diabolical diva!
  15351: |-
    Haaah, haaah... I've got to hand it to you. I don't think I can beat you by myself.
    If only Mumor were herrre, too.
  15352: Mumor? Oh, you mean that sorry excuse for a nemesis.
  15353: Just how might the addition of one more classless poseur change what is so obviously inevitable?
  15354: |-
    You certainly are persistent. My master must have seen...
    But enough chatter! This time I shall truly send you off into eternal slumber with a special lullaby.
  15355: In the name of joy and happiness, I shall punish you!
  15356: Mumor!
  15357: Please forgive me, Uka. I tried oh-so-hard not to be late!
  15358: |-
    You see, I was in a meeting with the produc--
    I mean, I took too long deciding what to wear. Teehee!
  15359: A what with whom?
  15360: |-
    Hmmm? You must be hearing things.
    Who is this moogle, anyway?
  15361: |-
    Huh? Oh, yeah.
    She's a diva--one of Ullegore's songstrrresses--which means she has a much more talented voice than any of us forrrmer archfiends.
  15362: |-
    Another one?
    I'm sick and tired of Ullegore's lackeys trying to ruin our performances!
  15363: |-
    Ruin? Your act doesn't leave much to ruin.
    Besides, this stage was built for a diva of my caliber, not amateurs such as yourselves.
  15364: H-how dare you! My sultry singing is the perfect complement to Uka's dynamic dancing, and that's why our popularity soars higher than any airship!
  15365: Think what you will. We shall see if you're still singing the same tune after I show you how to hold a true note.

  15516: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt}
  15517: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  15518: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt}
  15519: |-
    Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.
    If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt}
  15520: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  15521: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  15522: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  15523: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  15524: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  15525: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  15526: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  15527: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  15528: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  15529: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  15530: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  15531: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  15532: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  15533: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  15534: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  15535: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  15536: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  15537: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  15538: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  15539: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  15540: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  15541: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  15542: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  15543: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  15544: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  15545: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  15546: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  15547: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  15548: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  15549: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  15550: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  15551: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  15552: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  15553: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  15554: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  15555: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  15556: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  15557: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  15558: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  15559: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  15560: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  15561: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  15562: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  15563: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  15564: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  15565: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  15566: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  15567: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  15568: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  15569: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  15570: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  15571: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  15572: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  15573: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  15574: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  15575: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  15576: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  15577: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  15578: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  15579: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  15580: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  15581: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  15582: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  15583: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  15584: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  15585: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  15586: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  15587: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  15588: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  15589: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  15590: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  15591: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  15592: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  15593: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  15594: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  15595: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  15596: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  15597: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  15598: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  15599: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?
    Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt}

  15614: |-
    Oh, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too!
    What skills does it require? Let's see here...${prompt}
  15615: |-
    Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one!
    Ain't synergy grand?${prompt}
  15616: |-
    Wait! No, don't tell me.
    You strike me as a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.${prompt}
  15617: |-
    Learn about synergy?
    ${selection-lines}
    Not today.
    Teach me!
    Just give me ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  15618: |-
    A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living.
    Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.${prompt}
  15619: |-
    I thought you'd never ask!
    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  15620: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  15621: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'
  15622: |-
    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  15623: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  15624: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  15625: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  15626: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  15627: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  15628: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}
  15629: |-
    That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.
    Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt}
  15630: |-
    An aspiring synergist, I see!
    If you're looking for ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you've certainly come to the right place.${prompt}
  15631: |-
    I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for ${number: 0} gil.
    A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?${prompt}
  15632: '${number: 0} gil, paid in full!${prompt}'
  15633: |-
    As promised, here's your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you!
    How's that for a deal?${prompt}
  15634: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  15635: Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.${prompt}
  15636: A super-special Starlight Celebration to you, ambitious adventurer!${prompt}
  15637: What am I saying!? This is hardly the time for gleeful greetings or alliterative addresses, kupo!${prompt}
  15638: |-
    Even as we speak, overzealous Goblins are partaking not just in the Starlight Celebration spirit, but others' precious presents!
    These Gobbies bear no bad blood, but their covetous capers are the cause of much consternation, kupo.${prompt}
  15639: |-
    And to make matters worse, they've even filched the furnishings the MHMU ordered from the guilds...
    I know the saying, “If you give a Goblin goulash...” but this is just rikupulous!${prompt}
  15640: |-
    Please, ${name-player}, I beseech you!
    Find the Goblins traipsing about town and teach them the meaning of private property once and for all!
    (By affably asking them to relinquish what they requisitioned, kupo.)${prompt}
  15641: |-
    It may seem like the MHMU is just exploiting the nearest adventurer, but nay! You--and only you--are capable of restoring resplendence and revelry to the realm.
    Now go forth and fulfill the festive fate we thrust upon you, kupo!${prompt}
  15642: |-
    Kupopopo!
    Have you forgotten your merry mission already? Get giddy, gift-grabbing Goblins around town to give back people's goods, then go gab to a Moogle when you're done.${prompt}
  15643: |-
    And remember, Gobbies like to stick their noses in other creatures' business, if you know what I mean.
    Snuff out your smell so they can't sense your spoils, kupo.${prompt}
  15644: |-
    And remember, Goblins go cuckoo for comestibles, kupo.
    Offer them their favorite food, for they should forget you even exist.${prompt}
  15645: |-
    And remember, Goblins just want to jump for joy and jubilation at this jocular time of year.
    Bequeath beastmen bills or bedazzling bijoux to them and you may find yourself furnished with furnishings in return, kupo.${prompt}
  15646: |-
    Great glorious Goddess, you've managed to procure a present! Praise be to your positively prodigious persistence!
    ...And your altruistic attitude after you return it to its rightful remitter, kupo!${prompt}
  15647: |-
    It looks like this gift is from someone named ${entity: 0}. Seek out the sender and start spreading some Starlight spirit, kupo!
    Oh, and watch out for mischievous Goblin mitts, my little gofer--I mean adventurer!${prompt}
  15648: |-
    Wonderful work, warden of weal!
    However, since giving is greater than receiving, how about giving ${entity: 0} word that you were able to deliver the present?${prompt}
  15649: |-
    The considerable amount of charity you've shown complete strangers cannot be overstated, kupo.
    Without your magnanimity, moxie, and master mediation skills, this year's Starlight Celebration would have been a much dimmer affair.${prompt}
  15650: |-
    Yet to polish this party to the point of pristine luster, more Goblins must be taught the difference between naughty and nice!
    Remember, once you give back a gift, seal the deal by simply sauntering over to the nearest moogle.
    We're counting on you, kupo!${prompt}
  15651: The MHMU humbly offers you this token of our thanks, not only for making the world a brighter place, but for tolerating our moogle mummery and the voluminous vats of verbosity that violated your virgin ears.${prompt}
  15652: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! I forgot those festive Gobbies are still frolicking with our furnishings, kupo!${prompt}
  15653: |-
    I'm so sorry to solicit further favors from you, but could you kindly retrieve those as well?
    Pretty please with paprika on top? You wouldn't want to keep us from rewarding the good boys and girls of Vana'diel, would you, kupo?${prompt}
  15654: |-
    Kupo ho ho! Do my deteriorating eyes deceive me, or is that one of the furnishings we ordered?
    We'd planned on giving them all to needy orphans, but you've done so much for the MHMU recently, why don't you have this one? 'Tis the season, so they say.${prompt}
  15655: |-
    What an astounding accomplishment, as expected of an adventurer like you!
    We are eternally grateful for the copious kindnesses you've conferred upon us, kupo.${prompt}
  15656: |-
    Word around the union fountain is that other nations' furnishings still remain at large. Would it be too terrible a torment to traipse around town--peepers peeled for gregarious Gobbies ogling purported presents--the next time you visit another nation?
    The MHMU would be forever in your debt, kupo.${prompt}
  15657: (Wheeew, way to whisk that one under the rug. I could never tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] that we got distracted by the dazzling decorations and had the furnishings nabbed from nigh under our noses!)${prompt}
  15658: Happy toy, happy toy, where be me happy toy?♪
  15659: |-
    Ev'ry girl, ev'ry boy, ev'rybody, happy toy!
    Me nose holes smell the joy,
    The joy from happy toy!
    Wheeere cooould iiit beee?♪
  15660: |-
    This for me? In-doo-bid-ably!
    Could be gooder, but it not bad.
  15661: |-
    Waaah! It you!
    You give yum-yums for me tum-tum. Good ${choice-player-gender}[guy/girl]!
  15662: |-
    Not for us, not for me?
    I give it back. Now you happy?
    Happy toy, happy toy, where be me happy toy?♪
  15663: |-
    No no no no no!
    Go away! Nose holes busy sniff for happy toy!
  15664: '...'
  15665: You have friend, you do? We Gobbies have friend too.
  15666: Yum-yums for me? Gobbies remember...till our tummies go rumble-rumble again.
  15667: |-
    For me!? Why give so nice thing to me!?
    Me so happy head go boom! So boom!
    But first, me need give happy toy to you too.
  15668: |-
    Happy toy? For me?
    Why you give so good thing to me?
    But no can take. Me have no happy toy for you.
  15669: |-
    Blech. What this yucky thing?
    It make me want upgut food. Take it away.
  15670: |-
    What? But how...?
    If that's truly from ${entity: 0}, that must mean...you stole it and you're ransoming it back to me!
    If you think for one moment that I'd pay scum like you, you'd best think twice!${prompt}
  15671: |-
    Oh, I see. My apologies.
    How silly of me. Everyone knows how mischievous Goblins get during the Starlight Celebration season. I read somewhere that it's got something to do with the moon and the tides or whatnot.${prompt}
  15672: |-
    Anyway, sorry to trouble you, but could you deliver this in my stead?
    I may look like a strapping young lad, but I have this illness that prevents me from doing the same task twice in one day. Quite troublesome, really.${prompt}
  15673: |-
    Also, could you do me a favor and report back to me after you're done?
    I didn't want to spend the extra gil for delivery confirmation with times as tough as they are, you know?${prompt}
  15674: |-
    I take it you delivered my present safe and sound?
    Oh, and it was well received, too? Ha, you didn't need to tell me that, for my gifts are always a hit.
    I guess I should thank you though, seeing as how you played a tiny part in my Starlight Celebration success.${prompt}
  15675: |-
    Waaah, a cutthroat! Take anything you want, just not my lucky chocobo hose, please! I...
    Wait, isn't that the gift I sent ${entity: 0}? You didn't steal that too, did you!?${prompt}
  15676: |-
    What!? You...valiantly wrested it from the clutches of a greedy Goblin so you could return it to me?
    I just knew my ${choice-player-gender}[handsome champion/fair handmaiden] in resplendent regalia would come some day!${prompt}
  15677: |-
    I'm sure you've been through quite a few trials and tribulations just getting this back to me, your fair lady. However, my hands are tied at the moment and I can't take this present to ${entity: 0}.
    Therefore, I command you, my loyal follower, to act as my liaison and deliver it unscathed. I have no doubt that you'll succeed, since a ${choice-player-gender}[knight/handmaiden] will do anything to serve and protect ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] mistress.${prompt}
  15678: And please don't forget to check in with me after the delivery is made. Every ${choice-player-gender}[champion/handmaiden] knows that's the ${choice-player-gender}[chivalrous/proper] thing to do.${prompt}
  15679: |-
    How fared your journey, my ${choice-player-gender}[courageous champion/humble handmaiden]?
    Oh, I simply knew I could place my complete trust in you! You've not only made your fair lady quite proud, but saved the Starlight Celebration from those covetous beastmen! Oh, joyous day!${prompt}
  15680: 'I beg your pardon, but I cannot help but notice that this is the parcel I sent to ${entity: 0}. How might you have come by it?${prompt}'
  15681: |-
    Ah, I see. Those Goblin rapscallions still show a complete and utter disregard for social graces, would you not agree?
    At any rate, you seem to possess a rather strong sense of justice, and for that I am most grateful.${prompt}
  15682: 'Could you also find it within your heart to see that this package reaches ${entity: 0} safely? I may be a man of humble means, but you will certainly have my eternal gratitude and undying admiration.${prompt}'
  15683: |-
    Oh my. This utterly slipped my addled mind.
    I am truly sorry, but I fear I must heap one more request upon your already burdened back. Could you please report back to me after you've made the delivery?
    It would undoubtedly lessen the anxiety weighing down my fragile heart.${prompt}
  15684: |-
    Goddess be good, you have returned! And with favorable tidings, no?
    Splendid. Absolutely splendid. Thanks to you, I feel as if I could burst into a Starlight carol at any moment. Fa-la-la-la～♪.${prompt}
  15685: |-
    What doth bring thee 'fore these rheumy eyes, orbs that pierce the soul and a stranger's guise?
    Harken, thou hast ${entity: 0}'s present, from whom hast thou received such consent?${prompt}
  15686: |-
    'Tis an entertaining tale with which thy jowls doth flail,
    A tale of Goblins run amok, and wretched me bereft of luck.
    Still, thanks are in store for completing this chore with a dearth of gore.${prompt}
  15687: |-
    While these next words may conjure a storm, I cannot assist thee in any form.
    Thus, I entreat thee to heed the call...deliver this gift to ${entity: 0} once and for all!${prompt}
  15688: |-
    'Fore I finish this lengthy tirade, one last request must be made.
    Once the gift hath changed hands, return at once for further plans.${prompt}
  15689: |-
    Thou hast safely returned from thy trial? Upon us both doth Altana smile!
    To thee, the savior of the Starlight Celebration, I do give heartfelt acclamations!${prompt}
  15690: |-
    Wh-wh-what have you got there? It looks awfully-wafully like the gift I gave to ${entity: 0}.
    Did something happen? P-p-please don't tell me that ${entity: 0} passy-wassed away!${prompt}
  15691: |-
    ...It was just a G-g-goblin prank?
    Sorry to overreactaru. I had a t-t-traumatic experience last Starlight Devastation--er, Celebration! So now I always feary-wear the worst.
    By the way, th-th-thank you for getting my gift back.${prompt}
  15692: 'As you can guess, m-m-my comfort zone is rather itty-bitty. I know you must be expired--tired! But can you please helpy-welp me and deliver my present to ${entity: 0}?${prompt}'
  15693: |-
    After you pass on--the gift! Pass the gift on! Then c-c-could you report back to me?
    I truly-wuly want to know how ${entity: 0} reacts.${prompt}
  15694: |-
    Ah, you're back!
    It's ${entity: 0}'s most perished, er, cherished possession, you say? Wh-wh-what lofty-wofty praise!
    I can't thank you enough for your c-c-contributions, adventurer.${prompt}
  15695: |-
    So many nasty-wasty things happened to me today, I'm just too moody-woody to listen to your blather!
    Begone before I--wait, isn't that my present to ${entity: 0}?${prompt}
  15696: Ugh, quit barking like a bog dog, ${choice-player-gender}[brother-wother/sister-wister]! I don't give a ham and cheese about giddy Goblins or lazy moogles.${prompt}
  15697: |-
    You think you're so great because you saved my present from some baddie-waddies? Bah humbug-wumbug!
    If you're gonna stick your nosey-wose in others' business, then you bettaru finish what you started!
    You'll be taking that gift on over to ${entity: 0}, I tell you what!${prompt}
  15698: |-
    And don't think for a minute-winute that I'm going to let you get away with ruining my day! Report back here for a tongue-lashing when you're done!
    Now get going before I gutaru you right here and now!${prompt}
  15699: |-
    Hmph, so you're stupid as well as rude? Are you so subservient that you'd actually come backy-wack for a beating?
    Get out of my face! You disgustaru me. Oh, and Merry Starlight!${prompt}
  15700: 'Hey, I sent that to ${entity: 0}. Why do you have it?${prompt}'
  15701: |-
    Hmmm. Stolen by Gobbies, huh?
    Thanks for getting it back.${prompt}
  15702: 'Sorry to burden you, but could you bring it to ${entity: 0} again for me?${prompt}'
  15703: Also, I'd like it if you could please fill me in when you're done.${prompt}
  15704: |-
    I see you've returned.
    Mmm...that's good news indeed. Thank you for the kindness you've shown me and my friend.${prompt}
  15705: |-
    What have we here? A cat burrrglar?
    How dare you despoil the innocent people of our fair nation!${prompt}
  15706: |-
    What am I talking about?
    That's the prrresent I sent ${entity: 0}! How could you have it if you didn't steal it!?${prompt}
  15707: |-
    Oh, I see. You're a defender of justice too.
    Good job negotiating with those Goblin scum. I just hope that rrrepeating that story to everyone you've saved hasn't got you hacking up hairballs.${prompt}
  15708: 'But enough tail wagging. I have some prey I need to take care of, so could you rrredeliver that gift to ${entity: 0} and report back to me when you''re done?${prompt}'
  15709: |-
    What timing! I've just rrreturned from my own mission.
    Whew, good thing ${entity: 0} liked it! That little trinket was as high priced as the hair on a cat's back!
    Anyway, thanks for your help. If your fur ever gets rubbed the wrong way, give me a sign and I'll come rrroaring to the rescue!${prompt}
  15710: |-
    A present...from ${entity: 0}? Oh, glorious day!
    This is for all those times I never got a present and kept telling myself next year will be the one.${prompt}
  15711: |-
    I'm at a loss for what to say! I'm just overwhelmed with a waterfall of emotion!
    Thank you so much!${prompt}
  15712: |-
    And please thank ${entity: 0} the next time you see that good samaritan.
    The person who said, “'Tis better to give than receive” probably never had a gift drought as long as mine. I feel fantastic!${prompt}
  15713: 'Oh, is that...a present? From ${entity: 0}, you say?${prompt}'
  15714: |-
    Ugh, it figures. Did it come with a card that says something pathetic like “I've died a thousand deaths drowning in the depths of your eyes”?
    That scoundrel has been stalking me ever since we happened to meet one day on a boat to Buburimu Peninsula.${prompt}
  15715: |-
    I'm actually quite fed up with these ridiculous baubles, but I'm not one for losing face.
    If you should see ${entity: 0} again, please give my regards and say I found the gift rather...quaint.${prompt}
  15716: 'What''s this? A present addressed to me from ${entity: 0}?${prompt}'
  15717: How unexpectedly charming and thoughtful. This has certainly brightened what was about to be a gloomy Starlight Celebration.${prompt}
  15718: |-
    Would you be so kind as to tell ${entity: 0} that I truly appreciate the gift?
    I am also thoroughly impressed with your selfless nature, adventurer.${prompt}
  15719: 'Could it be...? Indeed, it is benevolence manifest, emanating from the humble home of one ${entity: 0}?${prompt}'
  15720: |-
    What a decidedly pleasant surprise. I am simply beside myself with an unbridled, childish glee that has not washed over me in ever so long.
    I swear that I am on the brink of giggling like I used to when I was still knee-high to a Taru.${prompt}
  15721: 'The finite words of us mere mortals may not be sufficient to convey the depths of my gratitude, but I earnestly hope ${entity: 0} would appreciate a succinct “Thank you.”${prompt}'
  15722: 'A present from...${entity: 0}? This isn''t one of those tricky-wicky flimflams, is it?${prompt}'
  15723: |-
    Of course I'll take it! I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, even if it's from my mortaru enemy!
    Maybe ${entity: 0} has turned over a new leaf since we last met...${prompt}
  15724: Well then, I suppose some thanks are in order. But if I find out that this was just some elaborataru scheme to make me lower my guard, I'm going to boppy-wop you both in the noggin!${prompt}
  15725: |-
    Oooh, a gift from ${entity: 0}?
    What jolly-wolly tidings you've brought, adventurer.${prompt}
  15726: |-
    I wonder what's inside... Could it be a scrum-diddly-umptious cake?
    But I've already gotten so roly-poly during the holiday season! Maybe I should just send it back! ${prompt}
  15727: |-
    No, thataru wouldn't be right. Besides, it might not be edible.
    Anyway, please be sure to thank ${entity: 0} for pudding the icing on such a delectable Starcake Chocolation.
    Ugh, I'm just terrible!${prompt}
  15728: 'Why would ${entity: 0} be sending me a gift? It''s not like there''s anything special going on.${prompt}'
  15729: |-
    The Starlight Celebration, you say? So that explains the light shows and festive atmosphere around here lately.
    My head just hasn't been the same since I fell off that chocobo last month.${prompt}
  15730: |-
    I best start looking for something to give in return. In the meantime, please tell ${entity: 0} how happy I am to have received this.
    And maybe next year I'll remember before it's too late. <Sigh>...One can only hope.${prompt}
  15731: "A present for me? \nI'm a lone lioness, and I don't need to share my kills with anyone!${prompt}"
  15732: 'What? ${entity: 0} wanted me to have this? Well, I guess I could take it...${prompt}'
  15733: |-
    Don't get the wrrrong idea! It's not like I enjoy the gift or anything!
    Just run back to ${entity: 0} and drop dead! This conversation never happened!${prompt}

    Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul.
    Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.${prompt}
  15765: By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.${prompt}
  15766: 'At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}'
  15767: Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.${prompt}
  15768: That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.${prompt}
  15769: From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.${prompt}
  15770: But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.${prompt}
  15771: The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt}
  15772: |-
    Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all.
    As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.${prompt}
  15773: We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.${prompt}
  15774: 'Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level ${number: 0}. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.${prompt}'
  15775: |-
    Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands.

  16582: In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning adventurers to lend their aid.${prompt}

  16584: In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning soldiers of the Allied Forces to lend their aid.${prompt}
  16585: To be sure, there're those who question the wisdom of thinning our ranks in the face of the Shadow Lord's armies. But I assure you, friend, the Voidwalker threat is no less real.${prompt}

  16587: Armed with this information, we dispatch strike teams to preemptively neutralize the threat.${prompt}

    These magicked stones are distributed in regular shipments from our Jeuno-based research team.
    They're the bare minimum we need to have a fighting chance against the enemy.${prompt}

  16593: The Voidwatch is an organization that exists for the sole purpose of protecting the world from extradimensional invaders we call “Voidwalkers.”${prompt}
  16594: Recognizing the graveness of this threat, the nations of the Middle Lands joined together in common cause and formed the Voidwatch.${prompt}
  16595: Helming the organization is the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, with the remaining three nations contributing resources for its operation.${prompt}
  16596: 'Possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt}'
  16597: It can be earned only through loyal service to your nation, and thus serves as a testimonial for your prowess.${prompt}

  16599: Affiliation with the Allied Forces of Altana is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt}

  16601: The enlistment procedure varies depending on nation. Those wishing to obtain a recommendation letter should pay visit to one of the military encampments surrounding Jeuno.${prompt}
  16602: When you battle a Voidwalker, you must do so as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of the dimension who has harnessed the powers of the voidstone and stratum abyssite.${prompt}
  16603: Bereft of these two objects, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.${prompt}
  16604: However, there are a few points all budding Voidwatchers should bear in mind.${prompt}
  16605: Most crucial of all, the extradimensional nature of being a Voidwatcher renders you isolated and unable to receive help from the outside world.${prompt}
  16606: Scientists attribute this to the dimensional misalignment that occurs. As people are ordinarily unable to see Voidwalkers, so too are they unable to see you.${prompt}
  16607: But you needn't concern yourself with the hows and whys of such matters. It would behoove you far more to become familiar with the workings of the “existential spectrum.”${prompt}
  16608: |-
    You see, each dimension is composed of an existential spectrum to which all things within are aligned.
    In turn, the spectrum is formed of five lights: blue, red, yellow, green, and white.${prompt}
  16609: The alignment of these lights between Voidwalker and Voidwatcher plays an important role in our efforts.${prompt}
  16610: To elaborate, the act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning ourselves to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  16611: Now, while Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with these creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  16612: Compensating measures, however, have been developed to allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe.${prompt}
  16613: One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items,” while another entails performing certain actions against the enemy.${prompt}
  16614: Both methods aim to manipulate the alignment value of individual lights to various ends.${prompt}
  16615: All five lights influence the contents of the treasure chest which appears at the successful end of battle.${prompt}
  16616: Our researchers have succeeded in determining what manner of benefits are associated with each light.${prompt}
  16617: For instance, improving blue spectral alignment is known to produce greater quantities of spoils.${prompt}
  16618: In contrast, manipulating red spectral alignment reportedly enhances the quality of individual items--potions becoming hi-potions, and so forth.${prompt}
  16619: Yellow and green, on the other hand, influence experience gain and cruor yield respectively.${prompt}
  16620: If you wish to know more about the curious red substance we call cruor, you need but ask.${prompt}
  16621: |-
    Lastly, we have white spectral alignment, which is unique even in this company.
    It has been determined to affect the appearance of transdimensional objects such as atmacite and periapt.${prompt}
  16622: Research regarding these artifacts is still ongoing.${prompt}
  16623: Lastly, be reassured that there're no known negative effects of manipulating spectral alignment. We unreservedly encourage all Voidwatch operatives to endeavor towards maximum alignment.${prompt}
  16624: Ascent items are unique objects that can be used to manipulate the spectral alignment of corresponding lights in the existential spectrum.${prompt}
  16625: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are representative of such items.
    They're the pride and joy of our Jeuno-based research team, who'd have folk believe they're the greatest inventions since airships.${prompt}
  16626: (Just between you and me, though, it is Far Eastern scientists that pioneered the technology they're based upon.)${prompt}
  16627: They're not the only means by which we manipulate spectral alignment, mind you. Similar results can be achieved by performing specific actions against the enemy.${prompt}
  16628: Truth be told, much is still shrouded in mystery. What actions will produce the desired effect is something you will have to discover for yourself through trial and error.${prompt}
  16629: Defeating a Voidwalker will cause a mysterious pyxis to emerge at the selfsame planar rift whence the creature was felled.${prompt}
  16630: 'Such riftworn pyxides exhibit a most peculiar characteristic: the content they bear reportedly changes depending on who glimpses within.${prompt}'
  16631: |-
    Our scientists conjecture that this is due to some trick of spectral alignment. As with numerous other mysteries surrounding Voidwalkers, however, I highly doubt they have even an inkling of understanding.
    But I digress...${prompt}
  16632: Only one combatant need possess a voidstone for all party or alliance members to do battle with a Voidwalker. Of the other squad members only stratum abyssite is required.${prompt}
  16633: |-
    As always seems to be the case, however, there is a catch.
    Pyxides have been observed to yield less spoils for combatants without a voidstone of their own.${prompt}
  16634: It scarce needs be said, but it would be to your benefit to have both the aforementioned items readied before taking on a Voidwalker.${prompt}
  16635: |-
    Lastly, a warning: pyxides will eventually vanish if left untouched overlong.
    Our scientists have put forth the theory of normalizing spatial dissonance, but you needn't concern yourself with their mumbo-jumbo.${prompt}
  16636: Just see to it that your hard-earned spoils are claimed in good time, and things will be rosy for all involved.${prompt}
  16637: 'The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is a magicked object produced by the Voidwatch''s Jeuno-based research wing.${prompt}'
  16638: Its innocuous appearance belies the immense power it holds...the power to render Voidwalkers visible to its bearer.${prompt}
  16639: The stone achieves this feat by realigning our existential spectrum to that of the creature.${prompt}
  16640: I shall explain the process in layman's terms for your benefit. No need to thank me--I merely perform my duty.${prompt}
  16641: I want you to visualize two canvases, each the same distance from the other. Yes, as two separate objects are normally wont to be.${prompt}
  16642: Imagine you and I standing on one of the canvases--what else does one do with a canvas but stand on it, yes?${prompt}
  16643: Now, imagine Voidwalkers standing on the other canvas, doing whatever it is Voidwalkers do. Destroying things and behaving with utter impropriety, no doubt.${prompt}
  16644: |-
    Being on two different canvases, it follows that we cannot touch the Voidwalkers, let alone see them.
    Actually, that doesn't explain why we can't see the Voidwalkers...unless it's a magical canvas they're on that makes all things upon it invisible! Yes, that'll serve!${prompt}
  16645: And this brings us full circle back to the voidstone. I want you to think of it as a magical paintbrush that we use to...grapple ourselves over to the Voidwalkers' canvas. Thence the fighting begins.${prompt}
  16646: |-
    I trust you now have a rudimentary understanding of the process. That's all you need, really.
    Leave the fractal geometry to the fractal geometrists, I always say.${prompt}
  16647: |-
    As long as you remember the canvas and the paintbrush--that's the voidstone--you cannot go astray.
    Now, to apprise you of more practical matters...${prompt}
  16648: Twenty hours (Earth time) is required to produce a stone and imbue it with the necessary magicks, although word is that this may be shortened as research progresses.${prompt}
  16649: |-
    Mind you, this isn't the only variety of stone you'll be needing.
    There exists another: stratum abyssite.${prompt}
  16650: |-
    Whereas the voidstone serves as a power source, acting as a compass for channeling that power is stratum abyssite.
    Only by using the two in conjunction can we achieve our objectives.${prompt}
  16651: |-
    Are you familiar with ${color: 5}voiddust${color: 1}?
    Put simply, it is a granular substance from which voidstones may be fabricated.${prompt}
  16652: |-
    As I explained, significant time is required to produce a voidstone from scratch.
    Provide me with voiddust, however, and I can fashion a stone for you in short order.${prompt}
  16653: |-
    The same comrades of ours who stock ascent items may also furnish you with voiddust.
    Why do they not fabricate the stones themselves, or deliver the dust directly to me?
    Shush! The Voidwatch works in mysterious ways, and it would behoove you to inquire no further.${prompt}
  16654: |-
    At any rate, should you manage to obtain any ${color: 5}voiddust${color: 1} in your travels, you need only return here and trade it to me.
    Simple enough, wouldn't you say?${prompt}
  16655: Furthermore, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.${prompt}
  16656: Based on the evolutionary state of your stratum abyssite, the Voidwatch will direct you to a suitable operation area.${prompt}
  16657: If you wish to have your stone analyzed, simply present it to an atma refiner.${prompt}
  16658: |-
    Planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space--have manifested across the land.
    The Voidwalker hordes roam beyond, unchecked and ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt}
  16659: By invoking the power of stratum abyssite, it is possible to battle the fell creatures as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of our dimension.${prompt}
  16660: Those also possessed of a voidstone will find their Voidwatcher experience greatly enhanced.${prompt}
  16661: Alone, however, stratum abyssite serves no purpose; only when used in conjunction with a voidstone can its powers be unleashed.${prompt}
  16662: Hence, at least one member of your squad--be it party or alliance--must possess a voidstone in order to arrange a confrontation with a Voidwalker.${prompt}
  16663: Keep this fact in mind at all times.${prompt}
  16664: It is not known when the planar rifts first manifested. Some say they've always been there, while others claim recent events have triggered their appearance.${prompt}
  16665: If only we could return to the past, perhaps we could shed some light upon this mystery...${prompt}
  16666: Obtainable by defeating Voidwalkers, cruor is an energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt}
  16667: While appearing to be some manner of mineral, detailed analysis has revealed that cruor is in fact organic.${prompt}
  16668: |-
    As far as our researchers can tell, however, it's inanimate like most well-behaved plants.
    There's no fear of cruor suddenly springing to life in your palms.${prompt}
  16669: Being supremely pleasing to the eyes, cruor might have adorned the display cases of many a jewelry shop during peacetime. Unfortunately, the age demands that its unique properties be put to more practical uses.${prompt}
  16670: |-
    Namely, the infusion and enrichment of atmacite.
    If you wish to learn about these two processes, you need but ask an atmacite refiner, our experts on such matters.${prompt}
  16671: As cruor is a vital aspect of our operations, the Voidwatch is always looking to procure more. Should you have any excess cruor, we would be glad to take it off your hands and offer you useful items in exchange.${prompt}
  16672: Abyssite is the name given to a mysterious stone that assumes various forms and colors, the roles they serve likewise manifold in nature.${prompt}
  16673: Of the copious varieties thus far discovered, there exist those called “periapt”--lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt}
  16674: Defeating a Voidwalker is known to yield periapt on very rare occasions. Serve the Voidwatch earnestly, however, and you will surely have one to call your own.${prompt}

  17017: Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.${prompt}
  17018: Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.${prompt}
  17019: “Unity” is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.${prompt}
  17020: Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.${prompt}
  17021: 'Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as “${keyitem-plural: 1[2]}.”${prompt}'
  17022: Chat settings may be changed by selecting “Status” from the main menu, and choosing “Unity Info” under the “Unity” submenu.${prompt}
  17023: You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.${prompt}
  17024: Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.${prompt}
  17025: The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.${prompt}
  17026: Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).${prompt}
  17027: Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.${prompt}
  17028: “Wanted” objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.${prompt}
  17029: These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as “Unity accolades” to undertake.${prompt}
  17030: Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.${prompt}
  17031: Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.${prompt}
  17032: The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.${prompt}
  17033: A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.${prompt}
  17034: Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.${prompt}
  17035: Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.${prompt}
  17036: When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.${prompt}
  17037: Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  17038: No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.${prompt}
  17039: You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.${prompt}
  17040: An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.${prompt}
  17041: One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.${prompt}
  17042: A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.${prompt}
  17043: You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.${prompt}
  17044: Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.${prompt}
  17045: Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.${prompt}
  17046: Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.${prompt}
  17047: The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.${prompt}
  17048: It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.${prompt}
  17049: The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.${prompt}
  17050: Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  17051: These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.${prompt}
  17052: Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.${prompt}
  17053: 'Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of ${number: 0} accolades per week (Earth time).${prompt}'
  17054: You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.${prompt}
  17055: This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.${prompt}
  17056: This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.${prompt}
  17057: However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.${prompt}
  17058: Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.${prompt}
  17059: The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.${prompt}
  17060: Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.${prompt}
  17061: Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.${prompt}
  17062: On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.${prompt}
  17063: 'Additionally, an individual''s evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by ${number: 0}. A Unity''s ranking is the average of all eligible members'' individual evaluations.${prompt}'
  17064: The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.${prompt}
  17065: Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.${prompt}
  17066: 'Those with evaluations of ${number: 0} or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.${prompt}'
  17067: Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.${prompt}
  17068: A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.${prompt}
  17069: Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.${prompt}
  17070: A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.${prompt}
  17071: It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.${prompt}
  17072: Those desiring to participate should seek out one of the initiative's representatives, dressed in green, in one of the three nations.${prompt}
  17073: '${color-alt: 138}You are currently under Unity restriction. Please try again during the next tabulation period.'

  17120: 'All entrants are tasked with putting together the most lavish outfits they can find and strutting their stuff for the judge--namely, me. Points are awarded for the following types of equipment: main weapon, sub weapon, head, body, hands, legs, and feet.${prompt}'
  17121: We're an equal opportunity contest, so don't think you'll be impressing anyone here with your Gjallarhorns or Idrises! Only rewards gleaned from special events are counted.${prompt}

  17372: Hello there. I suppose you're here to upgrade your shield, yes? I've already heard all aboutaru it.${prompt}
  17373: The first thing is to teach you the recipe. Try not to forgetaru it, okay?${prompt}
  17374: This is much differentaru than the recipes I'm used to.${prompt}
  17375: 'At any rate, I need to tell you how to obtain the listaru of ingredients. The first one is the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  17376: 'Last time, you used the aspis to increase the Craftsmanship. Basically, you need to do the same thing again to craftaru items while the ${item-singular: 0[2]} is equipped.${prompt}'
  17377: It seems that it will take longer to boostaru the Craftsmanship this time around. As such, you'll need to have patience.${prompt}
  17378: 'Bring me the shield once it reaches 100% and I''ll use my expertaru skills to create the ${item-singular: 1[2]} for you.${prompt}'
  17379: 'The next ingredientaru you''ll require is the ${item-singular: 2[2]}. I''ve given it and the ${item-singular: 3[2]} that you used last time to Isanie.${prompt}'
  17380: 'The lastaru ingredient you''ll need is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}. I''ve teamed up with the A.M.A.N. to create some Records of Eminence objectives for you.${prompt}'
  17381: 'Check the Records of Eminence menu to find out the extentaru of the objectives. Once you''ve completed them all, you''ll receive the ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt}'
  17382: That's it for the ingredients! Think you can handle it? I'm confidentaru that you have what it takes to succeed.${prompt}
  17383: Well, let's see what you've got there.${prompt}
  17384: 'Yes! This''ll do just fine! Here, let me get a startaru on that ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt}'
  17385: Okay, it's all finished. Tell me, whataru do you think?${prompt}
  17386: 'Hmm... It looks like creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]} has caused its Craftsmanship to revertaru downwards again.${prompt}'
  17387: 'Remember, if you lose the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you''ll need to boostaru the shield''s Craftsmanship again. Do be careful with it.${prompt}'
  17388: Oh... I thoughtaru it would look like a frying pan, but it's more of a cutting board I suppose. Yes, of course I know it's a shield!${prompt}
  17389: Although, I can feel that its power is well beyond that of the lastaru shield. Yes, this one is destined to become quite formidable!${prompt}
  17390: Here, allow me to mark it for you before I forgetaru.${prompt}
  17391: There we go. Now, justaru take it to Mewk Chorosap and your task will be complete.${prompt}
  17392: Hmm... You must complete this final objective or your task will be an abjectaru failure. Go and give it another try.${prompt}
  17393: Hm? It's that frying pan...oh, I mean shield, again! Now, let's get you that recipe-wecipe.${prompt}
  17394: Oh, you already know the recipe. So I suppose you need to know how to obtain what's on the ingredients listaru.${prompt}
  17395: 'The ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}... Okay, listen carefully-warefully.${prompt}'
  17396: You see, the Culinarians' Guild has received quite a few delivery orders for our delicious-welicious food. We could really use your help.${prompt}
  17397: However, this is a little differentaru than our usual deliveries. Food is always best when cooked fresh, so you need to make it in front of the customer.${prompt}
  17398: Of course, I would demand the same treatmentaru myself. So basically, anything made elsewhere will not be accepted.${prompt}
  17399: 'Once you have delivered all of the food, I can give you the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]} you''re looking-wooking for.${prompt}'
  17400: 'Okay, this is the ${choice: 0}[first/next/final] request.${prompt}'

    I'll do my best.
    I've had enough.${prompt}
  17412: Is that so... Well, if you're not feeling up to it, it's a disservice to our customers-wustomers. I'll ask another craftsman for help.${prompt}
  17413: Take a momentaru to refresh yourself and come back for another request after you're feeling better.${prompt}
  17414: So, are you feeling-weeling any better now? If so, let's get on to the next request.${prompt}
  17415: Welcome back. It seems you took care of that requestaru for me. I'm sure the customer is quite pleased.${prompt}
  17416: Excellentaru work! You've completed all of the requests. I bet it's the most satisfied customer ever!${prompt}
  17417: 'Here you go. I presentaru you with the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  17418: Also, if you ever need more of them, you can make a trade using guild points.${prompt}
  17419: Lately, I've been wondering what it'd be like to boil-woil or grill this thing... Would it taste any good?${prompt}
  17420: Did it finally turn into a frying pan this time around? I think that'd be a simply perfect resultaru.${prompt}
  17421: Oh, it's justaru a shield. Although, I can vouch for just how amazing both it and you are!${prompt}
  17422: Our friend seems to think that the nextaru upgrade will unlock the shield's ultimate power. I can't wait to see it for myself.${prompt}
  17423: Oh, wait just a momentaru. I have a new crafting technique that I think you'd do quite well with. I can't wait to see what you cook up with it!${prompt}
  17424: I thoughtaru you'd be coming around here! The shield has almost reached its final form!${prompt}
  17425: Allow me to teach-weach you how to obtain the necessary ingredients.${prompt}
  17426: 'First, there''s the ${item-singular: 2[2]} and the ${item-singular: 3[2]}.${prompt}'
  17427: You can get them from Isanie by trading crafter points for them. I have a feeling-weeling you already knew that, though.${prompt}
  17428: 'Next is the ${item-singular: 1[2]}. It''s the same procedure you''ve used before. Visitaru me after you raise your shield''s Craftsmanship to 100%.${prompt}'
  17429: That's it for how to obtain the materials! I suppose you should get started by giving your Craftsmanship rating a boostaru!${prompt}
  17430: 'Here''s the ${item-singular: 0[2]} as per the instructions I received. I heard that Mewk Chorosap wants it delivered to her. If possible-wossible, can you take it there for me?${prompt}'
  17431: How're things?${prompt}
  17432: Hmm... That was a request by a Tarutaru girl from Adoulin. I remember-wember it because that was the first time that somebody had ordered something other than food from us.${prompt}
  17433: Unfortunately, you're too late. She asked me to send it to Jeuno, so that's justaru what I did.${prompt}
  17434: I imagine it has already been delivered to Mewk Chorosap in Port Jeuno by now. You should go and take a look.${prompt}
  17435: Ahh, welcome! Take a look at this delicious looking bread on this emblem-wemblem. I made it the other day. For some reason, it was being used as a pot lid...${prompt}
  17436: Hm? You need it for something-womething? Sure, feel free to take it then!${prompt}

  17467: Happy 20th Vana'versary!${prompt}
  17468: I hope you ready to play Mandragora Mania Madness!${prompt}
  17469: Since this new game, would you like to check rules in manual?${prompt}
  17470: |-
    Read the manual?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure.
    No thanks.${prompt}
  17471: Mandragora Mania Madness is a game in which players battle by placing different colored game pieces on a 4x4 playing area.${prompt}
  17472: You use the white pieces (mandragoras), while your opponent uses the black pieces (corrigans).${prompt}
  17473: The player to go first is determined randomly when the game begins. You will be able to adjust these settings yourself from the second game onward.${prompt}
  17474: The first player to place four pieces so they align in a row will be declared the winner.${prompt}
  17475: However, you will automatically be disqualified if you ever place three of your pieces in a row, so be mindful of your moves at all times.${prompt}
  17476: Note that if you place your game pieces so that you have both three and four pieces in a row, the row with four pieces will take precedence and you will win the game.${prompt}
  17477: If you place a game piece on either side of your opponent's piece, you will convert it into one of your pieces.${prompt}
  17478: You can play anywhere from three to five games, and the first player to win three games is the winner.${prompt}
  17479: Now, for an explanation on points.${prompt}
  17480: |-
    You receive points after the completion of each game.
    The points are tallied using units known as mandy.${prompt}
  17481: |-
    If you win the game, you will receive a number of points equal to the number of game pieces you have on the board.
    In the example shown, you will earn 8 mandy.${prompt}
  17482: Even if you lose the game, you will receive a number of points equal to half the number of your game pieces on the board (rounded off to avoid fractions).${prompt}
  17483: The first player to win three games gets to keep all of the points they have earned, although you won't get any points if you quit partway.${prompt}
  17484: Occasionally, you might get to play a bonus game, where your pieces are pink (adenium) or feature a watermelon pattern (citrullus).${prompt}
  17485: 'They are worth ${number: 0}x and ${number: 1}x the points, respectively, giving you the chance to quickly score a large number of points.${prompt}'
  17486: The key to victory is to not just try and place four pieces in a row, but to position your pieces in a way that forces your opponent to place three pieces in a row.${prompt}
  17487: See? Is very easy! Ready to give try?${prompt}
  17488: You get mandy if you win or lose, but not if you quit partway!${prompt}
  17489: Can trade mandy for many goodies.${prompt}
  17490: Then I just give one piece of advice.${prompt}
  17491: You get mandy if you win or lose, but not if you quit partway!${prompt}
  17492: You can look at manual later if you need reminder on how to play.${prompt}

  17549: And the one they have in their clutches is the most fearsome of all...the homunculus created by the Maelstrom Mage, Garazu-Horeizu.${prompt}
  17550: |-
    Inquire about what?
    ${selection-lines}
    Who is Garazu-Horeizu?
    What did he do?
    What happened to him?${prompt}
  17551: Garazu-Horeizu is perhaps the most feared-weared mage in all Windurst's long history. Over 300 years ago, he brought all of Windurst to heel with his foul machinations.${prompt}
  17552: It is not unheard of for power-hungry sorcerers to trample over anyone who would stand in the way of their quest to become ever stronger-wonger.${prompt}
  17553: But Garazu-Horeizu was a fiend among fiends. He employed powerful hypnosis magic, also known as “the maelstrom”--hence his moniker-woniker.${prompt}
  17554: Garazu-Horeizu was brazen in his lustaru for power.${prompt}
  17555: He would conjure calamity upon all who dared defy him, and not even the words of the Star Sibyl could reach his blackened heart.${prompt}
  17556: He turned his back on his fellow Windurstians, conniving with the Yagudo to bring ruin upon us all.${prompt}
  17557: The ensuing conflict came to be known as the Fourth Yagudo War.${prompt}
  17558: Two students--the siblings Gurebu-Ogurebu and Medada--managed to projectaru a false image to throw the Yagudo forces into chaos, sending them scattered to the four winds...${prompt}
  17559: '...but the more one examines Garazu-Horeizu, the more shiver-wivers get sent up one''s spine.${prompt}'
  17560: Records state that Garazu-Horeizu fell in the Fourth Yagudo War.${prompt}
  17561: Perhaps the most perplexing part of his death-weath was the presence of a demon--a being thought at the time to be mere legend.${prompt}
  17562: It was believed that demons only appeared during the midst of world-changing conflicts, and their mere existence was thoughtaru to be a fairy tale by many.${prompt}
  17563: I suppose this apocryphal tale must be taken with a grain of saltaru, but Karaha-Baruha certainly seemed to place some stock in it.${prompt}
  17564: Garazu-Horeizu had been studying the prime avatars...so who can say what his true goal was. Hrmmm...${prompt}
  17565: Hrmmm!
  17566: And now that I've shared this tale with you, I have a requestaru--help us get back Garazu-Horeizu's homunculus.${prompt}
  17567: It would be cause for concern even if the creation contained only a fragmentaru of his power, but I fear it contains his profane nature as well.${prompt}
  17568: Yagudo keep all their most prized possessions deep within a vault in Giddeus. You may be able-wable to lay claim to your quarry there, if you hurry.${prompt}
  17569: Please make haste--and do be discreet about it.${prompt}
  17570: Adventurer, we must reclaim possession of Garazu-Horeizu's homunculus with all due haste.${prompt}
  17571: Yagudo keep all thier most prized possessions deep within a vault in Giddeus. You may be able-wable to lay claim to your quarry there, if you hurry.${prompt}
  17572: We cannot wait for the five ministries to convene and make an official decision. Please make haste--and do be discreet about it.${prompt}
  17573: Hrm. Is that the Maelstrom Mage's magicked-wagicked homunculus?${prompt}
  17574: Hrmmm!? It's not?${prompt}
  17575: I see. So your operation in Giddeus didn't quite go to plan.${prompt}
  17576: My nextaru step is to figure out how to break the news to the other ministers in Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  17577: Who knows what the Yagudo have planned for that foul thing!?${prompt}
  17578: And they're planning on trading it to a rich Tarutaru in Windurst for some silly bauble?${prompt}
  17579: 'There''s only one merchant sufficiently lavish and malicious to barter-warter with them: Honoi-Gomoi in Windurst Waters.${prompt}'
  17580: Why, he is a descendant of Garezu-Horeizu, after all. He must be planning-wanning to utilize the homunculus to engage in perfidy.${prompt}
  17581: |-
    Hrm. Hrmmm.
    Hrmmmmmm!${prompt}
  17582: Maybe you've heard the tale of the magicked doll already?${prompt}
  17583: It's not a legend I dare shout from the rooftops. In fact, I wish I could forget it...${prompt}
  17584: But according to the story-wory, when the doll is manipulated using forbidden Manustery techniques...${prompt}
  17585: '...the vengeful spirit of Garezu-Horeizu can be summoned back from Death''s dark hall.${prompt}'
  17586: Could Honoi-Gomoi be aware of the legends of the dolls?${prompt}
  17587: |-
    No. There is no way he could...
    Even if he did, would he know the Manustery rites to...${prompt}
  17588: According to the tale, the spiritaru of Garezu-Horeizu can be summoned back from Death's dark hall.${prompt}
  17589: But it would take a mage of near-unfathomable power to complete the incantation.${prompt}
  17590: And for all his bluster, Honoi-Gomoi is just a layman. He would be unable to do anything by himself.${prompt}
  17591: Hrm. Hrmmmmmm!${prompt}
  17592: Although we have not yet gotten the cursed trinketaru back, I must commend you on having unraveled part of this infernal tapestry. Here's a token of my appreciation--and please forget everything we discussed today.${prompt}
  17593: Including about that egg business-wusiness. Not that I could help you even if i wanted to.${prompt}
  17594: |-
    Hrm!
    I told you to forget about the whole thing but...about the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}...${prompt}
  17595: Something aboutaru it seems familiar. Yes, I can picture a small Tarutaru playing like it was only yesterday...${prompt}
  17596: Ah, adventurer! I think I know the children who were playing with the doll. Could you bring it to them?${prompt}
  17597: |-
    Deliver the doll?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure.
    No thanks.${prompt}
  17598: Those children are always spotted near a warehouse by the wharf.${prompt}
  17599: I don't think you'll receive-weive any compensation, but kindness is its own reward.${prompt}
  17600: This place is a library, officially known as the Federal Book Repository for Magical Knowledge and Research and Book Repository of General Knowledges.${prompt}
  17601: We have no use here for smelly, obnoxious-woxious children's toys.${prompt}
  17602: |-
    Hrm....
    Please don't go around telling everyone about something being stolen from the Doll Chamber.${prompt}
  17603: I shall leave you here, for preparations to meet with the other ministers must be made.${prompt}
