  7939: (Well pleased am I with your dedication. Entrusting the blueprints to you was a decision most wise.)${prompt}
  7940: (Twenty year pass already? Me very enjoy work, so no feel like twenty year!)${prompt}
  7941: (Gahaha! Dependable as ever, I see! Now, tell me. Is it operational?)${prompt}
  7942: (Right now me inject magic, Master Zogbog. It be ready soon.)${prompt}
  7943: (Ah! Me want to show Master Zogbog something else. This way please come.)${prompt}
  7944: <Gasp>!${prompt}
  7945: (D-do my eyes play at mischief? Dare I hope that before me stands a mighty legion, ready to carry out my bidding?)${prompt}
  7946: (You like, Master Zogbog? Me already finish inject magic, so they ready to move.)${prompt}
  7947: (B-beyond my wildest dreams! With these miracles of science at my disposal, history shall be at my mercy!)${prompt}
  7948: Gahahaha...${prompt}
  7949: Gwahahahahaha!!!${prompt}
  7950: '...And that concludes my report.${prompt}'
  7951: Wait! You mentioned seeing an Elvaan child being held captive...${prompt}
  7952: Tell me what he looked like!${prompt}
  7953: |-
    Regrettably, the dimness revealed little to me of the lad's appearance.
    I did, however, take note of the sword which lay at his side.${prompt}
  7954: '''Twas a finely forged blade of fiery red steel, doubtless worth good coin. I suspect the lad is highborn.${prompt}'
  7955: A friend of yours, I gather? Would that I could've extracted the lad, but the Orcs standing sentry made the task quite impossible.${prompt}
  7956: ${name-player}, the fault is mine that he's been taken! We must rescue him!${prompt}
  7957: I've not given you leave, boy! Your training isn't complete!${prompt}
  7958: |-
    Curses! He stands not a chance on his own.
    Lharant, take word to Bostillette. We shall precede the main force in infiltrating the enemy's lair.${prompt}
  7959: S-surely you jest!? You're but a few, and the statues are powerful and many!${prompt}
  7960: |-
    There's no helping it. Insolent as he may be, we cannot stand idly by while the boy rushes headlong into grave peril.
    Now go, Lharant!${prompt}
  7961: |-
    Very well, sir. Before I leave, I would give you this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.
    It should allow you to escape the enemy's notice when you steal into the caverns.${prompt}
  7962: '''Tis designed for single use, but spares can be obtained from the covert communications chest should the need arise.${prompt}'
  7963: Please take all care, sir. I shall fly like the wind back to base camp.${prompt}
  7964: (What? An Elvaan child on the loose, causing mayhem in Ghelsba, you say?)${prompt}
  7965: (Excenmille, I'll wager...)${prompt}
  7966: (Mekglok, ready the statues for immediate deployment.)${prompt}
  7967: (If you mean small one, they already ready, Master Zogbog.)${prompt}
  7968: (No. Not only those.)${prompt}
  7969: (I would see the crowning glory of my legion christened in battle.)${prompt}
  7970: (Huh? M-Master Zogbog, me not finish inject magic into big one. And many trial to run--)${prompt}
  7971: (The enemy is but one scrawny Elvaan boy...plus what other vermin crawls out of the woodwork.)${prompt}
  7972: (This shall serve perfectly as the final test run before I send forth my legion to conquer the past!)${prompt}
  7973: (B-but Master Zogbog...)${prompt}
  7974: (Enough! You will do as I say!)${prompt}
  7975: (Y-yes, Master Zogbog.)${prompt}
  7976: (Gahaha... The moment of our showdown is come, Excenmille.)${prompt}
  7977: (By the honor of my fallen clan, I swear I shall have satisfaction of you this day!)${prompt}
  7978: Uwaaah! I...I'm going to be dealt a d-d-dreadful death, kupo!${prompt}
  7979: Look, I'm keeping the creature provoked, so there's nothing to be afraid of. You can stop hiding in mommy's skirt now.${prompt}
  7980: Uwaaah! A monstrous moogle-eating mommy lizard! Don't let it n-n-near me, kupo!${prompt}
  7981: |-
    A monstrous moogle-eating...what? Are you even listening to me?
    Nothing's going to hurt you, so get a grip already!${prompt}
  7982: |-
    Uwaaah! Um...I mean, is that n-n-novennial attire you're sporting?
    It looks suitably swanky on you, k-k-kupo!${prompt}
  7983: '${color-alt: 15}${name-player} apprises the moogle of the material shortage.'
  7984: |-
    Uwaaah! I-I mean, oh dear, that's quite a p-p-pickle.
    But I'm not to blame. I would've made a d-d-dozen deliveries by now, weren't it for the repulsive reptiles raging for my moogle flesh, k-k-kupo.${prompt}
  7985: |-
    A moogle stricken with an unnatural fear of the very thing he hunts...
    Can it get any more absurd?${prompt}
  7986: H-hey, I'll have you know our duties were designated by a draw! I had no choice whatsoever in my posting, kupo!${prompt}
  7987: |-
    Adventurer, I must beg a b-b-boon of you.
    I need this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} delivered without delay to San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7988: |-
    Deliver the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?
    ${selection-lines}
    I shall.
    Um...${prompt}
  7989: |-
    My th-thanks, kupo! A more altruistic adventurer I've never known!
    Now, a moogle crafter awaits by the Tanners' Guild. Please see the skin s-s-safely to his hands.${prompt}
  7990: |-
    The adventurer's obviously busy.
    Instead of bothering ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], why don't I just take it?${prompt}
  7991: Uwaaah! You can't leave me to fend for myself, kupo! I won't last a minute on my own!${prompt}
  7992: |-
    <Sigh>... Even unreasonable fear has limits, you know.
    Look, friend. We could really do with the help. As a fellow adventurer, won't you reconsider?${prompt}
