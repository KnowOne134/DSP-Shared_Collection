  9986: I am Alfesar, a friar from the San d'Oria Cathedral. I have come to study the Altepa Desert and its surroundings.${prompt}
  9987: Until only recently, the monster-infested Korroloka Tunnel has been a barrier between the Quon continent and Zepwell Island. But with the clearing of that tunnel, I was able to make my way here.${prompt}
  9988: On your way here to Rabao, I'm sure you saw the ruins of ages past half-buried in the sand. I have been given the task of investigating those ruins.${prompt}
  9989: 'Several days ago, a researcher I hired brought back ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} inscribed with ancient writings. He found it in the expansive Quicksand Caves that lie beneath the Altepa Desert.${prompt}'
  9990: This was a major discovery. According to a scholar of ancient literature, the inscription on the tablet appears to be some kind of spell.${prompt}
  9991: Unfortunately, with an important part of the tablet broken away, we were unable to decipher the full meaning.${prompt}
  9992: I am still undergoing training and do not possess the ability to survive a foray into a place like the Quicksand Caves. And so, I turn to you.${prompt}
  9993: '${name-player}, you are highly regarded as an accomplished adventurer. I wish to employ you to venture into the Quicksand Caves and find the remaining ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  9994: I humbly beg this favor of you.${prompt}

  10004: Sometimes we gotta dump our goods and run like hell when we get attacked by monsters out there. Your life is the most valuable thing ya got, pal.${prompt}
  10005: Some of the more nasty critters out there are those huge scorpions. They gotta be more'n twice my height, and naturally the sting in the tail'll shoot ya full of poison.${prompt}
  10006: Those scorpions are a real pain in the backside, if ya get my meaning. It's fine if ya happen to be best friends with a white mage, but out here you'll find more bruisers than healers. If ya don't got a good stock of antidotes, you're a dead man.${prompt}
  10007: '''Course, the main ingredient for that antidote just happens to be ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'

    Well, sorry for taking up ya time.${prompt}
  10011: |-
    Thanks, pal, you're a lifesaver!
    Now get out there, whack some of them scorpions, and bring me ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. I'll have ya reward waiting for ya.${prompt}
  10012: |-
    Oh, you again.
    I won't bore ya with a long speech. If ya feel up to getting us some ${item-singular: 1[2]}, I'll be standing right here.${prompt}

  10017: |-
    What the hell is this!?
    I asked ya to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.
    Get ya head out of the sand. Ya won't be getting a reward until ya bring me what I asked for.${prompt}
  10018: |-
    Hold on a minute.
    You're carrying too much stuff. Go sell or drop the junk ya don't need, then bring me the thing I asked for.${prompt}

    Oh, you again.
    If ya come across any more ${item-plural: 1[2]}, bring 'em to me and I'll buy 'em off ya.${prompt}
  10020: After going through all the trouble of drawing up the water for the oasis, the pioneers of this place stocked it with fish. You can't argue with that kind of thoroughness, hehehe.${prompt}
  10021: "The Antica beastmen that make their homes here are covered in rigid plates. \nIt's like they're born with a natural suit of armor.${prompt}"
  10022: |-
    You won't be able to make a dent on them without a decent weapon.
    So saying, I still have to get a new sword, myself. Being a warrior can be so expensive...${prompt}
  10023: There's a cave system at the north edge of the Western Altepa Desert called the Kuftal Tunnel. Cape Teriggan lies at the other end of those caves.${prompt}
  10024: A few decades ago, you could easily travel from the cape further into the Quon continent. However, that path was lost when the land itself shifted during the Great War.${prompt}
  10025: |-
    Hey, did you know?
    The ruins that are buried beneath the desert in the Quicksand Caves were once a splendor-wendorous construction of the Galka.${prompt}
  10026: Long before either you or I were born, in an age when the Antica and the Galka waged war for dominance over the region, those buildings used to stand on the surface of the desert.${prompt}
  10027: |-
    And now they crumble below the shifting sands...
    Even as a Tarutaru, it gets me down. The home of an entire race, disappearing from the light of the sun...${prompt}
  10028: |-
    You see those windmills spinning atop the towers?
    They use the power of the wind to draw water up from deep beneath the earth.${prompt}
  10029: "Even during the dry months, Rabao never lacks for water. \nGetting the water up to the surface originally must have been quite a feat, though.${prompt}"
  10030: |-
    You should show your gratitude to the pioneers of this place.
    Why, my heart's about to burst from all the gratitude I'm feeling.
    Thank you, thank you, thank you...!${prompt}
  10031: From ages past, Zepwell Island has been treated as a forbidden land. The passages here from the mainland, the Gustav and Korroloka tunnels, have been inaccessible.${prompt}
  10032: But adventurers rarely heed words like “forbidden,” now do they? You seem like one of those types.${prompt}
  10033: A group of like-minded people, avoiding the authorities from their countries, made their way to this island. They set up shop here, using this oasis as a base.${prompt}
  10034: This is Rabao, a town founded by adventurers.${prompt}
  10035: |-
    Hail, fellow adventurer.
    My name is Maryoh-Comyujah.
    I braved the long, arrrduous journey from the mainland to search for trrreasure in the Quicksand Caves.${prompt}
  10036: |-
    It's been a little harrrder than I expected, though.
    The Quicksand Caves are extensive and verrry confusing.${prompt}
  10037: On top of that, there are all these ant-type beastmen crawling around down there. Not a nice place to be looking for lost rrriches!${prompt}
  10038: The rrroad to hidden trrreasure is long indeed...${prompt}
  10039: |-
    You probably weren't aware of it, but this island is the lost homeland of the Galka...
    Even in these endless sands, the joy of setting foot in your homeland is a difficult emotion to express.${prompt}
  10040: Behold! The sign upon this arch proclaims the existence of the auction house beyond. A bounty of food and supplies in the center of the desert! What more could one ask for in this life?${prompt}
  10041: A little further north of here is the Rabao oasis. It's not much, but there are goods for sale in the tents.${prompt}
  10042: Outside of Rabao, the desert stretches for as far as the eye can see. Rabao is the only place to gather supplies for your journey and acts as a waypoint for adventurers. It's important for us to work together out here.${prompt}
  10043: |-
    Welcome, adventurer.
    This is Rabao, a precious oasis in the middle of the vast Altepa Desert.
    Take the chance to revitalize yourself before continuing on your journey.${prompt}
  10044: When your pack is fit to burrrst, send your non-essential items to your delivery box and bam, prrroblem solved!${prompt}
  10045: We can deliver goods to your residence or to the residences of your friends.${prompt}
  10046: |-
    Welcome to Rabao.
    My name is Cavalgrinne, and I'm in charge of the auction house services.${prompt}
  10047: |-
    There are no set prices in the auction house.
    Don't forget to check the price history when you make a bid or put an item up for sale.${prompt}
  10048: |-
    Browsing the auction house is free!
    Checking the goods for sale every day can turn up some truly wondrous items.${prompt}
  10049: |-
    Well met, adventurer.
    If you're looking for a weapon to carve through those desert beasts, you've come to the right place.${prompt}
  10050: For rainy days and windy days, or for days when someone tries to thrust a spear in your guts, having a good set of armor can set your mind at ease.${prompt}
  10051: These days, you can get weapons and armor cheap at the auction houses. But magic is expensive no matter where you go.${prompt}
  10052: No problem, Scamplix not bad guy. Scamplix is good guy, sells stuff to adventurers. Scamplix got lots of good stuff for you.${prompt}

    Hmm. I'm guessing you haven't been taking on many requests from people.
    You know, if you keep that up, no one is going to remember you.${prompt}
  10064: Even doing small favors is fine at first. If you help out a lot of different people, you'll slowly gain their trust. Before you know it, everyone will know your name.${prompt}

    ...${name-player}?
    I think I have some vague memory of hearing that name somewhere... Nope, it's gone.${prompt}
  10066: But this just goes to show how few people know you around here. You've gotta put yourself out there more, my young adventurer friend.${prompt}
  10067: |-
    Hm? ${name-player}?
    I've heard that name before. Seems you're building yourself a good reputation.${prompt}

    Oh, it's ${name-player}.
    Your name comes up quite a lot in conversation these days.
    You must be keeping busy out there.${prompt}
  10072: Listening to the talk about you around the oasis just makes me swell up with pride. I know it's strange, but I love to hear about adventurers doing well in Rabao. Keep up the good work, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10073: |-
    Wow, ${name-player}!
    There's hardly a soul in all of Rabao who hasn't heard your name!
    I could hardly believe the stir you've been making.${prompt}

  10075: |-
    ${name-player}!
    Every time I speak with you, you seem to have gained in status. Pretty soon, I'm gonna have to start making appointments to talk to you!${prompt}

  10077: |-
    Greetings, ${name-player}.
    Your endeavors in neighboring countries have reached us here in Rabao, and the glory of your reputation precedes you.${prompt}
  10078: I feel honored to have known you before you became so famous. Good luck with your continuing adventurers!${prompt}
  10079: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}.
    I've known you since you were just starting out around here, but to think you would go on to achieve such glory...${prompt}

    In Rabao and beyond, your name is on everyone's lips.
    It wouldn't be going too far to say you've achieved the status of hero in my eyes.${prompt}
  10081: May the blessings of the Goddess Altana watch over your continuing endeavors.${prompt}
  10082: Owzie-wowzie! Don't make me talk. I hurt all over!${prompt}
  10083: Try though you may, there will come a time when failure is inevitable.${prompt}

  10086: Hey! You're that famous adventurer, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  10087: Yippee! This is my lucky day!${prompt}
  10088: Let me introduce myself. I am from the Rhinostery in Windurst. I do research on various living things.${prompt}
  10089: And I'm the besty-westy they've got! I've been looking into phenomena at a certain place.${prompt}
  10090: |-
    What phenomena, you ask? Well, there are these giant crystals, you see!
    And from those crystals, a strangey-wangey power is constantly pouring forth...${prompt}
  10091: "These crystals are found all over Vana'diel, and their energies affect the surrounding ecosystems. \nOur research team had been investigating the unusual emanations when...${prompt}"
  10092: Guess what!${prompt}
  10093: We finally succeeded in awakening the crystals!${prompt}
  10094: |-
    Our theory on what lay dormant inside the crystals was proven to be rightaru on the money!
    Except they didn't appreciate being woken up...
    We were attacked...
    We were bested-wested...${prompt}
  10095: |-
    Why do they so despise talking with us that they would rather fight?
    And what on Vana'diel would happen if someone were to defeat them?${prompt}
  10096: |-
    I bet you could do it!
    You call yourself an adventurer, right? Give it a shot!${prompt}
  10097: |-
    Take up the challenge?
    ${selection-lines}
    Bring it on!
    Ah, no, thanks...${prompt}
  10098: |-
    Great!
    Here, take this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}. But be warned--only a person who carries one can enter the crystal.${prompt}

    Without it, you won't be getting inside no matter how sneaky-weaky you are!
    Oh, and if you want to take some friends with you, they also have to get ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} from me. Okey-dokey?${prompt}
  10101: If you don't prepare yourself for battle, you'll get beaten to a pulp, like we did! ${prompt}

    Hmmm...
    Hrmmm...
    So it's time to use...no...${prompt}
  10155: |-
    Hello?
    You're an adventurer, right?
    Maybe you can help us out.${prompt}
  10156: Let me introduce myself and my companion. We're from the Rhinostery in Windurst.${prompt}
  10157: 'I was hired by the ministry to accompany this researcher to ${choice: 2}[Ifrit''s Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei''Yin/the Boyahda Tree] and assist him in his study of a series of giant crystals.${prompt}'
  10158: But what was waiting for us inside those crystals was more than I could deal with...${prompt}
  10159: |-
    We tried countless times, but I could not defeat that beast.
    Another researcher at the Rhinostery sympathized with our plight and developed an improved tuning fork.${prompt}
  10160: |-
    No no no no no!
    That crazy-wazy contraption won't provide us with any useful data!${prompt}
  10161: |-
    Listen, muscle-hussle brain.
    Science is not about winning or spinning, life or strife, even or Steven! It's a more delicate subjectaru!${prompt}
  10162: Do you see what I have to deal with? I don't know how much longer I can work with such a pessimist.${prompt}
  10163: |-
    That's where you come in.
    I was thinking of letting one of you adventurers test out the new fork and prove to my colleague that it is able to return data valuable to his research.${prompt}
  10164: |-
    No no no no no!
    Even if they use that half-rate spork, it'll take a tip-top summoner to defeat the prime avatar!${prompt}
  10165: |-
    Listen up.
    The fandangled ${item-singular: 1[2]} won't make it any easier for you to downright defeat the monster inside the crystal. Sure, it'll lower the power of the prime avatar to around ${number: 3}, but it will do the same to you! And on top of that, you'll only be able to summon that itty-bitty blue bugger, Carbuncle!${prompt}
  10166: And to make things worse, nobody-buddy else can enter the crystal with you! You'll be battling one-on-one, man-to-man, Taru-et-Taru!${prompt}
  10167: |-
    ...
    Yes, but sir... The Rhinostery has been pressing us to produce results. If we do not take some sort of action quickly...${prompt}
  10168: |-
    Hmmm...
    You do have a point there...
    I guess one round with a prime avatar wouldn't hurtaru.${prompt}
  10169: No, one round could not hurt.${prompt}
  10170: |-
    You know that you probably won't gain anything from this battle-waddle.
    Are you sure you still want the fork?${prompt}
  10171: |-
    Are you really-dilly sure?
    ${selection-lines}
    Fork me!
    On second thought...${prompt}
  10172: |-
    Well, you asked for it!
    Take this ${item-singular: 1[2]} and ring it near one of those giant crystals. The prime avatar won't be slap-happy to be woken up, and you'll have to deal with its wrath.${prompt}
  10173: 'I guess because you are helping us check out this new tuning fork, I can use my mighty-minty magic to warp you near the giant crystal in ${choice: 2}[Ifrit''s Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei''Yin/the Boyahda Tree]. When you''re ready, just show my companion the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  10174: 'The researcher who made the ${item-singular: 1[2]} warned that “the door home would only open to those who defeated the prime avatar.”${prompt}'
  10175: |-
    I'm not quite sure what that is supposed to mean, but I suggest that you prepare well before taking on this journey.
    Remember, you have to be at least a level ${number: 3} summoner.${prompt}
  10176: 'Are you and Carbuncle ready to fight the prime avatar as a level ${number: 3} summoner?${prompt}'
  10177: Also, regardless of whether you defeat the avatar or not, you will be unable to re-enter the protocrystal again for a number of days.${prompt}

    Why do these avatars so despise talking with us that they would rather fight?

  10200: Ahem, now let me introduce myself...${prompt}
  10201: Ah, you are back. How was your battle with the avatar?${prompt}
  10202: Remember, the protocrystals will only resonate with the tuning forks ever so often. Use this time to rest before taking upon another challenge.${prompt}
  10203: I'm a traveling moogle, kupo. I help adventurers in the Outlands access items they have stored in a Mog House elsewhere, kupo.${prompt}

    What did you see? There's nothing in there, rrright?
    I already knew that, though... Huh? You saw a floating island in there?${prompt}
  10259: Haha, nice try. If you're gonna make something up, try for something a little more believable. There's nothing at the top of those stairs besides that altar.${prompt}

  10290: It can't be! Where's the treasure!?${prompt}
  10291: Look for yourself. You won't find any treasure inside, because the box itself is the real treasure. Only a true master could craft such a fine work of art...${prompt}
  10292: Yes, it might have been easy to open, but I do not know if I will ever be able to copy what my grandfather has done.${prompt}
  10293: You'd better not be trying to pull a fast one, Leodarion. If I find out you're hiding any treasure from me...${prompt}

    Ayaya...?
    Ayaya! What are you doing here?${prompt}
  10296: It is unfortunate that we must meet again under these circumstances, Uncle.${prompt}
  10297: I have been assigned by the Bastok government as the head of foreign policy relating to Norg. This includes observation of its members' actions...${prompt}
  10298: You mean...you've been watching me this whole time?${prompt}
  10299: I was just following my orders. When we learned that the members of Norg were once again searching for a lost treasure, I had no choice but to follow you here to gather information.${prompt}
  10300: So, you really are a Musketeer...${prompt}
  10301: Mister...Leodarion. I have heard your story from my father. I feel that I, too, know the true value of that treasure you hold.${prompt}
  10302: Wait... You're Yomi's daughter, aren't you? Yes, I finally think I know what my grandfather was trying to say in his will...${prompt}
  10303: A piece of that person lives on in everything a true master leaves behind. I can feel it whenever I see my mother's blade, just as you can with that box.${prompt}
  10304: I feel it even more when I see how that blade affects the lives of the people around it.${prompt}
  10305: Because of the message that my mother left for me within that blade, I was able to find my own path in life. That path led me to Norg.${prompt}
  10306: I see. As much as we try to follow in someone's footsteps, there are places that we will never reach. That is why we must concentrate on finding our own paths.${prompt}
  10307: |-
    Exactly.
    Uncle, would it be too much to ask to let Mister Leodarion keep his grandfather's box?${prompt}

    Too much to ask? Who needs a dirty old empty box, anyway!?
    What a waste of time!${prompt}
  10309: Oh, and tell your good-for-nothing father to make sure that Kaede comes out to be a little more “understanding” than her sister!${prompt}

  10315: Wow...${prompt}
  10316: Anyway. I'm grateful for all you've done for me. That's why I'm going to let you in on my secret.${prompt}

    Yes. I knew I could do it!

  10326: One play is 100 gil, but as long as you keep paying, you can keep playing.${prompt}
  10327: For each 100 gil, you get one roll of our six-sided die. The number that appears is added to the running total for that day.${prompt}
  10328: The lucky adventurer who rolls the die that gets the running total over 400 wins...get this...a whopping 10000 gil!${prompt}
  10329: And that's not all! You'll receive extra prizes if the total comes to 401 or 402, and a super bonus prize if your roll brings the total to exactly 400!${prompt}
  10330: But be careful; the only time you can find out the running total is after you have rolled.${prompt}
  10331: |-
    And that's it! Pretty simple, huh?
    You can attack from the get go, or you can sit back while other people roll, and then come in for the final kill. We provide you with the die, you choose the strategy.${prompt}
  10332: Alright, enough talk, let's get rolling!${prompt}
  10333: |-
    You rolled a...${number: 1}!
    The running total is now ${number: 3}!${prompt}
  10334: Congratulations! Lady Luck has smiled on you today! Here's your 10000 gil!${prompt}
  10335: And because your roll put the running total at exactly 400, you receive a bonus prize!${prompt}
  10336: And for bringing the total so close to 400, here is your extra prize!${prompt}

    What was I thinking?${prompt}
  10479: Alright, enough talk, you lot.${prompt}
  10480: |-
    Is the next shipment ready to go?
    What am I paying you for? Get back to work.${prompt}
  10481: By the way, Chelvadurai. I gave you the day off to celebrate your daughter's birthday...${prompt}
  10482: |-
    But just because she's not around doesn't mean you can take tomorrow off, as well.
    I'm trying to run a business here, you understand?${prompt}
  10483: |-
    Yes, sir.
    I understand.${prompt}
  10484: '...You don''t think she''s run off, do you?${prompt}'
  10485: I mean, you could work the rest of your life and not pay back those loans by yourself.${prompt}
  10486: Sanctia still has a good thirty years of labor in her, which would be just enough for getting those debts off your back.${prompt}
  10487: And I'm sure she's well aware of that fact by now.${prompt}
  10488: Do you really think she's left me behind...?${prompt}
  10489: |-
    Probably for the best, I say.
    There's something not quite right with that girl.${prompt}
  10490: My guess is she's gone to look for Tavnazia after soaking up all of Zoriboh's fairy tales about the place.${prompt}
  10491: '...${prompt}'
  10492: Sanctia...${prompt}
  10493: Have you finally lost patience with your old man...?${prompt}
  10494: |-
    Looks like one of the cargo haulers has gone missing.
    I wonder if she just got fed up and left?${prompt}
  10495: |-
    Sanctia has always been a daydreamer, though.
    Heard too many of Zoriboh's bedtime stories and got restless, I'd wager.${prompt}
  10496: You say little Sanctia has gone missing?${prompt}
  10497: Don't tell me she's taken to heart those stories I heard in Norg...${prompt}
  10498: You've gotta find her for me, adventurer.${prompt}
  10499: If what you say is true, she's probably headed for the lost nation of Tavnazia.${prompt}
  10500: That means she'll be in Norg, looking for a ship to take her to the Marquisate.${prompt}
  10501: |-
    That place is a haven for the worst kind of pirates and thieves.
    I can't bear to think what would happen to innocent little Sanctia in there...${prompt}
  10502: |-
    You've gotta get there before anything happens to her.
    I'll pay you myself if I have to, but please hurry!${prompt}
  10503: I've seen my fair share of towns, but Rabao is where I feel most comfortable.${prompt}
  10504: I don't know if it's my Galkan blood speaking, or just the soft whisper of the desert sands, but this place just says “home” to me.${prompt}
  10505: |-
    She's where!?
    I can't believe little Sanctia made it to the Tavnazian Archipelago all by herself.
    So, she's planning to become a bounty hunter...${prompt}
  10506: |-
    This is all my fault.
    I never should've filled her head with all those stories of adventure.${prompt}
  10507: 'I told Sanctia of two famous bounty hunters: Goldmane of Tavnazia, and Ismenios Cutsilver of Bastok...${prompt}'
  10508: This pair left their mark on Vana'diel's history with the great deeds they performed twenty years ago.${prompt}
  10509: They are best remembered for capturing the notorious leader of Atarefaunet's Band and handing him over to the San d'Orian government.${prompt}
  10510: The sum they received for Atarefaunet's capture was said to have been unbelievably huge.${prompt}
  10511: Sanctia is probably planning to apprentice herself to Goldmane and make her fortune as a bounty hunter.${prompt}
  10512: I hate to admit it, but her father's debts would be impossible to pay back with any normal wage...${prompt}
  10513: Anyway, I'm relieved to hear she's not alone on her travels.${prompt}
  10514: That moogle has been on the road before and knows which places to avoid.${prompt}
  10515: |-
    That good-for-nothing Chelvadurai.
    His gambling habits are to blame for all this.${prompt}
  10516: |-
    I'll tell him about his daughter myself.
    Here, you've done your part.${prompt}
  10517: I'll let Chelvadurai know what happened to his daughter.${prompt}
  10518: And I'll also give him an earful about kicking his gambling habits.${prompt}
  10519: Sanctia still hasn't returned to Rabao!?${prompt}
  10520: Her father said he would hire the services of an adventurer, but I wonder if he even knows how to go about it?${prompt}
  10521: Zoriboh mentioned he knew the perfect adventurer for the job, though...${prompt}
  10522: ${name-player}, I need your help again.${prompt}
  10523: Sanctia hasn't come back from Tavnazia, and her father and I are worried.${prompt}
  10524: She must still be looking for Goldmane, the bounty hunter I told you about.${prompt}
  10525: I want you to follow Sanctia and keep her out of trouble until she either finds him or gives up on her search.${prompt}
  10526: |-
    What do you say?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'll do it.
    I don't have time for babysitting.${prompt}
  10527: I know she's a handful, but you'll be well paid for your efforts.${prompt}
  10528: Oh, and give this to Sanctia when you find her.${prompt}
  10529: Chelvadurai wanted her to have it for her birthday.${prompt}
  10530: Bring her back safe.${prompt}
  10531: Too busy with your adventures to help anyone, huh?${prompt}
  10532: Little Sanctia has become an adventurer!?${prompt}
  10533: |-
    So Goldmane convinced her that was the best path...
    Well, he'd be about the only person she'd listen to.${prompt}
  10534: By the way, did you remember to give Sanctia the package from her father?${prompt}
  10535: Mister Zoriboh!${prompt}
  10536: |-
    Chelvadurai, we were just talking about you.
    The adventurer we hired has returned.
    Now, about Sanctia...${prompt}
  10537: |-
    She's become an adventurer!
    And this package is for me...?${prompt}
  10538: |-
    There's a letter inside.
    Sanctia says that she'll send more money from her adventures so that I can pay back my loans and go back to my wife...${prompt}
  10539: |-
    She's a good kid.
    Time for you to pull up your bootstraps and follow her example.${prompt}
  10540: I intend to do just that, Mister Zoriboh.${prompt}
  10541: |-
    Thanks for all your help, ${name-player}.
    It's not much, but here's a little something from me.${prompt}
  10542: If you run into little Sanctia again on your travels, make sure she's keeping out of mischief.${prompt}
  10543: "I'll never let her down again. \nIf Sanctia grows weary of her new life, you tell her she always has a place here with me.${prompt}"
  10544: |-
    Sanctia's still young and full of fire.
    I'm sure she'll make a fine adventurer.${prompt}
  10545: |-
    I heard the news from Chelvadurai.
    Who'd have thought that girl would get her head out of the clouds long enough to do something constructive?${prompt}
  10546: |-
    Well, as long as I get my money back, I'm not really concerned either way.
    I've heard adventurers can make a fortune these days...${prompt}
  10547: |-
    And once Sanctia becomes a famous hero, she can help me advertise my business.
    Heh-heh-heh!${prompt}
  10548: |-
    Hmmm...
    So, you have heard the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}
  10549: |-
    There is more to the rumor than you know.
    The branch and the thread that those monstrosities have swallowed are the base materials for a legendary fishing rod.${prompt}
  10550: |-
    Should you manage to obtain those materials, bring them here to me.
    I am the only one left alive who can craft the rod of legend.${prompt}
  10551: |-
    Incredible...
    This is a feat worthy of the greatest anglers in history.${prompt}
  10552: |-
    Leave these in my care.
    Come to me again when the sun has passed through her cycle and you will be the first to witness an unbreakable spirit.${prompt}
  10553: |-
    Please, do not rush me.
    The crafting of a legend is not the work of mere moments.${prompt}
  10554: |-
    It is complete.
    I must thank you for this chance to create such a masterpiece.${prompt}
  10555: This fishing rod will never break or splinter...${prompt}

  10624: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt}
  10625: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  10626: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt}
  10627: |-
    Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.
    If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt}
  10628: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  10629: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  10630: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  10631: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  10632: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  10633: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  10634: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  10635: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  10636: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  10637: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  10638: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10639: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  10640: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  10641: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  10642: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  10643: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  10644: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  10645: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  10646: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  10647: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10648: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  10649: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  10650: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  10651: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  10652: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  10653: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  10654: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  10655: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  10656: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  10657: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  10658: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  10659: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  10660: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  10661: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  10662: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  10663: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  10664: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  10665: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  10666: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  10667: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  10668: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  10669: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  10670: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  10671: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  10672: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  10673: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10674: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  10675: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  10676: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  10677: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  10678: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  10679: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  10680: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  10681: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  10682: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  10683: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  10684: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  10685: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  10686: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  10687: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  10688: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  10689: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  10690: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  10691: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  10692: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  10693: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  10694: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  10695: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  10696: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  10697: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  10698: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  10699: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  10700: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  10701: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  10702: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  10703: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  10704: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  10705: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  10706: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  10707: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?

    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  10731: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  10732: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  10733: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  10734: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  10735: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  10736: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}

    That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.
    Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt}
  10738: |-
    An aspiring synergist, I see!
    If you're looking for ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you've certainly come to the right place.${prompt}

    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.

    Invisible to you, at least.
    It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt}

    Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.
    So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt}

  10759: |-
    Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!
    It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt}
  10760: Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt}
  10761: |-
    If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!
    No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”
    Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt}
  10762: Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt}
  10763: If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt}

    Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul.
    Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.${prompt}
  10875: By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.${prompt}
  10876: 'At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}'
  10877: Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.${prompt}
  10878: That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.${prompt}
  10879: From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.${prompt}
  10880: But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.${prompt}
  10881: The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt}
  10882: |-
    Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all.
    As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.${prompt}
  10883: We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.${prompt}
  10884: 'Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level ${number: 0}. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.${prompt}'
  10885: |-
    Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands.

  11772: Deep within lightless ruins that stretch out beneath Elshimo Island reside these most fascinating denizens.${prompt}
  11773: The twinkling light in their eyes reminds us that divinity is found in all of the Goddess's creatures--and their name reflects that.${prompt}
  11774: Yet even such mystical legends pale in comparison to those suggesting their presence in Vollbow.${prompt}
  11775: Errant troubadours spin tales of remnants sunk far beneath the Zafmlug Sea, claiming that these briny creatures nibble away at the encroaching kelp to keep the marble halls pristine.${prompt}
  11776: Perhaps they are naught more than tall tales, but some threads of truth give me pause.${prompt}
  11777: Ah, many a traveler has been wooed by the tale of the quicksilver blade, a myth from Aht Urhgan on the Aradjiah continent that locals hold to be true.${prompt}
  11778: An otherwise nondescript weaver spouted a most unusual experience he had when traversing the Silver Sea toward Azouph Isle. His vessel became shrouded in fog, and he scarce could see more than several ilms in front of himself.${prompt}
  11779: A blade of the purest silver burst from the sea and came crashing down, threatening to cleave the vessel from stem to stern.${prompt}
  11780: The young lad fainted from fright, and when he opened his eyes found himself surrounded on all sides by curious Qiqirns.${prompt}
  11781: The more superstitious of the common folk went stark mad, claiming that it was long-forgotten spirits from the Kingdom of Ephramad come to exact vengeance on the living.${prompt}
  11782: Fie, I say. Blades do not emerge from the depths of the sea. Doubtless it was a fish or similar sea creature of a more aggressive nature.${prompt}
  11783: But for such a piscine specimen to be mistaken for a blade of pure metal...the mind simply boggles, does it not?${prompt}
  11784: Some years ago there existed a seascape called Vunkerl Inlet in the region known as Derfland.${prompt}
  11785: Though many oceanic species dwelled in waters both shallow and deep, one in particular was said to be the apple of every fisherman's eye, for it was as bright as pure sunlight.${prompt}
  11786: I myself traveled to Derfland on one occasion, hoping to reel one in and make my name known throughout the land.${prompt}
  11787: But the claws of war plunged their way into my back and I was forced to retreat, my pride wounded as much as my flesh.${prompt}
  11788: Were I to recite my failures as a fisherman, that would doubtlessly be the first.${prompt}
  11789: Have you heard tales of the four legendary fish?${prompt}
  11790: 'They are ancient beings which numbered four: ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${item-singular: 1[2]}, ${item-singular: 2[2]}, and ${item-singular: 3[2]}.${prompt}'
  11791: Yet there were curious reports of a legendary fisherman who hauled in a fifth whose name was not listed in even the most complete fishing treatise.${prompt}
  11792: He was said to have found the beast in Misareaux Coast, abutting the Zafmlug Sea.${prompt}
  11793: Imitators quickly flocked to the area and cast their lines, hoping that fortune would smile on them...only to return hunched over and empty-handed.${prompt}
  11794: The fisherman came to be the laughingstock of his guild, ridiculed and belittled for claiming to catch something that by all accounts did not exist.${prompt}
  11795: One eve he departed the guild, never to be heard from again.${prompt}
  11796: Yet I cannot help but think there are grains of truth in that sandy story.${prompt}
  11797: Which reminds me...the tale goes that he cut open the stomachs of the four dragons and used the innards as bait.${prompt}
  11798: That leaves the small matter of the location...but I am quite certain you can figure it out.${prompt}
  11799: Far to the west lies the continent of Ulbuka, a land said to be at the heart of geomantic leylines. This story has been passed down from the primal geomancer through her five disciples and to the present day.${prompt}
  11800: Serpents are said to guard the vast natural energies pulsating in a cavernous region of the continent.${prompt}
  11801: These keepers of the gates fervently believe that the serpents are intimately connected with the lifestream and are immortal as long as that bond is not severed.${prompt}
  11802: Those selfsame keepers claim that something lives in the waters within the caves' deepest recesses.${prompt}
  11803: What fascinates me most about this legend is the idea that non-sentient beings can be connected to the lifestream.${prompt}
  11804: I have the utmost faith that if anyone could fish up a legend beyond legends, it would be you.${prompt}
  11805: And thus with bated breath I sit, anxiously awaiting your return.${prompt}

  12295: Mandragora Mania is a game in which you battle for jingly by moving your mandragora pieces to the goal.${prompt}
  12296: 'Your goal is the ${choice: 0}[red/blue/green] one on the right, while your opponent''s is the ${choice: 0}[blue/green/red] one on the left.${prompt}'
  12297: At the start of the game, three mandragoras each will be placed on the eight game areas, excluding the goal.${prompt}
  12298: There are five starting placements (A through E), and you are able to select which one you would like to employ. The default setting is "Random."${prompt}
  12299: This explanation uses pattern A, but the basic rules are the same regardless of the starting pattern.${prompt}
  12300: 'The three ${choice: 0}[red/blue/green] areas in front of you are yours,${wait-36: 2}the three ${choice: 0}[blue/green/red] areas at the back are your opponent''s,${wait-36: 2}and the remaining two are neutral.${prompt}'
  12301: You must choose one area--either yours or a neutral one--to proceed.${prompt}
  12302: The areas are numbered from one to five starting from the left, and any mandragoras in the area you select will move.${prompt}
  12303: Conversely, your opponent must select either a neutral area or an area that belongs to them.${prompt}
  12304: From the right, those areas are numbered 6, 4, 7, 2, and 8.${prompt}

  12306: Note that the mandragoras will move from the back first--last in, first out.${prompt}
  12307: You will receive points known as “jingly” each time one of your mandragoras reaches the goal.${prompt}
  12308: You will enter your opponent's territory whenever you go past the goal.${prompt}
  12309: If one of your mandragoras happens to reach the opponent's goal, the goal will be pushed back and your mandragora will return to your own area. You don't have to worry about your mandragora earning any jingly for your opponent.${prompt}
  12310: The order in which players choose areas will be determined based on your turn settings. The default setting is random.${prompt}
  12311: This explanation has skipped past your opponent's turn for demonstration purposes, but in the actual game you and your opponent will take turns choosing areas.${prompt}
  12312: However, if the last mandragora to move reaches the goal, you will get to take an additional turn.${prompt}
  12313: Mandragoras are a very diverse species, and the amount of jingly you earn is determined by the species of mandragora that crosses into the goal.${prompt}
  12314: 'Adenium and citrullus: 3 jingly (first player)/4 jingly (second player).${prompt}'

  12356: I'm sorry... Were Gumbah and the others worried about me?${prompt}

  12359: I have a feeling they were telling me that I needed to give someone an important message!${prompt}

    Do you know of Revelation Rock in the Western Altepa Desert?
    It's a large rock that rises up to the heavens above.${prompt}
  12362: Long ago, the Galka who lived on this island used it for their spiritual training.${prompt}
  12363: |-
    As such, I think my journey of rebirth may have begun from there...
    That's why I decided to check it out.${prompt}
  12364: |-
    However, that wasn't the mountain I saw in my dream.
    I wonder where it could be...${prompt}
  12365: So I then decided to look around here for anything that the Galka who used to live here might've left behind.${prompt}
  12366: In doing so, the adventurers in Rabao told me that there's a statue of a Galka deep within the Quicksand Caves.${prompt}
  12367: So, would you mind going with me to investigate?${prompt}
  12368: Although I could probably make it on my own if I kept myself hidden, I'm a little scared...${prompt}

  12374: |-
    I'll write them a letter, so please go on ahead.
    You just need to enter the Quicksand Caves via the northwest entrance to the Western Altepa Desert.${prompt}
  12375: Once you're inside, head to the southeast and you should come across a small room containing the statue...${prompt}
  12376: |-
    Although, there is a rather special door along the way, and they say only an adult Galka can open it.
    I guess it's rather heavy.${prompt}
  12377: So I think it'd be a good idea for you to bring as many of your adventuring pals as possible, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12378: |-
    Other than that, I heard there is one other way to open the door.
    You need something called ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}
  12379: |-
    The one who told me about it said it could be obtained in the Eastern Altepa Desert.
    Fortunately, I was able to borrow one from him.${prompt}
  12380: Afterwards, head to the southeast and you should come across a small room containing the statue.${prompt}
  12381: Of course, it is possible that I still won't remember anything even after seeing the statue.${prompt}
  12382: |-
    But I can't just sit around doing nothing either.
    That is why I need your help.${prompt}
  12383: |-
    It seems the child known as Raebrimm came here from Bastok.
    Will you be taking him back home?${prompt}
  12384: |-
    Huh!? Are you mad--heading to the Quicksand Caves!?
    That place is crawling with Antica!${prompt}
  12385: You're the adventurer that was looking for Raebrimm, right?${prompt}
  12386: He was just asking me if there were any Galka in Rabao who are nearing their journey of rebirth.${prompt}
  12387: As far as I know, there aren't any at the current moment.${prompt}
  12388: However, if someone really is looking to abduct such a Galka, I gathered some volunteers to help patrol the area.${prompt}
  12389: Oh, look! There's Raebrimm now.${prompt}
  12390: ${name-player}!
  12391: I went on ahead to speak with the people in Rabao.${prompt}
  12392: Like Dancing Wolf said, there doesn't appear to be any Galka currently on their journey of rebirth here.${prompt}
  12393: However, that just might mean that they don't know of any or maybe they've already been abducted...${prompt}
  12394: Oh, that reminds me! I managed to remember a few more details regarding my rebirth!${prompt}
  12395: The mountain I climbed was a mountain in Valhalla, right?${prompt}
  12396: |-
    Once I knew that, I was finally able to remember!
    Someone on the mountain told me the following...${prompt}
  12397: “When the World Eater Egg is awakened, the Galka will be led to open the gate to the underworld...”${prompt}
  12398: |-
    The World Eater Egg... The gate to the underworld...
    We've learned a lot from the Destiny Destroyers.${prompt}
  12399: |-
    They mentioned that the Galka are special to Odin, the god of the underworld.
    So that must be why I was given that message...${prompt}
  12400: However, I'm not the Talekeeper, so I quickly forgot everything I was told.${prompt}
  12401: Besides, only the most elite Galka are capable of leading our people.${prompt}
  12402: That is why I must speak with the Talekeeper.${prompt}
  12403: 'Hey, ${choice: 6}[miss/mister]!'
  12404: Are you surprised to see me here!?${prompt}
  12405: '...I agreed to listen to what Gumbah had to say, but I never thought it would bring me here, of all places.${prompt}'
  12406: Iron Eater told me everything. The beastmen are after this “World Eater Egg” and it's all just one big mess.${prompt}
  12407: And Raebrimm had the eggshell, so that's why the black-clad Goblin was after him, right?${prompt}
  12408: So what about Raebrimm? Did he learn anything new here?${prompt}
  12409: What!? That dangerous mage known as Uran-Mafran did what now!?${prompt}
  12410: I see... I guess Cornelia was right to be worried.${prompt}
  12411: Is that true? I find it hard to believe that we visit some land known as Valhalla after we die.${prompt}
  12412: Well, even if it is true, what does that actually mean?${prompt}
  12413: And who is this master that Uran-Mafran is trying to bring back from Valhalla?${prompt}
  12414: |-
    Actually, that's not important right now.
    We should be more concerned about him learning the secret of our rebirth and trying to force open the gate to Valhalla.${prompt}
  12415: He is trying to stain the process of our rebirth, no?${prompt}
  12416: |-
    If that was the extent of it, that'd be one thing.
    However, if he destroys the gate in the process, that might mean that we could never be reborn again!${prompt}
  12417: I'm not sure if this Uran-Mafran knows where to find the gate to the underworld, but we should probably prepare for the worst.${prompt}
  12418: As such, it is imperative that we get there first and defend it from his evil plan.${prompt}
  12419: You're right! We should send a report to Bastok and then ask the soldiers here for help!${prompt}
  12420: |-
    Hmm... We don't have time to wait for reinforcements.
    I think we'll need to ask this adventurer here to assist us.${prompt}
  12421: You have already come this far... Will you help the Galka in our time of need?${prompt}
  12422: |-
    Will you help the Galka?
    ${selection-lines}
    You can count on me.
    Sorry, I can't.${prompt}
  12423: You've come this far! You can't give up now!${prompt}
  12424: |-
    I knew we could count on you.
    However, I must ask that you refrain from telling anyone about this unless absolutely necessary.${prompt}
  12425: Especially about the process of our rebirth and the location of the gate to the underworld.${prompt}
  12426: Okay, so the gate to the underworld that we must defend is located to the east of Reasoning Rock in the Western Altepa Desert.${prompt}
  12427: It lies beyond a door that we Galka commonly refer to as the Altepa Gate.${prompt}
  12428: Normally, one must perform a series of steps in order to open the door.${prompt}
  12429: However, it opens automatically when a Galka who is near death stands before it.${prompt}
  12430: Hmm... It would be nice if Uran-Mafran was unable to find a Galka currently on his journey...${prompt}
  12431: Wait, has anybody seen Raebrimm?${prompt}
  12432: |-
    Where is Raebrimm?
    ${selection-lines}
    I don't know.
    He's on patrol.
    He's gone!${prompt}
  12433: |-
    Hmm... I better go look for him.
    Something doesn't feel right...${prompt}
  12434: He is? Still, I want to go and make sure he's safe.${prompt}
  12435: |-
    He's gone? You mean nobody knows where he is?
    I've got a bad feeling about this...${prompt}
  12436: |-
    Gumbah, you'd better report back to Bastok first.
    You can look for Raebrimm later.${prompt}
  12437: |-
    As for you, you should go on ahead.
    We need you to figure out how to open Altepa Gate.${prompt}
  12438: |-
    What's going to happen?
    The tone in Oggbi and Gumbah's voice makes it sound much more dangerous than I expected.${prompt}
  12439: |-
    My assignment here was supposed to be nice and easy...
    No, I must forget about that and focus on the task at hand!${prompt}
  12440: Don't worry. We've received word that messengers have been dispatched carrying the news that any Galka on a journey of rebirth is being targeted.${prompt}
  12441: |-
    However, we have no idea when they will arrive.
    So we have no choice but to rely on Oggbi for now.${prompt}
  12442: |-
    What!? Raebrimm was abducted by the mage Uran-Mafran!?
    When did that happen!?${prompt}
  12443: Well, I'm glad to hear that Raebrimm and everyone else are safe now, but this whole situation is making my head spin!${prompt}
  12444: |-
    This is quite the situation.
    I never imagined that the door to our rebirth could be closed...${prompt}
  12445: |-
    Oh! Please keep this information between us.
    I know you understand the reason why...${prompt}
  12446: |-
    This is most troubling news.
    I can't believe that the gateway to our rebirth is closed...${prompt}
  12447: |-
    It's the fault of that Tarutaru mage, Uran-Mafran.
    He's going to pay dearly for this!${prompt}
  12448: |-
    Ooh...
    To remember...and be remembered...${prompt}
  12449: Ask, and you shall retrieve!
  12450: Only a top Galka leader can get other Galka to follow him.${prompt}
  12451: That is why I need to tell the Talekeeper the secret message...${prompt}
  12452: I would be quite interested to hear this m-m-message as well.${prompt}
  12453: Uran-Mafran!?
  12454: Raebrimm, is that Uran-Mafran!?${prompt}
  12455: |-
    Yeah!
    Be careful! He's a real bad man!${prompt}
  12456: |-
    That hurts, you know.
    I am m-m-merely pursuing m-m-my own personal justice.${prompt}
  12457: Uran-Mafran, there are no Galka here who are on the journey of rebirth.${prompt}
  12458: |-
    Furthermore, a group of musketeers from Bastok is here to take you in.
    Surrender and come quietly.${prompt}
  12459: |-
    Is that so?
    Fine, I will surrender, but I want you to answer my question first.${prompt}
  12460: Wh-what!?
  12461: The beastmen in the group known as the Destiny Destroyers told me.${prompt}
  12462: Raebrimm, I know that you were given a special mission when you climbed the mountain in Valhalla as part of your rebirth.${prompt}
  12463: |-
    You were given the World Eater Egg eggshell and entrusted with a message.
    I want to know what that message was.${prompt}
  12464: When the World Eater Egg is awakened,${prompt}
  12465: the Galka will be led to open the gate to the underworld...${prompt}
  12466: |-
    Now I get it!
    I always knew you were special!${prompt}
  12467: You were chosen by my illustrious m-m-master, the Maelstrom Mage, Garazu-Horeizu!${prompt}
  12468: What!?
  12469: No!!!
  12470: |-
    Ooh...
    Memory...complete...${prompt}
  12471: Wh-wh-what does this mean!?${prompt}
  12472: No... I already know what it means.${prompt}
  12473: The musketeers told me that Uran-Mafran is capable of wielding highly unusual magic.${prompt}
  12474: I just never thought that I would've already been put under his spell!${prompt}
  12475: And even more than that, I now know that Raebrimm was abducted from right under our noses.${prompt}
  12476: I am ashamed for going all this time without even noticing it.${prompt}
  12477: Fortunately, you were able to rescue Raebrimm from Uran-Mafran after that.${prompt}

    It's a bit late for me to be thanking you, but please let me do so anyway.
    You have my eternal gratitude.${prompt}

  12480: I am ashamed for going all this time without even noticing it.${prompt}
  12481: |-
    Ooh...
    To remember...and be remembered...
