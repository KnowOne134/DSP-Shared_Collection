    Conquest points.
    The effects of controlling regions.
    Regions controlled by other nations.
    Regions under beastman control.${prompt}
  7402: All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt}
  7403: Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt}
  7404: Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt}
  7405: So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt}
  7406: |-
    Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.
    They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt}
  7407: Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt}
  7408: Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt}
  7409: |-
    So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.
    We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt}
  7410: |-
    You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.
    Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt}
  7411: |-
    Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.
    The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt}
  7412: |-
    You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  7413: |-
    We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  7414: |-
    You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.
    Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt}
  7415: Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt}
  7416: |-
    You also receive rank points for completing missions.
    Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt}
  7417: |-
    You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.
    Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}
  7418: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt}
  7419: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt}
  7420: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt}
  7421: Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt}
  7422: Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt}
  7423: Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt}
  7424: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt}
  7425: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt}
  7426: |-
    Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.
    If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt}
  7427: If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt}
  7428: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt}
  7429: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt}
  7430: There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt}
  7431: |-
    Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.
    Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.${prompt}

  7893: Sure, I got everything I wanted, but what was left to me in the end? For one rash action, all I gained was an empty title and irreconcilable guilt...${prompt}
  7894: I doubt you'll listen to the words of a traitor, but please, help free him from the bonds of his eternal night...
  7895: Our expedition was supposed to have been an allied effortaru, but not one of us was interested in the fate of the other nations. In our hasty-waste to outdo each other, we failed to see to the heart of the mattaru.${prompt}
  7896: |-
    Our attitudes led to the death of two of our members, and precipitated the birth of the Shadow Lord...
    This sin does not belong on Raogrimm's shoulders alone. We all mustaru atone for our actions.${prompt}
  7897: Please help him. Help Raogrimm escape from his horrid-worrid darkness, forever this time.
  7898: Humes and Galka have never been the best of friends. I used to think that was just the way it was, and always would be.${prompt}
  7899: I figured I'd be causing myself grrrief if I stuck my whiskers into other nations' problems. My next catnap was all that mattered to me in those days. Ignorrrance is bliss, as they say.${prompt}
  7900: Responsibility for Raogrimm's trrransformation lies with all of us who traveled with him on that expedition. By sharing the blame for the crimes he committed as the Shadow Lord, we can finally call ourselves his trrrue companions.${prompt}
  7901: |-
    Let me help you on your path. May guiding light fill this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    Raogrimm's fate is in your hands.
  7902: There is a broken branch thrust into the ground here.${prompt}
  7903: There is a symbol carved into the rock here.${prompt}
  7904: I have been waiting for you.${prompt}
  7905: |-
    Do you remember the last words Raogrimm spoke to you? "The link will soon be severed"...
    Do you understand the significance of these words?${prompt}
  7906: |-
    When the soul that was divided is whole once again, towering rage will take on physical form...
    Yes, a new Shadow Lord will be born. Even I will no longer hear his voice.${prompt}
  7907: Even now, I can barely feel the emanations of Raogrimm's faltering spirit. When those emanations fade completely, he will be...${prompt}
  7908: The Xarcabard of that other realm is shrouded in a vast darkness, preventing contact from the outside. Even those of us without material bodies are unable to penetrate that mist of eternal night.${prompt}
  7909: "Until that mist clears, I cannot guide you to Xarcabard. \nThe next place you must venture is the twin of Vana'diel's Beaucedine. There you will find the last trophy to complete the set of keys we need.${prompt}"
  7910: |-
    You must obtain the last trophy.
    All five trophies combined with our power will create a synergistic force, allowing us to part the shroud for a few precious moments. It will open a path between worlds.${prompt}
  7911: |-
    Take care, my brave adventurer.
    May the blessings of Altana guide and protect you...
  7912: |-
    Even after the blackest night, the golden sun always rises to begin a new morning.
    This troubled land will soon have its dawn...of that I am certain.${prompt}
  7913: |-
    I never thought to walk this land again, not even in death.
    Is this what they call karma...?${prompt}
  7914: |-
    This land has borne the weight of my sins.
    I will not beg for forgiveness, but accept my responsibility...${prompt}
  7915: |-
    So this is the reason for that unspeakable terror I feltaru here when I was still alive. It's possible that the other realm has existed for much longer than anyone ever dreamed...
    Keep your wits aboutaru you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7916: |-
    I'm not rrreally fond of touching platitudes.
    Snap Raogrimm to his senses with a big ol' smack to the head for me.${prompt}
  7917: |-
    It is time!
    Put an end to this thirty-year nightmare, ${name-player}.
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! Show us the path to Xarcabard!
  7918: Death does not exist in that realm. You might call it a “prison of souls.”${prompt}
  7919: |-
    Even those who fall in battle will rise again after a time as if nothing had happened.
    Like a flame returning to a candle whose light has been extinguished...${prompt}
  7920: It is an endless succession of life and death. How many times has that cycle repeated itself in that damned abode?${prompt}
  7921: There is one thing that bothers me. Whatever happened to the original wielders of the weapons and armor that the beastmen there now possess? If the statues in the shape of Orcs and such were once actual beastmen, then...? But I get carried away with my musings.${prompt}
  7922: |-
    Please pay no mind to my ramblings.
    You have secured the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. An incredible feat. It proves the strength of your conviction, and is one of the keys you will need to enter Xarcabard.${prompt}
  7923: |-
    You will need four such trophies.
    Once you have them within your grasp, make your way to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. Cornelia awaits you there.${prompt}
  7924: I don't know about the other four, but I can't hear his voice anymore...${prompt}
  7925: Is this another brand I must bear for my treachery? I must truly be hated if that's the case.${prompt}
  7926: |-
    It is something I would wish for at the moment, however. I pray this silence is just a continuation of our incompatible personalities.
    If not, then it means his pronouncement has become reality...${prompt}
  7927: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    This is more than just a testament to your strength. It is one of the keys that will lead you to Xarcabard, along with the trophies of the other realms.${prompt}
  7928: |-
    When you have all four trophies, travel to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. You will find Cornelia waiting for you there.
    That is all the wisdom I have left to give you.${prompt}
  7929: |-
    What is the true nature of that other world? I can only explain it as a place that lies beyond the limitarus of our knowledge.
    But I'm sure I've feltaru that aura somewhere before...${prompt}
  7930: That's it. That protocrystal I came across when I was doing research in Elshimo. The magical emanations coming from the crystal gave me a similar impression. An avatar? No, that can'taru be...${prompt}
  7931: |-
    Oh! Oh, I'm terribly-werribly sorry!
    I appear to have driftarued into my old habits.${prompt}
  7932: |-
    Now, ${name-player}.
    This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is both a symbol of your fortitude, and one of the keys that will help you gain access to Xarcabard. The trophies from the other three realms carry the same importance.${prompt}
  7933: Gather all four trophies and hurry yourself on to Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia will be waiting for you when you get there. But be wary, ${name-player}. The blackness enveloping that world grows ever deeper, ever darker...${prompt}
  7934: The beastmen of that world carry the spoils of prrrevious battles. Equipment that you or I would use.${prompt}
  7935: I'm not able to touch them in my prrresent form, but I feel something about those weapons and armor...something extrrraordinary.${prompt}
  7936: |-
    Wait, wait, wait!
    I don't mean that they're currrsed or anything like that! It's something more like, um, not ominous, but...
    How can I explain it?${prompt}
  7937: Anyway! They're not evil, just...you know? Different from other normal swords and things. Being all ghostlike and stuff, you can feel things like that.${prompt}
  7938: |-
    But enough of that kinda talk--congrrratulations are in order!
    You've got your paws on the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! It shows you've got the goods in the hero department, and it will also help you get into Xarcabard.${prompt}
  7939: But first you've got to collect the other three trophies and then hightail it to snowy Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia should be up there waiting for you.${prompt}
  7940: "${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and the four trophies.\nThese artifacts have long been lost to that other world. \nThe Hydra Corps was a unit formed after our expedition to the Northlands.${prompt}"
  7941: |-
    It must have been in the time of the Great War...
    Nobody knows how the Hydra artifacts came to be there, but those five trophies will open the path for you.${prompt}
  7942: Each of these items holds a measure of power. However, the strength of a single artifact is limited.${prompt}
  7943: |-
    The ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} and the ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.
    Combining these separate entities created a bridge from Vana'diel to the other realms.
    Xarcabard, I'm afraid, is another matter entirely...${prompt}
  7944: |-
    Unless the shroud of darkness is lifted, that power alone will not be enough to open the way.
    However, the five trophies resonate with another artifact that lies within his land. If we can join our strength to theirs...${prompt}
  7945: Let us make haste to the land where this all began. To Xarcabard...${prompt}
  7946: Is it over...?${prompt}
  7947: No, the rage has merely been dispersed.${prompt}
  7948: As long as I exist, he will never truly die...${prompt}
  7949: Or perhaps an eternal soul is something beyond the concept of death?${prompt}
  7950: |-
    ${name-player}...
    You have achieved an incredible feat--the unification of the Shadow Lord has been prevented.
    I have not the words to express my gratitude.${prompt}
  7951: |-
    The power of the crystal has faded, but I will be drawn into that towering rage no more.
    I have heard the voice of the one who holds sway over this realm...${prompt}
  7952: The one who holds sway...?${prompt}
  7953: |-
    Yes. From the center of infinite darkness.
    I was in a place beyond comprehension when those words reached into my mind...${prompt}
  7954: |-
    You who have touched the crystal, the one who holds immortal power within a mortal shell.
    The rage that has arisen from your twisted core will devour my world.${prompt}
  7955: |-
    It was an error in judgment to shelter you...
    The order of my realm has been disrupted.${prompt}
  7956: |-
    I give to you a duty...
    You will stand vigil until an age without hatred has dawned.${prompt}
  7957: |-
    No matter what terrible power you might wield, there is no escape from Dynamis for an incomplete soul.
    No return to the land of blessed light...${prompt}
  7958: |-
    What manner of being was this who spoke from a pit of blackness?
    As this question gnawed at my mind, the voice grew quiet, leaving me in unanswered silence.${prompt}
  7959: |-
    Of one thing I was certain.
    This voice belonged to the ruler of Dynamis.${prompt}
  7960: A flow of energy exists in Vana'diel that has escaped the notice of those who dwell there.${prompt}
  7961: |-
    Thirty years past, my contact with the crystal caused an accelerated change in this flow.
    It was as if it had leapt forward, rushing along a deliberate course.${prompt}
  7962: |-
    Nobody knows what lies at the end of this journey.
    Perhaps it will reveal the true nature of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7963: ${name-player}, you may be the one to witness this truth.${prompt}
  7964: |-
    The power stored in the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will soon be drained.
    And I must remain in this world in my role of observer.${prompt}
  7965: |-
    Do not forget who you are, ${name-player}.
    I bid farewell to a most heroic adventurer.${prompt}
  7966: My old companions...?
  7967: |-
    This duty is too much for just one to bear.
    If you will have me, I will stand at your side until an age without hatred has arrived.
    It pains me to see the depths to which my country has fallen.${prompt}
  7968: That is my only reason for staying. Do not misunderstand my motivations.${prompt}
  7969: |-
    Blessed light and the ruler of Dynamis?
    I do believe you've rekindled my long-forgotten sense of adventure.${prompt}
  7970: |-
    Once I've gotten all firedy-up, even you can'taru keep me back, Raogrimm.
    I'm sure my incomparable research skills will be of use in your task.${prompt}
  7971: |-
    C'mon, let's see a little excitement!
    This is our expedition's thirty-year rrreunion.${prompt}
  7972: |-
    It's not the Northlands this time.
    None of us are going to grow old and die, so who else would you want with you on a task as long as this one?${prompt}
  7973: |-
    I'm not gonna back down, no matterrr how much you complain.
    Better just give in and accept the fact that you're stuck with me.${prompt}
  7974: |-
    I thought this would be the end of you for sure...
    Hmph. You're just as thick-skinned as you used to be.${prompt}
  7975: |-
    What, no words for an old friend?
    Thinking about testing your theory on whether or not a soul can be killed?${prompt}
  7976: |-
    I betrayed you!
    I extinguished the light of your precious Cornelia!
    The man responsible for this entire nightmare stands right before you!${prompt}
  7977: |-
    Everything began thirty years ago.
    And there were things that came to an end...
    Even though I was a prisoner of uncontrollable rage, the fact remains that I took the lives of my companions with my own hands.${prompt}
  7978: And yet, my old companions, you are the ones who have saved me from falling into that pit of hatred a second time.${prompt}
  7979: |-
    I have words of gratitude, but do not stand in a position to blame anyone for their actions.
    No matter who that person may be.${prompt}
  7980: Raogrimm...${prompt}
  7981: |-
    Are you sure you want to do this?
    This duty will continue until hatred has faded from the land.
    As long as my divided soul remains, there may never be an end to that rage...${prompt}
  7982: |-
    Raogrimm.
    There is no need to suffer alone anymore.
    Our presence here should answer your question.${prompt}
  7983: |-
    There are crimes that must be atoned for.
    And if that means staying on after death and watching over this world, then we who were your companions will share the burden along with you.${prompt}
  7984: |-
    Until the dawn of an age without hatred...
    No, as long as this world continues to be, I will remain by your side.${prompt}

  7992: |-
    Are you lost? Or are you here by your own reckless designs?
    Either way, this is not your dream.${prompt}

  7994: Who would dare bring a new dream into my world of Dynamis?${prompt}
  7995: I divided my form in order to find the answer, but my counterpart has yet to return to me.${prompt}
  7996: While wandering through this realm, you may come across another semblance of myself.${prompt}
  7997: The memory of our encounter will become a guide to my shadow as it wanders this dream.${prompt}

  8002: |-
    But you cannot grasp the identity of this realm's dreamer from there.
    This land will continue to devour its way into Dynamis.${prompt}
  8003: You must find my counterpart and crush the dreamer of this realm.${prompt}
  8004: I see that you have gathered three slivers of black crystal...${prompt}
  8005: The Emptiness is sealed inside of them. Those are no mere fragments.${prompt}
  8006: |-
    Those pieces of crystal have led you to this place...
    The source of this nightmare is near. I can feel the dreamer's presence.${prompt}

    The entrance to the dream has already been opened.
    Find and destroy the source if you wish to protect my realm.${prompt}
  8008: I am...a unique entity...${prompt}

  8010: Intermingling with one another...dividing among each other...${prompt}
  8011: And devouring one another...${prompt}
  8012: The shadow that you defeated had been consumed by the dreamer of this realm.${prompt}
  8013: It seems that this nightmare was dreamt into existence by beings who have come into contact with the Emptiness.${prompt}

    Could it have been that girl...?
    No, there was one more, transformed after death...${prompt}
  8017: Her malice will not perish as long as this dream continues, using my shadows to revive countless times.${prompt}
  8018: You must confront the nightmare and continue to fight them to keep this realm from spreading.${prompt}
  8019: |-
    The dreamer is not the girl who once harbored the Emptiness...
    Could it have been transferred to another girl...?${prompt}

  8203: Bathed in that light, the world entered an age of bliss until, after a time, the gods fell into slumber.
  8204: |-
    That world was called Vana'diel.
    But the song continues...${prompt}
  8205: However, this age will not last. The great bane will devour the fair land of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  8206: The ancient seal will be broken, awakening nightmares of ages past.${prompt}
  8207: |-
    A tragic age of darkness will reign.
    And yet, the gods will not wake from their slumber...${prompt}
  8208: Yes, it's all becoming so clear now...${prompt}
  8209: The lay of the ancient gods, a song never meant to reach mortal ears...${prompt}
  8210: The strains of the forbidden verse have spilled over into our world, weaving themselves into the rush of the wind, the crash of the waves, and the heartbeats of every living being on Vana'diel.${prompt}
  8211: It has already become one with us, never to return to its rightful time and place.${prompt}
  8212: |-
    A single sound echoes, then echoes once more.
    What began as a whisper grows into a roar as it reverberates through time and space.${prompt}
  8213: |-
    Don't you see, ${name-player}?
    There's no turning back...not now.${prompt}
  8214: The fate of mankind--of this very world--has been set in motion.${prompt}
  8215: The lost song remains undiscovered.${prompt}
  8216: |-
    There is a great and terrible battle still to be fought over this song...
    A battle that will see the love and hatred of the ancient gods shake this world to its very core.${prompt}
  8217: |-
    A battle from which even you, ${name-player}, will not return unscathed...
    But now is not the time for such talk.
    You will see for yourself...in due time.${prompt}
  8218: |-
    Now, it is the echo of the ancient lay that has awakened to threaten the existence of our world.
    It must be silenced...at all costs.${prompt}
  8219: You have already uncovered the secret lay of the sleeping gods, I see.${prompt}
  8220: Could this be why the echo has grown so strong...?${prompt}
  8221: |-
    No matter.
    The echo of the ancient ode already resonates throughout our world...${prompt}
  8222: '...silent though it may be to mortal ears.${prompt}'
  8223: It is this echo that, left unchecked, will cast open the door to Paradise...${prompt}
  8224: '...and unravel the very fabric of Vana''diel itself.${prompt}'
  8225: |-
    But what can be done?
    How are we to fight that which can be neither seen nor heard?${prompt}
  8226: Perhaps there is a way...${prompt}
  8227: The shards you brought here were not the only fragments of the crystal to fall from the heavens.${prompt}
  8228: "Perhaps the others hold the answers we seek. \nPerhaps they will reveal to us how to save this world.${prompt}"
  8229: |-
    The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, and the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}...
    We must recover them, and quickly. Before they fall into the wrong hands...${prompt}
  8230: If those nosy Goblins were to stumble across them, one can only imagine what effect the power of the crystal might have...${prompt}
  8231: |-
    I'll be waiting for you here.
    And ${name-player}...you'd better hurry.${prompt}
  8232: With each passing moment, the echo grows stronger, ever closer to drowning out the sound of our very existence...${prompt}
  8233: |-
    (debug flag) Finished Promathia?
    ${selection-lines}
    Nope.
    Sure did!${prompt}
  8234: |-
    There you are, ${name-player}.
    I've been waiting for you.${prompt}
  8235: 'Were you able to recover the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, and ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}?${prompt}'
  8236: Ahhh...wonderful.${prompt}
  8237: |-
    These shards are sure to tell us something.
    Let us see what secrets they hold...${prompt}
  8238: |-
    What's this?
    There is another verse...?${prompt}
  8239: An antiphon, a response to the lay of destruction...?${prompt}
  8240: An undiscovered verse with the power to silence the raging echo...${prompt}
  8241: |-
    A chorus with the power to channel the love, the will to live of all who sing it into a clarion call.
    A call that will cut through the echo of destruction, restoring order from chaos...${prompt}
  8242: An ode to appease the ancient gods... Yes, this is the answer we seek.${prompt}
  8243: You!${prompt}
  8244: |-
    Meddling child!
    Why do you interfere?${prompt}
  8245: |-
    Who do you think you are to defy the will of the Seed Crystal?
    To defy your own fate?${prompt}
  8246: |-
    Hah! The Seed Crystal?
    It's nothing but an echo. A faint shadow of the past--${prompt}
  8247: |-
    But child, do you not see?
    It is the echo of your own beating heart, of your own breath, of every life born to this world since the time of creation.${prompt}
  8248: Within the echo, all are one--as it has been since before the dawn of time.${prompt}
  8249: |-
    The echo of life will resound through the ages.
    It will not be silenced by the likes of you!${prompt}
  8250: |-
    The Seed Crystal...its echo...they did not arise from nothingness...
    They were drawn to this world...by a song...
    A song...that rings out ceaselessly...from within a mother's heart...${prompt}
  8251: |-
    Mortals...do you not see?
    You are dealing...with powers...far beyond your control.${prompt}
  8252: |-
    The “Seed Crystal,” eh?
    So that oversized slab of rock has a name.${prompt}
  8253: |-
    I had a hunch that following that crystal would lead me somewhere.
    Looks like this is where things start to get interesting...${prompt}
  8254: |-
    Well met, ${name-player}.
    I see you've still got a nose for trouble.${prompt}
  8255: Now, what in Altana's good name is going on here?${prompt}
  8256: |-
    And what were those overgrown bean sprouts blathering on about?
    A song within a mother's heart?${prompt}
  8257: "Ah. \nSo you must be Aldo...${prompt}"
  8258: Yes... You have your sister's eyes.${prompt}
  8259: What!?${prompt}
  8260: Boy! What did you say just now!?${prompt}
  8261: Finally we meet...Uncle.${prompt}
  8262: Mother named me Aldo too. After you...${prompt}
  8263: |-
    Just one minute, kid!
    Are you saying your mom is my sister!?${prompt}
  8264: That you're...Emeline's son?${prompt}
  8265: My sister...still lives!?${prompt}
  8266: I'm afraid we've no time to celebrate this family reunion now, Uncle.${prompt}
  8267: We must unearth and release the antiphon...and quickly.${prompt}
  8268: Before the ancient echo reduces our world to so many pieces of shattered crystal.${prompt}
  8269: Luckily, you just may prove to be the key to it all...Uncle Aldo.${prompt}
  8270: Yes. You just might be able to break the resonance between Mother and the Seed Crystal.${prompt}
  8271: |-
    What nonsense is this!? What does Emeline have to do with this so-called Seed Crystal!?
    You expect me to believe this childish fantasy?${prompt}
  8272: |-
    A fantasy? I think not, Uncle.
    No...there can be no doubt.${prompt}
  8273: |-
    Can you not hear it? A prayer of life...
    Yes, this world must be saved...no matter how great the cost.${prompt}
  8274: If you wish to save Mother...${prompt}
  8275: If you care for the sister you once knew, make haste for Fei'Yin.${prompt}
  8276: The servants of the Seed Crystal will not hesitate to put their dark schemes into action.${prompt}
  8277: Hold it right there, boy!${prompt}
  8278: |-
    I must know...where is Emeline!?
    What's been done to her!?${prompt}
  8279: Oh, you'll have your answers soon enough...my dear Uncle.${prompt}
  8280: |-
    What the--? Cursed brat!
    Seed Crystals and ancient songs!? This is all patently absurd!${prompt}
  8281: But if the boy speaks true, and my sister truly still lives...${prompt}
  8282: |-
    For all these years, I thought I had lost you forever that day.
    By the Goddess, I won't let them take you from me again.
    Emeline...${prompt}
  8283: |-
    Fei'Yin, he said?
    I'd best be on my way.${prompt}
  8284: And ${name-player}, I trust you to keep quiet about what you've seen here today.${prompt}
  8285: |-
    And you there, adventurer.
    I don't know who you are or what brings you here with that boy, but I trust you to keep quiet about what you've seen today.${prompt}
  8286: If these unfounded claims of the world's end reached the three nations, we'd have nothing short of mass panic on our hands.${prompt}
  8287: |-
    I intend to uncover what information I can, and suggest that you do the same.
    But until we find out if the boy's words hold water, we're not to speak a word of this--not even to one another.${prompt}
  8288: Until we meet again...
  8289: |-

  11405: |-
    What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo!
    Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!${prompt}
  11406: |-
    We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers.

  11408: |-
    Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo.
    Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom.
    It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!${prompt}
  11409: The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!${prompt}
  11410: |-
    In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign.
    Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.${prompt}
  11411: Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...${prompt}
  11412: |-
    King Kupofried was greatly dismayed.
    How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?${prompt}
  11413: In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.${prompt}
  11414: “Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo,” he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.${prompt}
  11415: |-
    Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin.
    A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?${prompt}
  11416: |-
    We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition.
    We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!${prompt}

    Periapt.${prompt}
  11572: The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called “Voidwalkers.” Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt}
  11573: |-
    Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.
    This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt}
  11574: Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt}
  11575: A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt}
  11576: Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt}
  11577: |-
    Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.
    Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt}
  11578: Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt}
  11579: Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt}
  11580: However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt}
  11581: |-
    When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.
    These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt}
  11582: Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt}
  11583: The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt}
  11584: |-
    Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.
    Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt}
  11585: As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt}
  11586: Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt}
  11587: Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt}
  11588: After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt}
  11589: Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt}
  11590: Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  11591: While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  11592: Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt}
  11593: Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt}
  11594: Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt}
  11595: Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt}
  11596: Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt}
  11597: The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt}
  11598: The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt}
  11599: Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt}
  11600: 'Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt}'

  11602: Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}
  11603: Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.${prompt}
  11604: Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.${prompt}
  11605: As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.${prompt}

    Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul.
    Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.${prompt}
  11696: By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.${prompt}
  11697: 'At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}'
  11698: Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.${prompt}
  11699: That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.${prompt}
  11700: From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.${prompt}
  11701: But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.${prompt}
  11702: The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt}
  11703: |-
    Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all.
    As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.${prompt}
  11704: We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.${prompt}
  11705: 'Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level ${number: 0}. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.${prompt}'
  11706: |-
    Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands.
    For reasons yet to be determined, however, both infusion and enrichment can be safely performed by laymen, provided they're at a planar rift.${prompt}

  12512: 'While reports of Voidwalker encounters vary greatly in content, one thing is certain: the creatures are gaining in strength, a mounting threat that cannot be left unchecked.${prompt}'
  12513: In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning adventurers to lend their aid.${prompt}
  12514: As the nature of Voidwalker battles renders full-scale military operations unfeasible, we have chosen to stake our success on the mobility and versatility of adventurers.${prompt}
  12515: In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning soldiers of the Allied Forces to lend their aid.${prompt}
  12516: To be sure, there're those who question the wisdom of thinning our ranks in the face of the Shadow Lord's armies. But I assure you, friend, the Voidwalker threat is no less real.${prompt}

    These magicked stones are distributed in regular shipments from our Jeuno-based research team.

  12523: That's provided we have any in stock at all. Much time is required in imbuing them with requisite powers.${prompt}
  12524: The Voidwatch is an organization that exists for the sole purpose of protecting the world from extradimensional invaders we call “Voidwalkers.”${prompt}
  12525: Recognizing the graveness of this threat, the nations of the Middle Lands joined together in common cause and formed the Voidwatch.${prompt}
  12526: Helming the organization is the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, with the remaining three nations contributing resources for its operation.${prompt}
  12527: 'Possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt}'
  12528: It can be earned only through loyal service to your nation, and thus serves as a testimonial for your prowess.${prompt}
  12529: You would do well to obtain one if you haven't already done so.${prompt}
  12530: Affiliation with the Allied Forces of Altana is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt}
  12531: In other words, you must belong to the armed forces of one of the three nations.${prompt}
  12532: The enlistment procedure varies depending on nation. Those wishing to obtain a recommendation letter should pay visit to one of the military encampments surrounding Jeuno.${prompt}
  12533: When you battle a Voidwalker, you must do so as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of the dimension who has harnessed the powers of the voidstone and stratum abyssite.${prompt}
  12534: Bereft of these two objects, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.${prompt}
  12535: However, there are a few points all budding Voidwatchers should bear in mind.${prompt}
  12536: Most crucial of all, the extradimensional nature of being a Voidwatcher renders you isolated and unable to receive help from the outside world.${prompt}
  12537: Scientists attribute this to the dimensional misalignment that occurs. As people are ordinarily unable to see Voidwalkers, so too are they unable to see you.${prompt}
  12538: But you needn't concern yourself with the hows and whys of such matters. It would behoove you far more to become familiar with the workings of the “existential spectrum.”${prompt}
  12539: |-
    You see, each dimension is composed of an existential spectrum to which all things within are aligned.
    In turn, the spectrum is formed of five lights: blue, red, yellow, green, and white.${prompt}
  12540: The alignment of these lights between Voidwalker and Voidwatcher plays an important role in our efforts.${prompt}
  12541: To elaborate, the act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning ourselves to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  12542: Now, while Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with these creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  12543: Compensating measures, however, have been developed to allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe.${prompt}
  12544: One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items,” while another entails performing certain actions against the enemy.${prompt}
  12545: Both methods aim to manipulate the alignment value of individual lights to various ends.${prompt}
  12546: All five lights influence the contents of the treasure chest which appears at the successful end of battle.${prompt}
  12547: Our researchers have succeeded in determining what manner of benefits are associated with each light.${prompt}
  12548: For instance, improving blue spectral alignment is known to produce greater quantities of spoils.${prompt}
  12549: In contrast, manipulating red spectral alignment reportedly enhances the quality of individual items--potions becoming hi-potions, and so forth.${prompt}
  12550: Yellow and green, on the other hand, influence experience gain and cruor yield respectively.${prompt}
  12551: If you wish to know more about the curious red substance we call cruor, you need but ask.${prompt}
  12552: |-
    Lastly, we have white spectral alignment, which is unique even in this company.
    It has been determined to affect the appearance of transdimensional objects such as atmacite and periapt.${prompt}
  12553: Research regarding these artifacts is still ongoing.${prompt}
  12554: Lastly, be reassured that there're no known negative effects of manipulating spectral alignment. We unreservedly encourage all Voidwatch operatives to endeavor towards maximum alignment.${prompt}
  12555: Ascent items are unique objects that can be used to manipulate the spectral alignment of corresponding lights in the existential spectrum.${prompt}
  12556: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are representative of such items.
    They're the pride and joy of our Jeuno-based research team, who'd have folk believe they're the greatest inventions since airships.${prompt}
  12557: (Just between you and me, though, it is Far Eastern scientists that pioneered the technology they're based upon.)${prompt}
  12558: They're not the only means by which we manipulate spectral alignment, mind you. Similar results can be achieved by performing specific actions against the enemy.${prompt}
  12559: Truth be told, much is still shrouded in mystery. What actions will produce the desired effect is something you will have to discover for yourself through trial and error.${prompt}
  12560: Defeating a Voidwalker will cause a mysterious pyxis to emerge at the selfsame planar rift whence the creature was felled.${prompt}
  12561: 'Such riftworn pyxides exhibit a most peculiar characteristic: the content they bear reportedly changes depending on who glimpses within.${prompt}'
  12562: |-
    Our scientists conjecture that this is due to some trick of spectral alignment. As with numerous other mysteries surrounding Voidwalkers, however, I highly doubt they have even an inkling of understanding.
    But I digress...${prompt}
  12563: Only one combatant need possess a voidstone for all party or alliance members to do battle with a Voidwalker. Of the other squad members only stratum abyssite is required.${prompt}
  12564: |-
    As always seems to be the case, however, there is a catch.
    Pyxides have been observed to yield less spoils for combatants without a voidstone of their own.${prompt}
  12565: It scarce needs be said, but it would be to your benefit to have both the aforementioned items readied before taking on a Voidwalker.${prompt}
  12566: |-
    Lastly, a warning: pyxides will eventually vanish if left untouched overlong.
    Our scientists have put forth the theory of normalizing spatial dissonance, but you needn't concern yourself with their mumbo-jumbo.${prompt}
  12567: Just see to it that your hard-earned spoils are claimed in good time, and things will be rosy for all involved.${prompt}
  12568: 'The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is a magicked object produced by the Voidwatch''s Jeuno-based research wing.${prompt}'
  12569: Its innocuous appearance belies the immense power it holds...the power to render Voidwalkers visible to its bearer.${prompt}
  12570: The stone achieves this feat by realigning our existential spectrum to that of the creature.${prompt}
  12571: I shall explain the process in layman's terms for your benefit. No need to thank me--I merely perform my duty.${prompt}
  12572: I want you to visualize two canvases, each the same distance from the other. Yes, as two separate objects are normally wont to be.${prompt}
  12573: Imagine you and I standing on one of the canvases--what else does one do with a canvas but stand on it, yes?${prompt}
  12574: Now, imagine Voidwalkers standing on the other canvas, doing whatever it is Voidwalkers do. Destroying things and behaving with utter impropriety, no doubt.${prompt}
  12575: |-
    Being on two different canvases, it follows that we cannot touch the Voidwalkers, let alone see them.
    Actually, that doesn't explain why we can't see the Voidwalkers...unless it's a magical canvas they're on that makes all things upon it invisible! Yes, that'll serve!${prompt}
  12576: And this brings us full circle back to the voidstone. I want you to think of it as a magical paintbrush that we use to...grapple ourselves over to the Voidwalkers' canvas. Thence the fighting begins.${prompt}
  12577: |-
    I trust you now have a rudimentary understanding of the process. That's all you need, really.
    Leave the fractal geometry to the fractal geometrists, I always say.${prompt}
  12578: |-
    As long as you remember the canvas and the paintbrush--that's the voidstone--you cannot go astray.
    Now, to apprise you of more practical matters...${prompt}
  12579: Twenty hours (Earth time) is required to produce a stone and imbue it with the necessary magicks, although word is that this may be shortened as research progresses.${prompt}
  12580: |-
    Mind you, this isn't the only variety of stone you'll be needing.
    There exists another: stratum abyssite.${prompt}
  12581: |-
    Whereas the voidstone serves as a power source, acting as a compass for channeling that power is stratum abyssite.
    Only by using the two in conjunction can we achieve our objectives.${prompt}
  12582: |-
    Are you familiar with ${color: 5}voiddust${color: 1}?
    Put simply, it is a granular substance from which voidstones may be fabricated.${prompt}
  12583: |-
    As I explained, significant time is required to produce a voidstone from scratch.
    Provide me with voiddust, however, and I can fashion a stone for you in short order.${prompt}
  12584: |-
    The same comrades of ours who stock ascent items may also furnish you with voiddust.
    Why do they not fabricate the stones themselves, or deliver the dust directly to me?
    Shush! The Voidwatch works in mysterious ways, and it would behoove you to inquire no further.${prompt}
  12585: |-
    At any rate, should you manage to obtain any ${color: 5}voiddust${color: 1} in your travels, you need only return here and trade it to me.
    Simple enough, wouldn't you say?${prompt}
  12586: Furthermore, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.${prompt}
  12587: Based on the evolutionary state of your stratum abyssite, the Voidwatch will direct you to a suitable operation area.${prompt}
  12588: If you wish to have your stone analyzed, simply present it to an atma refiner.${prompt}
  12589: |-
    Planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space--have manifested across the land.
    The Voidwalker hordes roam beyond, unchecked and ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt}
  12590: By invoking the power of stratum abyssite, it is possible to battle the fell creatures as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of our dimension.${prompt}
  12591: Those also possessed of a voidstone will find their Voidwatcher experience greatly enhanced.${prompt}
  12592: Alone, however, stratum abyssite serves no purpose; only when used in conjunction with a voidstone can its powers be unleashed.${prompt}
  12593: Hence, at least one member of your squad--be it party or alliance--must possess a voidstone in order to arrange a confrontation with a Voidwalker.${prompt}
  12594: Keep this fact in mind at all times.${prompt}
  12595: It is not known when the planar rifts first manifested. Some say they've always been there, while others claim recent events have triggered their appearance.${prompt}
  12596: If only we could return to the past, perhaps we could shed some light upon this mystery...${prompt}
  12597: Obtainable by defeating Voidwalkers, cruor is an energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt}
  12598: While appearing to be some manner of mineral, detailed analysis has revealed that cruor is in fact organic.${prompt}
  12599: |-
    As far as our researchers can tell, however, it's inanimate like most well-behaved plants.
    There's no fear of cruor suddenly springing to life in your palms.${prompt}
  12600: Being supremely pleasing to the eyes, cruor might have adorned the display cases of many a jewelry shop during peacetime. Unfortunately, the age demands that its unique properties be put to more practical uses.${prompt}
  12601: |-
    Namely, the infusion and enrichment of atmacite.
    If you wish to learn about these two processes, you need but ask an atmacite refiner, our experts on such matters.${prompt}
  12602: As cruor is a vital aspect of our operations, the Voidwatch is always looking to procure more. Should you have any excess cruor, we would be glad to take it off your hands and offer you useful items in exchange.${prompt}
  12603: Abyssite is the name given to a mysterious stone that assumes various forms and colors, the roles they serve likewise manifold in nature.${prompt}
  12604: Of the copious varieties thus far discovered, there exist those called “periapt”--lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt}
  12605: Defeating a Voidwalker is known to yield periapt on very rare occasions. Serve the Voidwatch earnestly, however, and you will surely have one to call your own.${prompt}
