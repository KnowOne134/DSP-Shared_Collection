  6727: What!? You want me to look for a ring? Oh, my! You ask the impossible.${prompt}
  6728: Oswald's ring, eh? I'd sure like to help him out, but there's no way I could find a ring on the bottom of the sea.${prompt}

  6762: One day I discovered that stone monuments bearing his words lie in various places all over the world.${prompt}

  6768: Is that right? Well, that's too bad. Come back if you ever have a change of heart.${prompt}
  6769: At last! You've done it! You have my warmest thanks. Here, this is a reward for your effort. Don't expect too much from this old man, though, hehe.${prompt}

  6780: Yeah? Who the heck are you? If you wanna be somebody, get some more experience under your belt!${prompt}

  6788: Me? Yes, I'm doing fine, thanks. But my girlfriend's just not feeling well at all.${prompt}
  6789: I don't think she's sick, so I'm just having her eat nutritious things and hoping she starts feeling better soon.${prompt}
  6790: I asked the cook at the inn for some help. He said he'd need some special ingredients, but there's no way I could get them!${prompt}
  6791: You helped me out so much before, so maybe you could do just one more favor for me.${prompt}

  6796: This is all I have to give. Please, take it. You're our savior!${prompt}
  6797: Oh, hello there. Thanks for helping me out then. My girlfriend was very grateful.${prompt}
  6798: But she still isn't back to her old self. So, I started thinking some more...${prompt}
  6799: I thought that maybe the real culprit is food itself! Once you eat something, it's gone, right?${prompt}
  6800: And that's when I came up with this great idea for my next present...but I'll need a little help getting it. ${prompt}
  6801: Well, what do you say? Could I call upon you for yet another favor?${prompt}
  6802: Oh, I see. But I really would prefer you! If you ever find the time to help me, please come back.${prompt}
  6803: I know I might seem stubborn, but you're my only hope.${prompt}
  6804: I heard about how you found the ring. You caught so many fish, and finally you found it inside one of them, right?${prompt}
  6805: 'Well, since you''re such a fine fisherman, I wanted to ask you to find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} for me.${prompt}'
  6806: 'They say that ${item-plural: 0[2]} yield pearls. If I find one, I''m planning on having a boneworker fix it up for me.${prompt}'

  6808: 'But without ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, I can''t even begin. I wish I knew where they could be caught. If I knew someone who could tell me.${prompt}'
  6809: I have a feeling you'll figure something out. Please, do what you can.${prompt}
  6810: 'Now what? You''re looking for ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}? Don''t you have anything better to do?${prompt}'
  6811: 'I hear you can find ${item-plural: 0[2]} in sandy places like Valkurm and Buburimu. Heck, get a chocobo to dig some up on the coast.${prompt}'
  6812: 'Lemme guess. You want to get some pearls from the ${item-plural: 0[2]}, right? Well, it takes time, but it''s a lot cheaper than buying them.${prompt}'
  6813: Goodness, you found one! Thank you so much! Here, this is for you.${prompt}
  6814: You're so fantastic! My girlfriend and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts.${prompt}
  6815: Oh, hello again. Thanks for all you've done. My girlfriend was quite impressed with the necklace! The thing is, she said something rather odd.${prompt}
  6816: She said, “Thanks for the gift, but what I want the most is you here next to me.”${prompt}
  6817: I didn't know what to say. Nobody's ever said such things to me!${prompt}
  6818: Thanks to you, I feel like I've learned what's really important.${prompt}
  6819: Now I know that she's the one. Thank you so much for all the help!${prompt}
  6820: Oh, hello again. I can't believe I ever lost that ring. I won't let that happen again.${prompt}
  6821: These days we traveling merchants fight for our survival. But we can't just give up our livelihood. After all, things weren't always like this.${prompt}
  6822: I've been all over Vana'diel, but the inn here is my favorite. It's not the most luxurious place in the world, but I love the relaxed atmosphere.${prompt}
  6823: I hear about you a lot. People say you do much for Selbina.${prompt}
  6824: I speak for the whole town when I say thank you. Thank you.${prompt}
  6825: Thing is, the turtlebacks are on the move. Word is they're up to no good.${prompt}
  6826: I'm itching to go smash them, but I can't leave the town defenseless.${prompt}
  6827: Maybe you could go instead. What do you say?${prompt}
  6828: Thanks. The turtlebacks often strike merchants headed to our village. Another caravan was attacked just the other day.${prompt}
  6829: They fled, but two of them were taken prisoner.${prompt}
  6830: The turtlebacks prowling outside came from Beadeaux. We think the merchants are held captive there.${prompt}
  6831: Their names are Evrard and Serafin.${prompt}
  6832: They say that the turtlebacks keep prisoners locked up tight. Somewhere in Beadeaux there should be such a place.${prompt}
  6833: The merchants who made it here said that they were different from other turtlebacks. I hope that helps.${prompt}
  6834: I hate asking others to do our job, but please, rescue the two captives. Their families need them.${prompt}
  6835: Oh? Pity... I hoped you would say yes.${prompt}
  6836: W-we're saved! I thought they were going to kill us! Thank you! ${prompt}
  6837: Please, take our things back to Selbina for us. We can run well enough on our own.${prompt}
  6838: We're so glad you came. As long as you carry our packs for us, we can watch the enemy as we make our way to safety.${prompt}
  6839: Once back in Selbina, give our packs to Thunder Hawk. He'll make sure we get them. Thank you, brave one!${prompt}
  6840: Ah, perfect! We just arrived as well.${prompt}
  6841: Whew, I'm so glad we're free! We owe our lives to you!${prompt}
  6842: We're thankful enough you're safe. We apologize we couldn't help you.${prompt}
  6843: But you did well. Thank you! This is for your service.${prompt}
  6844: You saved our lives, friend! Let us thank you as well. Here, take this!${prompt}
  6845: Oh, it's you again. There is nothing more I can teach you. Now go, and may Altana smile upon you.${prompt}
  6846: What? Oh... Hello, child. I'm just a feeble old man. Go and leave me be.${prompt}
  6847: So, little ${choice-player-gender}[boy/girl], you want to be an adventurer, do you? Well, you've got a long way to go, I reckon.${prompt}
  6848: I am glad that you seek my wisdom, child, but still you are too callow.${prompt}
  6849: I, too, once took up arms for honor and country. But it was all in vain.${prompt}
  6850: I helped defend the nation. I tasted glory. But behind their smiles people grew jealous. I lost my family, and my comrades deserted me.${prompt}
  6851: Soon I realized that all I did, everything I fought for was in vain. I left the ranks for good.${prompt}
  6852: But of late the beastmen rise in challenge. Again, many may lose dear friends and family to the storms of war.${prompt}
  6853: I thought then of preventing such tragedy from happening again. Fortunately, an answer came to me.${prompt}
  6854: I decided to teach my survival techniques to brave youths like yourself.${prompt}
  6855: If you wish to learn them, you must prove your worthiness to me.${prompt}

    Are you ready?

  6862: 'Well done! Now for your final test. Bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Then you will gain what you desire.${prompt}'
  6863: Splendid. As promised, I will now instruct you in a most precious skill. I call it a “support job.” Listen well to learn its secrets.${prompt}
  6864: Support jobs are undertaken anywhere you normally change jobs. And you must already be proficient in a job before you can declare it your support job.${prompt}
  6865: 'Furthermore, the effective level of your support job can never exceed ${color: 5}half${color: 1} that of your main job. Also, since it is merely a support job, you''ll never advance through experience.${prompt}'
  6866: I shall give an example. Let us say you have attained level 20 as a warrior and level 10 as a white mage. You would obviously declare your main job warrior, and your support job white mage.${prompt}
  6867: In this example, you fight as a warrior of 20 levels and as a white mage 10 levels lower. Thus, you would be performing both jobs to their maximum potential.${prompt}
  6868: In contrast, if you had declared white mage your main job and warrior your support job, things would be very different!${prompt}
  6869: Since you would have only 10 levels of experience as a white mage, your potential as a warrior would be reduced to half that of your main job. Thus, 5! Not a wise decision, is it?${prompt}
  6870: Similarly, you wouldn't want to make your support job something you've never done before. If your support job level is less than half that of your main job, your undeveloped skills would make not a difference. Remember this well!${prompt}
  6871: I recommend you choose a support job that covers your main job's weaknesses, or one that enhances its strengths.${prompt}
  6872: I realize there is much to remember, my pupil.${prompt}

  6926: 'I''ll need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Now, make haste!${prompt}'
  6927: Where are those ingredients? I cannot start without them!${prompt}
  6928: Hmph. So you found them, did you? Fine! Come see me tomorrow. It should be ready by then.${prompt}
  6929: What now? It's not done yet! Don't worry, my dishes are always ready on time.${prompt}
  6930: Done! Now, take it and get out of here!${prompt}
  6931: What now? It's done, so leave me in peace!${prompt}
  6932: Oh, you again. I hope you liked the dish.${prompt}
  6933: What, you again? Well, I'm not about to chastise you. Very well, I'll have a look. Give me a moment.${prompt}
  6934: It's true he has improved. But still he fails to grasp the basics of cooking. There's more to it than haggling over ingredients!${prompt}
  6935: Everything has a foundation, not just cooking. Making things good on the outside is easy; it is what's inside that counts.${prompt}
  6936: Only when one has understood the basics can they make the inside good. Amateurs hurry the most; too often they focus on appearance.${prompt}
  6937: Rycharde is the perfect example. He simply isn't the prodigy I hoped for.${prompt}
  6938: He may be my son, but he'll never be a chef in my eyes. Well, that's a lecture not meant for you.${prompt}
  6939: Are you heading back now? Please, give this to him. Tell him it's my reply. If he doesn't understand what it means, then that will be it.${prompt}
  6940: You gave it to him, did you not? I do hope he understood.${prompt}
  6941: 'You gave it to him, did you not? Back when I started teaching him how to cook, I often had him use ${item-plural: 0[2]} in his dishes.${prompt}'
  6942: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} come cheaply of late. But that doesn''t rule them out as ingredients.${prompt}'
  6943: You could also use pricey ingredients, and even though your utensils might be mediocre, your food will still come out tasting fine.${prompt}
  6944: Delicious food is not made from fancy spices or cutlery. Nor does it come from any methodical analysis.${prompt}
  6945: Indeed, nothing is more crucial than the desire to satisfy others with good food, and thinking up ways to do it.${prompt}
  6946: If my son could only realize that, there may still be some hope for him.${prompt}
  6947: Cooking is a complex art, but the basics are as clear as day. I suppose that goes for just about anything.${prompt}
  6948: Never forget to give thanks at each meal. The hands of many work hard to bring us sustenance.${prompt}
  6949: Hello there. I'm Mathilde, and my daddy runs this guild shop.${prompt}
  6950: We only sell goods he hand-picks himself. So rest easy knowing you're getting quality merchandise every time you shop!${prompt}
  6951: Why, hello. My daughter and I are holding the fort again. Oh, that husband of mine's always out watching his precious sheep.${prompt}
  6952: My daughter Mathilde married about five years ago. She gave us a grandson, and he's such a good little boy!${prompt}
  6953: I always tell my husband how lucky we are!${prompt}
  6954: But you see, Mathilde is adopted. Everyone says we get along better than most real families, though.${prompt}
  6955: My husband found her out on a trade route when she was just a child, and brought her back home with him. I can't believe twenty years could go by so quickly!${prompt}
  6956: The thing is, she had no memory of her past. She couldn't even remember her name. She didn't seem hurt anywhere, so she must have been through some terrible ordeal. Poor little thing...${prompt}
  6957: My husband thinks her family was preyed upon by monsters, and she was the only survivor. The whole world was at war then, and such tragedies were commonplace.${prompt}
  6958: She still remembers nothing about those times. Nothing, except for a certain boy's name. He must have been a very important person to her.${prompt}
  6959: Hello again. We have lots of fine things in today. Take your time!${prompt}
  6960: I'm home!${prompt}
  6961: Hi, Aldo.${prompt}
  6962: Mom, look! I found this on the beach. It's for you!${prompt}
  6963: What a pretty seashell! Thank you.${prompt}
  6964: Ashtia's waiting for me. Gotta go!${prompt}
  6965: Take care!${prompt}
  6966: Always do!${prompt}
  6967: I'll get one for you too, Grandma!${prompt}
  6968: Why thanks, Aldo. That would be nice.${prompt}
  6969: He comes and goes like a cyclone, that boy!${prompt}
  6970: My little treasure, that Aldo. Where could my other precious Aldo be? He could be out there somewhere...${prompt}
  6971: 'No, he must be out there. He''s leading a happy life somewhere. Look at us: we live so far apart under the very same sky.${prompt}'
  6972: Good to see you. Once you reach my age, you'll realize that you have to work or you'll never get out of bed.${prompt}
  6973: You've met Aldo, haven't you? Isn't he such a nice little boy? I always tell my husband how blessed we are for both a child and a grandchild!${prompt}
  6974: You want something? I've been a fisherman here since the dawn of time! Of course, I have a little side-business, too.${prompt}
  6975: If you want to learn about fishing, just ask Gabwaleid. He doesn't look it, but he knows quite a bit. I taught him everything! Haha!${prompt}
  6976: What can I do for you? I'm Gabwaleid. Someday I want to be a real fisherman like Zaldon.${prompt}
  6977: You have to pick the right bait depending on what fish you want to catch. Otherwise it's all a waste!${prompt}
  6978: You have to be aware of the time of day and the weather, too. Try to fish at the best time and under the best weather.${prompt}
  6979: You'll catch different fish depending on where you are. Of course, there's a big difference between fishing from the river and from the sea.${prompt}
  6980: Oh, and one more thing... It hardly ever happens, but once in a while something...unexpected may bite. Be careful!${prompt}
  6981: There's nothing better than fishing from the ship. There are so many unique things to catch. The time just flies!${prompt}
  6982: There's nothing wrong with bait, but I go for lures, myself. You can keep using them till your line breaks or your pole snaps. Of course, they cost more.${prompt}
  6983: Say, have you heard? Pirates roam the seas between Selbina and Mhaura. You watch out. One never knows when they'll strike next!${prompt}
  6984: Orcs to the north, turtlebacks to the south... With the ocean now swarming with corsairs, our village is the only haven!${prompt}
  6985: Been to Jeuno yet? They say that none may question the worth of a man who's walked to Jeuno.${prompt}
  6986: We work the docks. Trade ships couldn't sail without us, but I guess we'd starve without them, too.${prompt}
  6987: Keep a sharp eye out for pirates. Word is they strike using uncanny powers. They say it's the truth, believe it or not.${prompt}
  6988: I hear many Humes in Bastok look down on us Galka.${prompt}
  6989: Nobody is like that here in Selbina. Here, race is no issue. All that matters is an open mind.${prompt}
  6990: Our town is equally far from all the great nations. You can go to Bastok, you can go to San d'Oria--all roads are just as risky.${prompt}
  6991: My husband's out fishing. Lots of good fish bite here.${prompt}
  6992: We're playing hide-and-go-seek. I wonder where the other three are...${prompt}
  6993: Oh, you found me first! I knew this would be a bad hiding place.${prompt}
  6994: Whoa, you scared me! Please, don't tell them I'm here!${prompt}
  6995: I'd hide further back, but there's a scary man there. I'm so afraid they'll find me here!${prompt}
  6996: Ha! He'll never find me here! Oh, wait... He is really good at finding us...${prompt}
  6997: This is the mayor's mansion. Our mayor is a good man. Go inside and say hello.${prompt}
  6998: The Valkurm Dunes is Selbina's territory, but our militia is too few to patrol it. It is sad, but you adventurers must keep the sands safe.${prompt}
  6999: Oh, you again. Thanks for all you've done for us. We need all the help we can get.${prompt}
  7000: No reports of trouble recently. For us, no news is good news!${prompt}
  7001: Our village may be small, but so many stop here to rest on the road between Bastok and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7002: Sorry, the station is for militia personnel only.${prompt}
  7003: If you're heading outside, remember that there's safety in numbers. Gather people of different talents to cover any weaknesses.${prompt}
  7004: If you're here for the ship, the docks are straight down the stairs from here.${prompt}
  7005: I'm Velema. I keep watch over the docks.${prompt}
  7006: Is there a problem? See the mayor if you have any questions.${prompt}
  7007: Visitors often ask me how to find the mines of Palborough. What could they want from its dark and twisting tunnels?${prompt}
  7008: Have you visited the mayor's office yet? That Naillina knows so much about everything!${prompt}
  7009: I've noticed an awfully suspicious-looking fellow visit town recently. Have you seen him?${prompt}
  7010: Isacio used to be a knight a long time ago. I wonder what brought him here...${prompt}
  7011: Zaldon has all kinds of tales to tell. But he's so stubborn your head will ache!${prompt}
  7012: Gabwaleid actually knows a lot about fishing. He'll teach you whatever you need to know.${prompt}
  7013: The inn's cook, Valgeir, whips up some fantastic dishes. I wish I had enough money to try one!${prompt}
  7014: Mayor Abelard is more like a scientist than a politician. He's into some kind of research.${prompt}
  7015: Vuntar's an earnest worker. Come to think of it, he's been working here as long as I can remember...${prompt}
  7016: Melyon is so proud of his sheep, isn't he? He's thought up interesting names for them.${prompt}
  7017: Romeo is always thinking up new ways to make money. And I think he's pretty good at it, too.${prompt}
  7018: My name's Manfried and I'm a deputy along with Flandiace. Velema's our sergeant, and the three of us serve under Thunder Hawk.${prompt}
  7019: Hello!${prompt}
  7020: Welcome to the Shepherd's Muster.${prompt}
  7021: Herminia carries a wide selection of goods, and Torapiont is always available for your weaponry needs.${prompt}
  7022: This inn's got the best menu anywhere, thanks to the master chef. He's been cooking for ages, and I doubt anyone comes close.${prompt}

  7372: There may not be a need for that melody at all.${prompt}
  7373: |-
    I...!?
    Why would that be?${prompt}
  7374: Once Lord Bahamut sees Prishe's magicite, it may be enough to convince him. And...${prompt}
  7375: And we would not want to lose the Star of Tavnazia...${prompt}
  7376: |-
    ...?
    What do you mean?${prompt}
  7377: |-
    ...
    There is something I would like to ask Prishe.
    Ulmia, let us meet with her in Jeuno.${prompt}
  7378: ${name-player}, please go on ahead to Bastok.${prompt}
  7379: '　　 ${wait-animation: 1}'
  7380: I'm Abelard, mayor of this village.${prompt}
  7381: You say you're looking for Lady Leffine?${prompt}
  7382: You're not the first to ask that question, but I'm sorry to say there's no one here by that name.${prompt}
  7383: Even if you've been requested to do so, you shouldn't be poking around into other people's pasts.${prompt}
  7384: |-
    What's that?
    So why am I trying to find out about Gwynham Ironheart, you ask?${prompt}
  7385: Sure, I've been doing research into Ironheart's past, but...${prompt}
  7386: |-
    That's not the same thing, ${choice-player-gender}[sonny/lass].
    I haven't got the slightest interest in his private life.${prompt}
  7387: I already know all there is to know about him, in any case.${prompt}
  7388: |-
    Have you heard of Lord Torresapet B Ordelle?
    It was feared he would die a demented death in Ordelle's Caves before he completed the map of those twisted tunnels.${prompt}
  7389: He gathered the facts about Gwynham Ironheart's life into a single volume. I have the book right there.${prompt}
  7390: "It's just that... \nBefore that book came into my possession, Gwynham's daughter, Enid, tore out several pages and threw them away.${prompt}"
  7391: I'm curious as to what was written on those pages, but I suppose there's a reason Enid removed them in the first place.${prompt}
  7392: |-
    I guess I should respect that.
    Besides, I doubt anyone could find them anyway...${prompt}
  7393: |-
    Th-these are the missing pages!
    Where did you find them!?${prompt}
  7394: They were left inside Ordelle's Caves...?${prompt}
  7395: If somebody left these pages on purpose, then we have a duty to read them. Seems that Enid didn't throw them away after all.${prompt}
  7396: |-
    Hm?
    If I'm going to read these pages, then I should tell you where to find Lady Leffine?${prompt}
  7397: |-
    Fair enough.
    As did the great Gwynham Ironheart, Lady Leffine passed away many years ago.${prompt}
  7398: |-
    However, her son, Louverance, grew up to become a fine young man.
    Last I heard, he joined the Royal Knights of San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7399: |-
    I haven't seen him visit his mother's grave lately, though.
    Has something happened to him, I wonder.${prompt}
  7400: Speaking of which, there's another thing that's been bugging me.${prompt}
  7401: Earlier, I had another visitor looking for Louverance.${prompt}
  7402: It was a young Hume lady. Made some mention of Atarefaunet's Band.${prompt}
  7403: In any case, she left Selbina after discovering Lady Leffine was no longer with us.${prompt}
  7404: |-
    Is that all you wanted to know?
    Now if you don't mind, I'll get to reading these pages you retrieved.${prompt}
  7405: |-
    A girl by the name of Sanctia?
    Yes, I seem to recall a young lady blowing into town quite a while back, and then blowing straight back out.
    You've missed her, I'm afraid.${prompt}
  7406: |-
    Didn't I tell you this already?
    It was a young Hume girl that mentioned Atarefaunet's Band, remember?${prompt}
  7407: She said she was looking for some bounty hunter that had crossed that group of merciless cutthroats.${prompt}
  7408: Talk around town says that Louverance was searching for the very same man...${prompt}
  7409: She wanted to meet with someone that lived here a long time ago.${prompt}
  7410: Seems she meant to ask him about some bounty hunter he was looking for...${prompt}
  7411: |-
    Hm? The young lady was determined to find her way to the Tavnazian Archipelago?
    And you think she went to one of the caves in the Valkurm Dunes?${prompt}
  7412: We've had a warning from a high-ranking Jeunoan official not to go anywhere near the vortex in that cave.${prompt}
  7413: |-
    Rumors say that travelers drawn into its depths are never heard from again.
    You might be too late to save your friend.${prompt}
  7414: Did the young lady really go into that cave in the Valkurm Dunes?${prompt}
  7415: She's either extremely brave or extremely foolish to try and reach Tavnazia through that vortex.${prompt}
  7416: I've got me a painting on the way from an artist named Angelica.${prompt}
  7417: She's pretty well known among adventurers, so I can't wait to see her work.${prompt}
  7418: I've really gone and landed myself in it this time...${prompt}
  7419: I've got to... No, I can't. This is awful!${prompt}
  7420: Oh, sorry. I didn't see you there. I was just thinking.${prompt}
  7421: Hey, would you happen to be an adventurer?${prompt}
  7422: I knew it!${prompt}
  7423: If you have a moment, could you listen to what I have to say?${prompt}
  7424: |-
    Listen to Diederik's problems?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure.
    I'm busy right now.${prompt}
  7425: Oh, thank you! I was starting to get desperate!${prompt}
  7426: Well, be on with your work, then. Sorry for bothering you!${prompt}
  7427: I've been working knots in my stomach worrying about this...${prompt}
  7428: Anyway, I guess I'd better start from the beginning.${prompt}
  7429: The name's Diederik. I'm currently working as a middleman to fulfill my customers' needs.${prompt}
  7430: The other day, one of my clients, an old man in Bastok, said he wanted a painting. So I put in an order with a painter from Windurst.${prompt}
  7431: Her name was...Angelica, I think it was. She seems to be rather well known among adventurers.${prompt}
  7432: Anyway, I picked up the finished painting and everything seemed to be going fine...${prompt}
  7433: That is, until my ship was attacked by pirates.${prompt}
  7434: We were lucky that no one on board was harmed. But afterwards, I couldn't find the painting anywhere.${prompt}
  7435: I'm supposed to deliver it soon, though, and it puts me in a sweat just thinking about it!${prompt}
  7436: Not only that, but my client is a cranky old man who'll string me up by the ears if he doesn't get what he wants! I can't face that!${prompt}
  7437: He's not going to let me off easy after losing his precious painting.${prompt}
  7438: Even explaining what happened wouldn't do any good with such a sour person.${prompt}
  7439: That's why I can't go to him. I don't know what I'd say! I was about to go back to Angelica and see if she would redo the painting for me...${prompt}
  7440: '...but I can''t tell her, either! She''s so passionate and loves her craft so much, I''m afraid I''d break down if I saw the disappointment on her face when I told her I lost the painting.${prompt}'
  7441: You see, I'm hopeless. I can't carry this burden alone!${prompt}
  7442: Hey! You're an adventurer, so I bet you know Angelica, don't you?${prompt}
  7443: You even modeled for one of her paintings? Excellent!${prompt}
  7444: I bet she would listen to you if you asked her to redo a painting...${prompt}
  7445: Hey! I just got a brilliant idea! Why don't you go and ask Angelica to redo the painting?${prompt}
  7446: You just heard why I couldn't go! You're my only option!${prompt}
  7447: You're her friend, so of course she'll listen to you!${prompt}
  7448: Not that I have the courage to face that old scrooge alone, either...${prompt}
  7449: Oh hey, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7450: Hey, ${name-player}, what are you doing here?${prompt}
  7451: '...${name-player}?${prompt}'
  7452: Greetings, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7453: Oh, it's you, ${name-player}.${prompt}

  7459: Greetings, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7460: Hm? ${name-player}?${prompt}
  7461: This a friend of yours?${prompt}
  7462: Yeah, sometimes ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] and I go on adventures together. So what's up? I miss something?${prompt}
  7463: Of course! ${name-player} and I are always up for an adventure together! Hey, what were you guys just talking about?${prompt}
  7464: You might say that. Anyway, what were you just talking about?${prompt}
  7465: ${name-player} and I occasionally adventure together. Were you discussing important matters?${prompt}
  7466: We adventure together sometimes. What were you two talking about just now? Sounded serious...${prompt}
  7467: Yeah, we're sort of like adventuring partners. Did I butt in on an important discussion?${prompt}
  7468: Yes, we sometimes adventure together. Anyway, is something up?${prompt}
  7469: Yeah! We like to go on adventures together! Hey, what were you guys talking about a second ago?${prompt}
  7470: Yes, ${name-player} and I occasionally adventure together. Anyway, what were you just talking about?${prompt}
  7471: Yep, we sometimes go on adventures together! Um, what were you just talking about?${prompt}
  7472: ${name-player} and I occasionally adventure together. Were you discussing important matters?${prompt}
  7473: ${name-player} and I occasionally journey together. It appears I interrupted your conversation. Carry on.${prompt}
  7474: Well, actually, I'm in a bit of a fix. I'd appreciate it if you could hear me out, too.${prompt}
  7475: Losing the painting on top of getting attacked by pirates? That's rough.${prompt}
  7476: You got attacked by pirates and lost the painting? What bad luck!${prompt}
  7477: So you lost the painting to pirates. Hm, not your lucky day.${prompt}
  7478: I see. You must have been disappointed to lose the painting to pirates.${prompt}
  7479: Pirates attacked your ship, and took your painting? Oh no!${prompt}
  7480: |-
    Having the painting taken by pirates like that...
    I can't imagine how frustrated you must have felt.${prompt}
  7481: You got attacked by pirates and lost the painting? That's not good.${prompt}
  7482: You got attacked by pirates and lost the painting? Oh, that's too bad!${prompt}
  7483: So you lost the painting to pirates. Lady Luck smiles upon you not.${prompt}
  7484: You got attacked by pirates? And lost the painting? I'm sooo sorry!${prompt}
  7485: I see. You must have been disappointed to lose the painting to pirates.${prompt}
  7486: So the pirates went so far as to single out your painting. It seems you chose the wrong day to be at sea.${prompt}
  7487: If ${name-player}'s okay with it, I'd like to go with ${choice-player-gender}[him/her].${prompt}
  7488: If ${name-player} doesn't mind, I'd also like to help!${prompt}
  7489: If ${name-player} doesn't mind, I suppose I should join ${choice-player-gender}[him/her].${prompt}
  7490: I suppose I should accompany ${name-player} on ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] journey.${prompt}
  7491: I know! How about I go to Windurst with ${name-player}?${prompt}
  7492: Hey, how about I go to Windurst, too? I'm sure ${name-player} won't mind.${prompt}
  7493: If ${name-player} doesn't mind, do you think I could come along, too?${prompt}
  7494: If ${name-player} doesn't mind, I'd like to come along, too!${prompt}
  7495: If ${name-player} doesn't mind, I suppose I should join ${choice-player-gender}[him/her].${prompt}
  7496: Think I could come along too, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  7497: I suppose I should accompany ${name-player} on ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] journey.${prompt}
  7498: I can accompany ${name-player} on ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] journey. ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] won't mind.${prompt}
  7499: Wait a minute. Since there are two of you now, I've got one more thing I wonder if you could do for me.${prompt}
  7500: I want one of you to earn me time while Angelica is redoing the painting.${prompt}
  7501: What do you mean by that?${prompt}
  7502: What's that supposed to mean?${prompt}
  7503: Meaning?${prompt}
  7504: Earning time, sir?${prompt}
  7505: What do you mean?${prompt}
  7506: How do we do that?${prompt}
  7507: Hm? What do you mean?${prompt}
  7508: Earning time, eh? What do you mean?${prompt}
  7509: Meaning what, exactly?${prompt}
  7510: Huh? Earning time?${prompt}
  7511: Earning time, sir?${prompt}
  7512: Earn you time? Care to elaborate?${prompt}
  7513: I want you to bring that old crank an empty box...${prompt}
  7514: And I want you to tell him that it holds the painting, but that he can't open it until you say he can, because the painting is so delicate, you see?${prompt}
  7515: That scrooge'll believe that the painting is in the box, and we'll have earned enough time to get the real thing!${prompt}
  7516: When Angelica finishes the painting, we can just exchange it for the empty box, and the old man will be none the wiser!${prompt}
  7517: That way, I won't have to tell him I lost the painting...${prompt}
  7518: '...and I can avoid punishment...${prompt}'
  7519: However, I can't do it alone! That's right! I need your help, brave adventurers!${prompt}
  7520: So you're asking us to deceive a poor old man?${prompt}
  7521: You've got a lot of nerve, asking us to deceive a poor old man!${prompt}
  7522: You want us to deceive a fragile old man, eh?${prompt}
  7523: So you want us to deceive an elderly man.${prompt}
  7524: You want us to lie to the old man?${prompt}
  7525: Deceiving a poor old man just isn't my style...${prompt}
  7526: So you want us to trick a poor old man?${prompt}
  7527: You mean you want us to trick a poor old man!?${prompt}
  7528: Hmph. Deceiving a poor old man...${prompt}
  7529: Eh～? You want us to trick a poor old man!${prompt}
  7530: So you want us to deceive an elderly man.${prompt}
  7531: Deception goes against my principles...${prompt}
  7532: You do look like you need help. Okay, we'll do it!${prompt}
  7533: You're my kind of guy! Let's do it!${prompt}
  7534: Fine, whatever. We will help.${prompt}
  7535: It appears to be a necessary sacrifice, though. We will help.${prompt}
  7536: But, I suppose it can't be helped. We'll do it!${prompt}
  7537: But, you're trying to do a good thing. So we'll help you.${prompt}
  7538: Well, you are in a desperate situation. Okay, we'll do it!${prompt}
  7539: Guess that's just the way it is! We'll help!${prompt}
  7540: You do need our help, though. Count me in.${prompt}
  7541: But it looks like there's no way around it... Okay, we'll do it!${prompt}
  7542: It appears to be a necessary sacrifice, though. We will help.${prompt}
  7543: But, your circumstance cannot be ignored. We will help you.${prompt}
  7544: Really? Oh, thank you!${prompt}
  7545: So, ${name-player}, which will it be?${prompt}
  7546: Would you rather go to Angelica to reorder the painting, or would you rather come with me to the old man's place to earn time?${prompt}
  7547: |-
    What will you do?
    ${selection-lines}
    Go to Angelica.
    Go to the old man with Diederik.${prompt}
  7548: Well, I guess I'd better go earn you time, then. Good luck, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7549: Time to go earn some time! Later, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7550: I suppose I should go earn time. Later, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7551: I will earn time, then. May luck be with you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7552: I'll go and buy us some time. Good luck, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7553: Leave the time-earning to me, ${name-player}. Let's do this!${prompt}
  7554: I'll go earn you time, then. Good luck, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7555: I'll earn you time! Go get 'em, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7556: I suppose I shall go earn you time, then. Later, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7557: Okay, I'll earn time for you! Bye-bye, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7558: I will earn time, then. May luck be with you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7559: I will see to the old man. Head to Windurst and do what you can, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7560: Well, I guess I'd better be off to see Angelica, then! Good luck, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7561: I'm off to catch Angelica, then! Later, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7562: I suppose I should go see Angelica, then. Later, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7563: I will go to Angelica, then. May luck be with you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7564: Okay, guess I'll go see Angelica. Good luck, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7565: It's off to Windurst for me, then. Go earn us some time, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7566: I'll go meet Angelica, then. Good luck, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7567: I'll go talk to Angelica! Go get 'em, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7568: I suppose I shall go speak with Angelica, then. Later, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7569: Okay, I'll go talk to Angelica! Bye-bye, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7570: I will go to Angelica, then. May luck be with you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7571: I will see to the painter. Head to Bastok and do what you can, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7572: Well then, it's decided. Thanks--this is a big load off my back. Things are starting to look up for me!${prompt}
  7573: We should be fine, with all three of us working together!${prompt}
  7574: I'll go get ready now.${prompt}
  7575: Oh, it's you again. Angelica should be at the hostelry in Windurst.${prompt}
  7576: Please get her to redo the painting for me!${prompt}
  7577: Oh, it's you again. The old man's name is Umberto, and you should be able to find him in Bastok.${prompt}
  7578: If you don't hurry, the delivery date is going to come and go! Now get out there, already!${prompt}
  7579: 'Sorry, but you''re the only one I can count on. Please find the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for me.${prompt}'
  7580: Back when I used to stock them, my supplier said he got them from the Korroloka Tunnel.${prompt}
  7581: I've been waiting for you! I've got big news!${prompt}
  7582: I found the painting that I thought I lost to the pirates!${prompt}
  7583: I'm so relieved. Now I can just put it in that old man's box and be done with it all.${prompt}
  7584: Eh? What'd you mean, asking me what I'm going to do with the redone painting? We've found the original, so we don't need it!${prompt}
  7585: Think you could just hop over to Windurst for me real quick and let Angelica know she doesn't have to redo it?${prompt}
  7586: I mean, I won't force you or anything...${prompt}
  7587: But I've got to go pick up that original painting, you know, so it would be really nice of you if you could help me out.${prompt}
  7588: It's not like I don't want to meet her or anything! Of course not.${prompt}
  7589: I would be so grateful if you went and told Angelica for me.${prompt}
  7590: What's wrong? You don't look so good. Run into trouble somewhere?${prompt}
  7591: What!? Your friend is in trouble?${prompt}
  7592: So what are you doing standing around here for?${prompt}
  7593: Go and save your friend!${prompt}
  7594: Don't you care what happens to your friend? Get out there and be brave!${prompt}
  7595: Your friend is okay? What a relief!${prompt}
  7596: Could you hop over to see Angelica and tell her that we don't need her to redo the painting after all?${prompt}
  7597: She redid the painting already!? Why would she do that?${prompt}
  7598: Anyway, I guess I'd better go slip the original painting in the box before the old man notices...${prompt}
  7599: Thanks for all your help.${prompt}
  7600: I'm sure your good deeds will come back to you someday. I won't forget this!${prompt}
  7601: So what's your friend up to now?${prompt}

  7666: Fish Ranking is a contest held periodically by the Fishermen's Guild. Participants compete based on a set of defined rules regarding the size and weight of a certain big fish.${prompt}
  7667: To participate, you must acquire the fish we specified for the contest and bring it here. We won't look over your shoulder to see if you're catching your fish or buying them. That's your personal decision.${prompt}
  7668: You can only have one fish entered for Fish Ranking at once. You can choose to overwrite your current entry with a new catch, but you won't be able to re-register your previous submission.${prompt}
  7669: We will announce the results after the submission period ends. The top ten entries will receive a modest award and prize money, as well as a new title.${prompt}
  7670: Fish are judged based on a set of predetermined rules.${prompt}
  7671: The rules are simple. All fish are inscribed with their size (Im) and weight (Pz). The contest may be judged based on either number, or even both values added together.${prompt}
  7672: Depending on the rules, the person who caught the fish with the lowest or the greatest value wins!${prompt}
  7673: Value is determined by the calculation of “points” and evaluated based on the contest rules. For example, when the rules designate the “smallest fish,” the person with the fewest points will win.${prompt}
  7674: During the submission period, I will inform everyone what criterion we are judging by, so just ask if you're curious!${prompt}
  7675: 'If you would like to submit an entry, please ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the fish specified for the contest to me, and I will give it a rough inspection.${prompt}'
  7676: |-
    The fish will be registered if I deem it is suitable for the contest.
    You may only have one fish registered at a time. Registering a second specimen will remove your previous submission from the entry database.${prompt}
  7677: After you pay the registration fee, I will return your fish to you. All that's left afterwards is to wait for the results.${prompt}
  7678: To ensure a fair contest, we will label your fish before returning it.${prompt}
  7679: This will not affect the fish other than disqualifying it from reentry in Fish Ranking. You can still cook the fish, sell it at auction, or use it for quests.${prompt}
  7680: After the submission period ends, the results will be announced. To view the ranking board, just speak to me.${prompt}
  7681: Anybody may view the ranking board. You'll especially want to check if you or a friend participated in the last contest. Perhaps one of you will be listed on the board, too!${prompt}
  7682: The top ten contestants will receive a modest award consisting of prize money from the Fishermen's Guild and a new title.${prompt}
  7683: 'In addition, participants in the top twenty will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} as a souvenir.${prompt}'
