    You're no different from those fools who suspect me! G-g-get out of my sight!${prompt}

    Yes, yes, trust is good for the soul.
    Now, if you'll allow me, hee hee hee...${prompt}
  7135: The deed is done. The rest is up to you to wield it as you have thus far.${prompt}
  7136: An invisible, mystical energy resides within your weapon. I would explain the n-n-nature of this energy in more detail, but I fear it is beyond the comprehension of a layperson.${prompt}
  7137: Wh-what? You doubt my kn-kn-knowledge on the subject!?${prompt}
  7138: Hmph. I won't deny that research is still ongoing. I do know, however, that those who venture deeper within the Nyzul Isle develop g-g-greater affinity with these artifacts.${prompt}
  7139: 'So indeed, if you''ve already come to be in p-p-possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you can expect stupendous results.${prompt}'
  7140: Note, though, that I have merely awakened your weapon from its long s-s-slumber. You must, through usage, accumulate said energy to the point of saturation.${prompt}
  7141: With that accomplished, a m-m-most extraordinary evolution will take place.${prompt}
  7142: When that happens, bring the weapon to me. I promise it'll be a profitable v-v-venture for you...and yours truly, too. Ahee hee hee...${prompt}

    Goodness g-g-gracious me!
    The energy within is threatening to b-b-burst forth! It won't be long now, hee hee hee...${prompt}

  7165: Hi. I'm Aldo, head of Tenshodo. We deal in things you can't buy anywhere else. Take your time and have a look around.${prompt}
  7166: So you're the new diplomatic attaché. What, you've got a secret message from the archduke? Well, let me see it.${prompt}
  7167: I see. Thanks for getting this to me. It says I'm supposed to tell you about magicite.${prompt}
  7168: Magicite is found deep inside Castle Oztroja, Davoi, and Beadeaux. But those places are thick with beastmen, and those beastmen are quite cunning.${prompt}
  7169: You'll need this to get inside Beadeaux.${prompt}
  7170: Aldo...${prompt}
  7171: What is it, Verena? Can't you see I have a guest?${prompt}
  7172: I know. That's what it's about.${prompt}
  7173: I heard that the archduke has made a statement...${prompt}
  7174: He's ordered all beastmen out of Jeuno. He must not think it's safe to have them around anymore.${prompt}
  7175: What? I think those creeps in the palace are a lot worse than any beastmen we have here!${prompt}
  7176: It's like they're wearing masks...you can't tell what they're thinking. And their eyes are like cold stones. You're not gonna follow that order, are you?${prompt}
  7177: Well, I know how you feel, but with beastmen on the rampage out there, you can't blame people for feeling jittery about the ones in here.${prompt}
  7178: You've heard about all that, haven't you?${prompt}
  7179: Yeah, I've heard. But the beastmen in town haven't ever hurt anybody!${prompt}
  7180: I know that, Verena... But I don't think the average Jeunoan would agree.${prompt}
  7181: No...${prompt}
  7182: Maybe it's the wise thing to do. You know, taking action before things get out of hand.${prompt}
  7183: Well, I'll see if I can think up a better alternative. Don't worry. I'd be the last guy to chase them out of town.${prompt}
  7184: Okay. You promised, remember!${prompt}
  7185: Verena...${prompt}
  7186: Fickie!${prompt}
  7187: 'Oh!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  7188: Fickie... Are you all right?${prompt}
  7189: That's a weird thing to ask. I'm always all right. How about you? You look pale!${prompt}
  7190: Oh, um... No. No, I'm fine.${prompt}
  7191: Oh, all right. Well, let's get going!${prompt}
  7192: Um, okay.${prompt}
  7193: Magicite is found deep inside Castle Oztroja, Davoi, and Beadeaux. Those places are thick with murderous beastmen, and their traps are cunning.${prompt}
  7194: There's not a rumor that doesn't find its way to Jeuno. I bet you can find what you need from other adventurers. May your strength never falter!${prompt}
  7195: What? You say the beastmen might be plotting something else? Yeah, it wouldn't be like them to just give up.${prompt}
  7196: I don't want anything to do with beastmen anymore. I bet the old Goblin Muckvix knows more, but you'd have to ask him yourself.${prompt}
  7197: Verena's really worried about Fickblix. Better not mention beastmen around her.${prompt}
  7198: I wonder who's worse, us or them? Fickie's never done anything bad at all.${prompt}
  7199: Just 'cause they're not human doesn't mean we should hate them. Even a kid like Fickie gets treated like dirt.${prompt}
  7200: I don't know what's right or wrong anymore. I can't help anybody. I'm sorry.${prompt}
  7201: What? Fickie's seeds started to grow? Hey, what's that gotta do with me, huh?${prompt}
  7202: '''Course I don''t like war. But that ain''t the same thing.${prompt}'
  7203: Hey, I'm a beastie. I ain't tellin' you zilch if it'd hurt my peoples.${prompt}
  7204: So, Fickblix's seeds started to sprout...${prompt}
  7205: Aldo, I...${prompt}
  7206: Verena, I heard your flowers started to sprout. I bet all you kids gave it lots of water. That kind of seed doesn't take root that easily.${prompt}
  7207: Maybe everything you and Fickblix acomplished really did mean something.${prompt}
  7208: Recently I... I haven't been watering it. I thought of nothing but myself. I'm so sorry, Fickie.${prompt}
  7209: Yeah, maybe it's not a question of what's right and what's wrong.${prompt}
  7210: Nothing would be better than averting another conflict... For us, and for them.${prompt}
  7211: All right! I don't know what we can do, but I'll help. Fickie would never forgive us if we just stood silent.${prompt}
  7212: That's right! The least we can do is try.${prompt}
  7213: But I don't know if we can find out what their little group is up to.${prompt}
  7214: I guess we could ask Muckvix.${prompt}
  7215: But would he help? He always tries to stay out of these racial matters.${prompt}
  7216: And if he told us anything, he'd be betraying his own kind.${prompt}
  7217: Yeah, I know. But there's nothing else we can do. ${name-player}, would you mind asking Muckvix? We'll head there later.${prompt}
  7218: Hey, I ain't got nuttin' to say to ya. Scram.${prompt}
  7219: We need your help, too, Muckvix.${prompt}
  7220: Oh, so you're in this too, huh? Whaddaya tryin' to pull here?${prompt}
  7221: Please, Muck. You're our only hope. Jeuno--no, the entire world is in danger unless you tell us.${prompt}
  7222: Hey, I've been livin' here for ages, but when it comes down to it, I'm just a beastie, ain't I?${prompt}
  7223: You ain't gonna get nuttin' outta me. See, we beasties are all brudders.${prompt}
  7224: Muck, you don't think of us as your own, but those kids and I helped Fickie's seeds grow... To us, people and beastmen are the same. We're all one and the same!${prompt}
  7225: And now, the chance for peace is in danger. Please, Muck, tell us!${prompt}
  7226: Chance for peace, huh? Aw, that Fickie... What would he do if he was here?${prompt}
  7227: Aw, what the hell. But just this once! And only 'cause I owe your father. May my peoples forgive me...${prompt}
  7228: Okay, so the crew you're lookin' for's always been kinda cold to us.${prompt}
  7229: They're just a bunch of tough guys, but sometimes they go buck wild. I heard they're growin' into a big mob, so they must be up to somethin'!${prompt}
  7230: Try lookin' around the Eldieme Necropolis. I heard the bums who left Davoi are layin' low there. And I ain't gonna say nuttin' more!${prompt}
  7231: Thanks, Muck!${prompt}
  7232: Muckvix, thanks a million.${prompt}
  7233: I am Zauko. I patrol Lower Jeuno.${prompt}

  7253: Light the twelve lamps facing the ocean. I know you've done it before, but try to finish by one in the morning.${prompt}
  7254: Oh? It's not hard. Come back if you change your mind.${prompt}
  7255: Sorry. I already have a helper tonight. Maybe tomorrow.${prompt}

  7260: Next time you come to Jeuno, think of the special evening when you gave light to its streets.${prompt}

  7425: He's at his own crossroads. He has to figure it out for himself.${prompt}

  7434: No matter how much the worrrld changes, people are still the same. Oh, how I long to be loved like that...${prompt}
  7435: Well, anyway... I bet those bitter lyrics would rrreally cheer up the broken-hearted.${prompt}
  7436: Oh, you've been to Buburimu? They say couples descend on the place at nightfall. How do they dodge the monsterrrs?${prompt}

  7439: Oh, you're a barrrd too? Then stop by more often!${prompt}

  7447: No it ain't! Nobody cares about such an oldie.${prompt}
  7448: Well, my apologies, but have you ever even tried it? Just because it's old doesn't mean it's not good, you know.${prompt}
  7449: Hmm...${prompt}
  7450: Just give it a try. What have you got to lose?${prompt}
  7451: Good to see you again.${prompt}
  7452: I have a feeling we'll meet again. I hope by then you'll have learned to appreciate this song.${prompt}
  7453: I've seen him before, somewhere...${prompt}
  7454: Who does he think he is? He doesn't know a thing about all the pain I've gone through!${prompt}
  7455: Wait, could he be...? Naw, he couldn't be.${prompt}

  7470: I was just playing with Verena, but she's feeling down. And I know why.${prompt}
  7471: The beasties outside town are getting restless. That makes Verena worried. So I'm going to Oztroja and ask them to settle down.${prompt}
  7472: I think the beasties outside can get along with people, like I could with Verena. I really believe so.${prompt}
  7473: Yeah, maybe you got a point there.${prompt}
  7474: Well, I'm off.${prompt}

  7477: You be careful out there.${prompt}
  7478: I'll be okay. They'll listen to me.${prompt}
  7479: Yeah, my generation can't forget the war, so it's real hard to relate.${prompt}

  7481: Fickie? Is Fickie here?${prompt}
  7482: Hey, you just missed him. Said somethin' about goin' to Castle Oztroja. You didn't see him on your way in here?${prompt}
  7483: No, it's just... Some adventurers said they were going out to hunt beastmen, so I got so worried...${prompt}
  7484: I always told him to stay here in town. I told him if people found him in a dungeon somewhere, they might mistake him for a bad beastman, and then they'd...${prompt}
  7485: Ain't nothin' you can do. That kid's a beastie, and even the people in this town give us the cold shoulder.${prompt}
  7486: Well, he don't belong out there none neither... But I still think he's safer out there than in here.${prompt}
  7487: I'm so worried about him.${prompt}
  7488: That girl understands things that only us beasties do. Maybe Fickie and her can break down the walls that keep us apart.${prompt}

  7790: Of course, sometimes we fail to understand how different we all are. That's just the kind of thing we need to avoid.${prompt}
  7791: I like to stand here and watch you people rrrun back and forth all day. I wonder what the hurry is...${prompt}
  7792: Sometimes you should slow down and walk for a change. You know, stop and smell the rrroses!${prompt}
  7793: Good day, and welcome to Lower Jeuno. Our neighborhood is the city's premier retail destination, handling a broad range of merchandise.${prompt}
  7794: We hope you enjoy the unique shopping experience of Lower Jeuno. What, you were expecting someone younger? Away with you!${prompt}
  7795: To me, the auction's like a game of wits between me and the other bidders.${prompt}
  7796: You always have to keep tabs on what you really want, and how much you want to pay for it. It's so easy to get carried away!${prompt}
  7797: When I was but a lass, I oft would follow my lover to this fountain. He would speak barely a word, so shy was he!${prompt}
  7798: To love someone is a wonderful thing. Only now, at my age, does that seem so clear.${prompt}
  7799: Oh, my husband? Yes, he's quite well. He's so full of life, I know not what to do!${prompt}
  7800: You must examine all the advertisements to find the very best deals!${prompt}
  7801: Little may be the difference between these shops, but ever am I thrilled to save some gil. Oh, such a miser am I!${prompt}

  7807: 'Well, well... I see you have attained your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. But you still need more training, child. You must seek the rank of ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'

  7811: 'Slay a nue for its ${item-singular: 2[2]}, a morbolger for its ${item-singular: 3[2]}, and a deadly dodo for its ${item-singular: 4[2]}. Gather these and bring them to me.${prompt}'
  7812: Only then will you be worthy of promotion. Now, go!${prompt}
  7813: What are you afraid of? The true martial artist does not fear.${prompt}
  7814: 'Oh... The circle is now complete. Wear this ${item-singular: 1[2]} with pride and honor. Always remember the trials you faced to claim it.${prompt}'
  7815: Perhaps one day we can face each other in open-hand combat. A glorious fight that would be, don't you think?${prompt}
  7816: You call yourself ${name-player}? Well, I've never heard of you. You may be somebody in your little hometown, but things are different here.${prompt}
  7817: All roads lead to Jeuno. It's not easy to make a name for yourself with all these people here.${prompt}
  7818: If you're really so famous back home, then word should reach here eventually. For now, just finish what you've started. Fame and fortune should follow.${prompt}
  7819: ${name-player}, eh? Hmm... That name is vaguely familiar...${prompt}
  7820: But I'm afraid few in this town have heard of you. Just keep working at it. You'll make a name for yourself eventually.${prompt}
  7821: Oh, so you're ${name-player}... Yes, I heard some travelers in a tavern talk about you. It seems you've a fair reputation.${prompt}
  7822: If you keep doing whatever you're doing, I'm sure more Jeunoans will come seeking your help. Good luck.${prompt}
  7823: Hello, ${name-player}! I hear your name mentioned quite often these days. You've done well, my friend. Keep at it.${prompt}

    Welcome to the auction house.
    Do you have any questions about our establishment?${prompt}
  7833: |-
    What do you want to know?
    ${selection-lines}
    What is the auction house?
    How are auctions run?
    Are there any fees?
    Are there any limits?
    How do you check up on merchandise?
    How do you remove an item?
    My “Sales Status” list is full!
    Nothing right now.${prompt}
  7834: Auction houses can be found in all of Vana'diel's major cities. Here adventurers gather to bid on battle spoils, unwanted items, old armor...almost anything.${prompt}
  7835: Currently, the auction houses in Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno all work independently. Therefore, prices differ from city to city.${prompt}
  7836: Adventurers may use any auction house regardless of nationality.${prompt}
  7837: The first adventurer to bid at or above the asking price will automatically purchase the product.${prompt}
  7838: Once put up for auction, merchandise will remain there for a maximum of thirty weeks Vana'diel time (nine-and-a-half days Earth time).${prompt}
  7839: If merchandise does not sell within this time limit, it will be returned to the seller's current residence.${prompt}
  7840: Transaction fees are proportional to the amount for which an item is put up on auction. The method of calculating this fee is different for single items and stackable items.${prompt}
  7841: A transaction fee is collected when any merchandise is put up for auction. This fee is nonrefundable.${prompt}
  7842: The International Auction House Committee, or IAHC, has declared that a maximum of seven items may be put up for auction at one time.${prompt}
  7843: However, the IAHC has recently removed the limit to how many items one may purchase.${prompt}
  7844: A small amount of time is required before new merchandise appears on our bid list.${prompt}
  7845: Once an item appears on your “Sales Status” list, it may not immediately appear on the bid list. If you do not see your item on the bid list, try looking again at a later time.${prompt}
  7846: If you would like to withdraw an item from an auction, you must travel to the auction house, and select “Stop Sale” from the “Sales Status” menu.${prompt}
  7847: To remove an item from your “Sales Status” list, you must visit an auction counter to acknowledge the sale or return of your merchandise.${prompt}
  7848: Otherwise, previously sold or returned items will fill up your list and prevent you from selling any more merchandise.${prompt}
  7849: At any auction counter, open the “Sales Status” menu and acknowledge the transaction to clear it from the list.${prompt}
  7850: Press the confirm button to remove any transaction colored yellow (sold) or red (returned).${prompt}
  7851: Is there anything else you would like to know?${prompt}
  7852: In the past, many have amassed great wealth through the auction house. I hope you find fortune, too!${prompt}

    Well, ladies and gentlemen, are we all here?
    Allow me to introduce myself. I am Vauderame.${prompt}
  7932: I don't possess a talent for witty repartee as do most of my fellow Elvaan, so I will get straight to the point.${prompt}
  7933: Firstly, I wonder if you have heard of the group known as Atarefaunet's band?${prompt}
  7934: Also known as the Scarlet Thunder of La Theine, rrright?${prompt}
  7935: The Scarlet what?${prompt}
  7936: A bit before your time, young one? You need to study more.${prompt}
  7937: It was a group of thieves that once terrorized merchants on the roads between San d'Oria, Bastok, and Jeuno, stealing damn huge amounts of money and goods.${prompt}
  7938: '...Traveling merchants would quake in fear at the mere mention of that damn name...${prompt}'
  7939: It would seem the veterans among you are well-versed in thieving history.${prompt}
  7940: During the Great War, the leader of the band, Atarefaunet, was killed by a traitor and the rest of the members scattered to the winds.${prompt}
  7941: However, the Tenshodo has managed to divine the current whereabouts of the remaining members.${prompt}
  7942: 'The task I have called you here for today is to deliver a ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} to each of the thieves of Atarefaunet''s band.${prompt}'
  7943: |-
    Why would you want us to do that? Do you mean to bring them together to form a new thieving group?
    ...Damn!${prompt}
  7944: |-
    No, of course not.
    What could thieves of twenty years ago accomplish now?${prompt}
  7945: Nevertheless, it would not be wise to leave them to their own devices. It's possible that some amongst them might seek to regain the glory of the past.${prompt}
  7946: The Tenshodo simply wishes to measure their intentions. If those members plan on beginning any activities, we ask that they inform us about it.${prompt}
  7947: '...That is the main point of the message in the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  7948: However, it is not certain that they will just meekly sign the papers. My job is to make certain these brigands follow the will of the Tenshodo.${prompt}
  7949: And that is where you come in. Use your knowledge and talents to get those signatures and bring them back here to me.${prompt}
  7950: I will now hand each of you a sealed envelope. Seek out the member whose name is revealed therein.${prompt}
  7951: Lastly, it is against thieving etiquette to sneak a look at the members assigned to people other than yourself. As I'm sure you are aware, too much knowledge is a dangerous thing in this business...${prompt}
  7952: Now, please come to me one at a time to receive your envelope.${prompt}
  7953: You are the adventurer thief ${name-player}?${prompt}

  8016: Hey, what are you tryin' to pull? Get lost!${prompt}
  8017: Sorry, I'm busy. Something awful has happened, and it'll take one helluva beastmaster to sort it out.${prompt}
  8018: Perfect timing! We were hoping to find a renowned beastmaster like you to take care of a little problem.${prompt}
  8019: You see, the beasts who inhabit Eldieme are acting strange lately. It's like they're under someone's control. They've attacked adventurers, and recently killed one!${prompt}
  8020: People suspect we beastmasters have something to do with it. You should know we'd never do anything like that. Won't you look into this for us?${prompt}

  8022: |-
    Will you help us?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course I will.

  8031: |-
    Ahhhhhh-choo!
    Excuse me. I think I caught myself a cold riding that old girl all night. My son's been taking care of me since morning.${prompt}

    Could you throw it away for me?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oh, I suppose.
    No, do it yourself.${prompt}
  8038: Thank you! But this gift is too precious to toss into the garbage... I know! Could you cast it into the Waters of Oblivion at Ranguemont Pass?${prompt}
  8039: Good luck, and don't just dump it at some auction house, all right?${prompt}
  8040: Hmm... Maybe you're right. But I don't think I can bring myself to do it!${prompt}
  8041: It's too precious to throw into the garbage. No, it needs a more peaceful resting place, like the Water of Oblivion in Ranguemont Pass.${prompt}
  8042: You threw it in? Thank you! My heart feels at peace, knowing that my ordeal is behind me. Please, take this in thanks.${prompt}
  8043: Perhaps everything is as full of memories as that bracelet... Should someone find it a hundred years hence, what shall they feel?${prompt}
  8044: Yes, maybe such feelings do not diminish with the flow of time. Oh, what a moving thought!${prompt}
  8045: Perhaps my heartfelt pain will live on in my song. Such is the life of a bard!${prompt}
  8046: Say, I see you're quite a bard now. I'm looking for a bard, you see...${prompt}

  8051: Oh, you're busy, huh? Well, who am I supposed to ask now? Bards like you don't exactly grow on trees, you know!${prompt}
  8052: Say, how about that task I told you about?${prompt}
  8053: Good, this will do nicely. Now for the task! I want you to visit the grave of a great bard of yesteryear and pray for him.${prompt}
  8054: Why, you ask? I don't know; it's just something we always do. They say he met a tragic end. Go ask other bards if you want to learn about him.${prompt}
  8055: His stone sarcophagus is deep inside the Eldieme Necropolis. It's one of several, and I can't remember which. Well, you'll find it.${prompt}
  8056: 'A little investigation will reveal which one is his. Purify it with that ${item-singular: 0[2]} and play the requiem. You don''t know the tune? It''s okay, just go!${prompt}'
  8057: Huh? The bard interred inside Eldieme? Yeah, he was executed in San d'Oria for committing a serious crime!${prompt}
  8058: So you're off to pray at his grave, huh? Be careful! You never know what evil lurks in those halls!${prompt}
  8059: 'Oh, did you take the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and play the requiem? The task isn''t complete until you''ve done both!${prompt}'
  8060: Good work, ${name-player}! Yeah, sorry I didn't tell you about the monsters. Otherwise nobody would go! Understand?${prompt}
  8061: Huh? After that a man came and gave you a ring? I hope he wasn't a grave robber!${prompt}
  8062: But don't give that ring to me; I hate antiques. Anyway, here's your reward. Thanks again!${prompt}
  8063: Well, that's out of the way. Now who should I ask for the next task? Bards can be so selfish sometimes!${prompt}
  8064: So, what did you do with that ring? Maybe it's valuable. I'd ask a collector if I were you. Of course, he might just say it's worthless...${prompt}
  8065: You have emerged as a hero to the people of Jeuno. Just the sound of your name strikes courage into their hearts.${prompt}
  8066: As a representative of its citizens, I humbly ask you to continue your efforts for the good of the Duchy.${prompt}
  8067: 'Good luck, ${choice: 0}[citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation''s Signet.${wait-animation: 0}${prompt}'

    Conquests.
    Conquest results.
    Donating crystals.
    Conquest points.
    The effects of controlling regions.
    Regions controlled by other nations.
    Regions under beastman control.${prompt}
  8083: All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt}
  8084: Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt}
  8085: Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt}
  8086: So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt}
  8087: |-
    Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.
    They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt}
  8088: Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt}
  8089: Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt}
  8090: |-
    So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.
    We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt}
  8091: |-
    You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.
    Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt}
  8092: |-
    Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.
    The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt}
  8093: |-
    You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  8094: |-
    We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  8095: |-
    You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.
    Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt}
  8096: Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt}
  8097: |-
    You also receive rank points for completing missions.
    Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt}
  8098: |-
    You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.
    Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}
  8099: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt}
  8100: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt}
  8101: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt}
  8102: Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt}
  8103: Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt}
  8104: Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt}
  8105: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt}
  8106: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt}
  8107: |-
    Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.
    If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt}
  8108: If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt}
  8109: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt}
  8110: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt}
  8111: There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt}
  8112: |-
    Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.
    Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.${prompt}

  8465: You just wait, Eald'narche! I'm not going to let you stand in our way!${prompt}
  8466: Hold up there, ${name-player}. Where's Aldo? You didn't just leave him on that cursed island to die, did you?${prompt}
  8467: If anything has happened to our boss, don't even think you'll be leaving here alive!${prompt}
  8468: What's with the long faces? You guys look like you just got back from a funeral!${prompt}
  8469: Boss!${prompt}
  8470: You're...still alive!${prompt}
  8471: Did you really think that I, the great Aldo, would flop at the hands of a couple worms like those Zilart?${prompt}

  8495: You may be right, Verena. And if there's any shred of hope, the least we can do is continue to believe.${prompt}
  8496: So, ${name-player}.${prompt}

    Well, I think it's time I took that vacation I've been promising myself. You should go someplace quiet and get some rest as well.

  8539: Hold on, m-mister! Who do you think you are, getting all chummy-wummy with my Chululu!?${prompt}
  8540: Would you control yourself, Kurou! This is my hair stylist, Runga-Kopunga. He's been telling me these past few days that I should get my hair done.${prompt}
  8541: I've been trying my best to convince her to let me work my mastery, but she just keeps dissy-dissing me. I envy that buddy-buddy of hers...${prompt}
  8542: Her buddy-buddy?${prompt}
  8543: Yeah. When they were still little kiddos, somebody told her that he liked her hairstyle--and she hasn't changed it since. I just want to talk to that square and ask him if he could convince Chululu here to let me work my magic on her.${prompt}

  8552: Well, we know it wasn't you! And why should I tell you, anyway?${prompt}

    Hmmm...
    So, do you think she understood how I feel?${prompt}

    Terrible, huh?

  8559: Now, don'taru you go telling Chululu I said that!${prompt}
  8560: |-

  8665: |-
    No way!
    ${name-player}! If you're a real ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman], you'll march your butt up to the Grand Duke Palace and face your crimes!${prompt}
  8666: |-
    Tough on everyone but yourself, I see...
    Very well. It will take some time to prepare the ship. I will send a messenger when everything is ready. Until then, why don't you take a look around the city?${prompt}
  8667: Got it. Thanks, Aldo.${prompt}
  8668: Alright! Now it's time to have some fun!${prompt}
  8669: See ya, ${name-player}! Maybe we can get together again sometime...if you're still alive!${prompt}

  8671: It looks like you should probably turn yourself in, ${name-player}. This may be the only chance to try and prove your innocence.${prompt}
  8672: ${name-player}, you weren't thinking of running now, were you? If you know what's good for you, you'll head on up to the Grand Duke Palace and face your crimes.${prompt}
  8673: Ah, ${name-player}. Just the ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] I wanted to see.${prompt}
  8674: A young lady claiming to be Prishe's acquaintance is here...${prompt}
  8675: ${name-player}! It is so nice to see you again. Have you not seen Prishe about?${prompt}
  8676: Hm? You are searching for her as well?${prompt}
  8677: |-
    I see...
    You wish to know more of the magicite gem that a peddler from Tavnazia sold to Bastok over thirty years ago...${prompt}
  8678: I do recall hearing stories of the “Star of Tavnazia”; unfortunately, I never actually set my eyes upon it. I do not know what it is, or if the magicite was a piece of it.${prompt}
  8679: |-
    Magicite...
    The Star of Tavnazia...${prompt}
  8680: |-
    ?
    Sir Aldo? You would not happen to know anything of the gem, would you?${prompt}
  8681: I've heard stories of a mysterious gem kept in the Tavnazian Cathedral. If that relic is also magicite, I wonder in what way it's connected with the other magicite found around Vana'diel...${prompt}
  8682: Deep within the Orc, Quadav, and Yagudo strongholds, there are doors that the beastmen guard with their lives. Beyond those doors lie giant crystals emitting a strange, eerie light.${prompt}
  8683: If the beastmen were drawn to these crystals and chose those areas to build their towns, then the magicite in the Northlands is more than likely... Hmmm...${prompt}
  8684: Perhaps someone in Tavnazia knows something. However, we cannot leave without Prishe. Oh, where could she have wandered off to?${prompt}
  8685: |-
    Leader!
    That girl! She's been taken to Doctor Monberaux's!${prompt}
  8686: |-
    What!?
    What happened!?${prompt}
  8687: It seems that she was attacked while visiting the Temple of the Goddess!${prompt}
  8688: Attacked!?${prompt}
  8689: Prishe!
  8690: |-
    They say some Elvaan girl was attacked while in the Temple of the Goddess--right in front of the statue of Altana!
    What is this city coming to!?${prompt}
  8691: |-
    Huh? You think it was a Tenshodo member that did the dirty deed!?
    ${name-player}, you'd better watch your tongue unless you want to see it on a plate!${prompt}
  8692: That blue-haired girl was taken to Monberaux's after the attack. I'm pretty sure she'll be all right, though. Doctor M. is the best medic in town.${prompt}
  8693: You don't need to worry, ${name-player}. Our city's fine doctor is taking care of Prishe as we speak.${prompt}
  8694: And as for the fiends that would do something like this, I guarantee you my men and women will find them.${prompt}
  8695: If you're looking for Prishe, she and that rich boy Tenzen have already set sail for the Tavnazian Archipelago. You're following them, right?${prompt}
  8696: Sir, the airships are ready for departure.${prompt}
  8697: I will be traveling on a separate vessel. If “he” appears before I arrive, prevent him from escaping, but do not attack.${prompt}
  8698: Yes, sir!${prompt}
  8699: It is all working as planned. Now, I will finally retrieve what is mine.${prompt}
  8700: |-
    Hey there, pal.
    I just met the weirdest Elvaan kid.${prompt}
  8701: She didn't have a single gil on her, but she spent hours in the gem store mooning over the same piece of jewelry.${prompt}
  8702: Eventually, the beauties working behind the counter got tired of her antics and threw her out.${prompt}
  8703: I'd been watching the whole thing and had the rotten luck of meeting the girl's eyes when she left the store.${prompt}
  8704: She's been dogging me ever since.${prompt}
  8705: I don't know if it was female intuition or what, but somehow she figured out I have a thing for the three ladies in the gem store.${prompt}
  8706: |-
    ...
    So, which one's my favorite out of the three?${prompt}
  8707: At first I thought the classical beauty on the left was my type.${prompt}
  8708: But then I got to thinking older women are the way to go, like the lady on the right.${prompt}
  8709: |-
    And then, not long ago, the pure and innocent type in the middle actually said hello to me.
    Now I'm captivated by her charms.${prompt}
  8710: To be perfectly honest with you, any of those three ladies could make me a happy man.${prompt}
  8711: My plan is to confess my feelings to the one who likes me the most--the one least likely to turn me down.${prompt}
  8712: |-
    When I explained all this to the Elvaan girl, she almost split her sides in laughter.
    The little brat!${prompt}
  8713: 'She told me that if I talked to each of the ladies in turn while holding ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, I would know which of them had feelings for me.${prompt}'
  8714: 'But I''ve never even heard of ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, let alone seen one.${prompt}'
  8715: Even an adventurer like you wouldn't have a clue where to get a gem like that, would you?${prompt}
  8716: |-
    Any clue about ${item-plural: 1[2]}?
    ${selection-lines}
    I have a pretty good idea.
    Never heard of them.${prompt}
  8717: |-
    No clue, right?
    I think that kid's just stringing me along for a laugh.${prompt}
  8718: |-
    You serious?
    Are you sure you're not just making fun of my feelings, like that Elvaan kid?${prompt}
  8719: |-
    Grrr!
    Just thinking about the smirk on that brat's face...${prompt}
  8720: 'Could I really find out which of those beauties had feelings for me if I had ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}?${prompt}'
  8721: "Nah, things are never that easy. \nThat Elvaan brat is just making fun of me.${prompt}"
  8722: 'Is that really...${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!?${prompt}'
  8723: |-
    I can't believe that kid was telling the truth.
    Well, I'll be damned.${prompt}
  8724: |-
    There's no time to lose.
    I gotta get in there and find the girl of my dreams!${prompt}
  8725: |-
    You ready?
    I'm going in!${prompt}
  8726: I'm looking to buy a necklace...${prompt}
  8727: |-
    Of course, sir!
    Is it a gift for someone special?${prompt}
  8728: Um, yeah...could be...${prompt}
  8729: We have a great selection for you to choose from! Just a moment, sir!${prompt}
  8730: Man, my hands won't stop sweating.${prompt}
  8731: 'So how''s this ${item-singular: 1[2]} supposed to work?${prompt}'
  8732: |-
    Whoa!
    The ${item-singular: 1[2]} changed color!
    Is this what she meant!?${prompt}
  8733: 'This ${item-singular: 1[2]} is one fantastic gem!${prompt}'
  8734: You wandered off before things got interesting, but you shoulda seen the sparks of romance fly between me and Adelflete.${prompt}
  8735: My mind is made up!${prompt}
  8736: |-
    It's more than just knowing that she likes me.
    Now I realize just how much I liked her!${prompt}
  8737: You say you've seen it all before?${prompt}
  8738: |-
    Hahaha!
    Looks like someone has a small case of jealousy.${prompt}
  8739: Well, here's a little present from the happiest man in the world to help cheer you up.${prompt}
  8740: |-
    Hahaha!
    Don't look so glum. The world's full of possibilities, even for you!${prompt}
  8741: |-
    Hahaha!
    I'm sorry, but one look at your face tells the whole story.
    Seeing me with my new girl reminds you of how unlucky you are, right?${prompt}
  8742: |-
    Don't worry, pal! The world's full of possibilities!
    Hahaha!${prompt}
  8743: The customer Adelflete just served--isn't he the man who's always loitering outside the store?${prompt}
  8744: |-
    Did you happen to see the gem he was holding?
    It's a rare stone that changes color depending on the temperature.${prompt}
  8745: |-
    Ah yes, I've seen one before.
    When the person holding it becomes hot and flustered, the hue of the gem changes.${prompt}
  8746: I've heard that it's used in other countries to measure the intensity of a person's feelings.${prompt}
  8747: Which would mean that he's quite taken by our Adelflete, wouldn't it?${prompt}
  8748: |-
    I was wondering who he was after for quite a while now.
    Now we know.${prompt}
  8749: |-
    I can't wait to see what happens.
    It's just like having one of those romantic plays right inside the store!${prompt}
  8750: |-
    What, you want to explore the towers of Pso'Xja?
    That shouldn't be a problem. We recently opened those ruins to all explorers.${prompt}
  8751: However, the Tenshodo is currently conducting an investigation on the deeper areas of the central tower, and we can't have pesky adventurers running around getting in our way.${prompt}
  8752: Though...if you were to scratch our backs, we wouldn't have any problems scratching yours.${prompt}
  8753: It just happens that the Tenshodo is searching for a certain jewel that is very popular in the Near Eastern countries.${prompt}
  8754: What kind of gem is it? Hmmm... Well, they're thin, hexagonally shaped, and come in rare colors like carmine and cyan. I heard that rich people like to decorate their turbans with them.${prompt}
  8755: They even say that sometimes a strange light shoots from their centers, though I've never seen it happen.${prompt}
  8756: Luckily for you, we've been finding a lot of those jewels in the other towers of Pso'Xja.${prompt}
  8757: Unfortunately, some strange device in that place seems to weaken even the strongest of our members. That's where you come in.${prompt}
  8758: Now, if you were to find one of those and bring it back to me, I'm pretty sure I could convince the boss to allow you access to the central tower.${prompt}
  8759: If you want to have access to the deeper parts of Pso'Xja, bring me a jewel from the ruins and I'll see what I can do.${prompt}
  8760: |-
    Hmmm...
    This looks a lot like what we're dealing in, but the color just isn't right. We want something a little more “exotic” than the regular colored gems.${prompt}
  8761: |-
    Well, what do you know?
    This is exactly what we've been looking for.${prompt}
  8762: You know, you're not a bad treasure hunter. Did you ever think of joining the Tenshodo?${prompt}
  8763: |-
    Ah, but you'd probably get bored really quick.
    Anyway, take this pass. It will give you access to the more “sensitive” areas of the ruins.${prompt}
  8764: But I'll warn you one last time--the central tower ruins are still under investigation.${prompt}
  8765: Don't expect any search parties if you happen to get lost.${prompt}
  8766: |-
    Welcome to Neptune's Spire!
    Hm? Oh, I remember you. You're the one that brought us that gem from Pso'Xja.
    After you brought it in, we learned that... Wait, how do I know I can trust you?${prompt}
  8767: |-
    Can you keep a secret?
    ${selection-lines}
    My lips are sealed.
    I can't guarantee anything.${prompt}
  8768: |-
    Then the Tenshodo can't trust you with this info.
    See you around, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady].${prompt}
  8769: |-
    Welcome to Neptune's...
    Ah, look who's back. Did you find some glue for your loose lips?${prompt}
  8770: |-
    If I find out you told anyone about this, I'll... Well, you know what we'll do to you.
    Anyway, about those Pso'Xja gems...${prompt}
  8771: Well, it looks like those jewels aren't just any rocks that fell out of some hole in a mountain.${prompt}
  8772: 'Thanks to adventurers like you, we''ve learned that there are three types: gray, cyan, and carmine--and they all harbor some kind of strange energy that''s not found anywhere else on Vana''diel.${prompt}'
  8773: Also, we've recently received reports from our colleagues in Bastok that the chief Republican engineer, Cid, has been collecting the gems.${prompt}
  8774: Now, if we can find out what power those chips truly hold, the Tenshodo could make a killing!${prompt}
  8775: Oh, and of course you'll get your cut. You're not thinking we'd short-change you, are you?${prompt}
  8776: The IRNC has dispatched me to help support all those who wish to participate in Conflict.${prompt}

  8837: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  8838: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  8839: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  8840: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  8841: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  8842: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  8843: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}

  8849: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  8850: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}

    But how could this be?
    Its power is meantaru to be sealed within a lake of ice--a place in the northeast of Beaucedine Glacier known as “Mirror Pond.”${prompt}

  9257: |-
    What a thing to suggest!
    You insult my professional prrride!${prompt}
  9258: |-
    Alright, alright.
    We'll consider our arrangement canceled for the moment...${prompt}

  9261: |-
    I get the picture.
    You can trrrust me.${prompt}
  9262: ${name-player}, do you remember the story that Palometa told us?${prompt}
  9263: Once there was a meeting of two great masses.${prompt}
  9264: One, an entity of “dark.”${prompt}
  9265: One, an entity of “light.”${prompt}
  9266: Their collision gave birth to a violent storm.${prompt}
  9267: The storm rose towards the heavens, and burst into a million fragments.${prompt}
  9268: |-
    One shard of the storm glittered in the sky.
    One shard of the storm shone below the earth.${prompt}
  9269: |-
    And thus we pray.
    To hold both shards within our hands...${prompt}
  9270: Does this story speak about the battle between the entities of light and dark?${prompt}
  9271: When opposites meet, there is sometimes a violent confrontation.${prompt}
  9272: This is something I've often encountered on my travels.${prompt}
  9273: But these events have been truly surprising...${prompt}
  9274: I always believed myself to be an experienced adventurer.${prompt}
  9275: |-
    I thought that few things could shake me.
    How naive that was...${prompt}
  9276: Since meeting you, I've come face to face with my own shortcomings.${prompt}
  9277: I never believed that having a partner on my travels would teach me so much about myself.${prompt}
  9278: And that's why I want to continue our adventures together.${prompt}
  9279: Our partnership has been the greatest treasure I've ever found...${prompt}
  9280: I hope we can keep exploring the wonders of this world side by side, and improve our skills as adventurers.${prompt}
  9281: |-
    ${name-player}...
    I always thought that adventuring lacked a certain punch.${prompt}
  9282: I wanted to be in the middle of some huge event--to meet someone with as much zest as me!${prompt}
  9283: ${name-player}, do you remember the story that Palometa told us?${prompt}
  9284: Once there was a meeting of two great masses.${prompt}

  9291: When I heard this tale, I thought, “This is just what I'm looking for!”${prompt}
  9292: I guess what I'm trying to say is that following the guidance of my mirror and giving you the signal pearl was the right choice.${prompt}
  9293: To tell the truth, I doubted the powers of the mirror at first.${prompt}
  9294: But after listening to Palometa's story, I was glad that I trusted in the Glass of All-Seeing.${prompt}
  9295: Looking back, these past events have been just the kind of excitement I needed.${prompt}
  9296: The mirror is a great treasure--that's for sure!${prompt}
  9297: But I value the friendship we've made even more!${prompt}
  9298: You hold on to that pearl, you hear me, ${name-player}!?${prompt}
  9299: I felt a strange power within the Glass of All-Seeing from the first moment I picked it up.${prompt}
  9300: Since meeting Palometa, that sensation continued to grow...${prompt}
  9301: Until finally I wasn't sure if it was the mirror giving off these waves, or something else entirely...${prompt}
  9302: I couldn't figure it out.${prompt}
  9303: I even felt this supernatural force when adventuring with you.${prompt}

  9312: This tale made everything clear to me.${prompt}
  9313: When the bearer of the Mirror of Blighted Gloom meets the wielder of the Glass of Blessed Radiance, something huge is supposed to happen.${prompt}
  9314: The power I felt was a premonition of the brewing storm.${prompt}
  9315: Looking back, that story was almost prophetic.${prompt}
  9316: But it was thanks to you that we came through this storm unharmed.${prompt}
  9317: You have my thanks.${prompt}
  9318: If anything like this ever happens again, I mean to stand and face it by your side.${prompt}
  9319: Don't ever forget that.${prompt}

  9328: You can certainly feel the conviction of the people who composed this tale...${prompt}
  9329: Do you not think so?${prompt}
  9330: I wonder if the guiding power of the mirror was born from these people's thoughts.${prompt}
  9331: What could they possibly be trying to lead us to?${prompt}
  9332: In any event, the Glass of All-Seeing has taken me on an amazing journey.${prompt}
  9333: And having you accompany me has only enriched the experience.${prompt}
  9334: The glass lies dormant now...${prompt}
  9335: But even without its guidance...${prompt}
  9336: I hope to continue my adventures with you.${prompt}

    This talk of two great masses, and a violent storm...
    Sounds like a battle, don't you think?${prompt}
  9347: But then, what could the fragments be referring to?${prompt}
  9348: The fragments that were born of our recent battle...${prompt}
  9349: Could they be the bonds of friendship that grew between Luto, Palometa, and ourselves?${prompt}
  9350: (And the two shards...)${prompt}
  9351: (Perhaps they are you and me? Is this wishful thinking?)${prompt}
  9352: |-
    Whatever this all means, I'm glad to have met everyone.
    I will always treasure the friendship that has developed between all of us.${prompt}
  9353: |-
    One more thing, ${name-player}.
    This is embarrassing, but...${prompt}
  9354: I...I want to always be able to adventure with you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9355: And...I hope you feel the same way.${prompt}

    I just wanted to let you know.

  9365: When I heard this story for the first time, a tingle ran down my spine...${prompt}
  9366: I felt as though the Glass of All-Seeing had guided me all my life to arrive at that very moment.${prompt}
  9367: I just knew that a life-changing experience had been set in motion.${prompt}
  9368: Since arriving in Jeuno, I've met so many people and survived so many incidents, I'm starting to lose track.${prompt}
  9369: 'But there is one thing I''ll never forget: the time we first met.${prompt}'
  9370: You appeared before me at the Eldieme Necropolis, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9371: |-
    This might sound a little exaggerated, but never before had I felt destiny so keenly.
    It was as though the mirror wanted me to meet you, ${name-player}.${prompt}

  9373: |-
    Sounds incredible, doesn't it?
    But it's true.${prompt}
  9374: |-
    I've never enjoyed adventuring as much as when I'm with you, ${name-player}.
    I simply cannot recall how I managed to get by until we met.${prompt}
  9375: Promise me we'll be friends forever, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9376: At first, I was only interested in the Glass of All-Seeing's beauty.${prompt}
  9377: But over time, the images it showed me became the focus of my journey.${prompt}
  9378: Following its guidance led me to you, Luto, and Palometa.${prompt}
  9379: I'm so glad Palometa was able to regain her father's mirror.${prompt}
  9380: And I'm also thrilled that the blessed radiance was restored to my looking glass.${prompt}

  9392: Can we assume that the mirrors are safe now that our opponent has been defeated?${prompt}
  9393: |-
    I certainly hope so.
    And I hope Palometa will know peace in her life from now on.${prompt}
  9394: She's seen so much strife for one so young...${prompt}
  9395: We've been traveling together for so long now that I don't think I can go back to being alone.${prompt}
  9396: But you'll keep adventuring alongside me, won't you, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  9397: I know you'll never let me down.${prompt}

    But of course, I'm not gonna give it up!

    I was no different...${prompt}
  9422: But then I found the Glass of All-Seeing...${prompt}

  9424: Ever since I began adventuring with you, however...${prompt}

  9442: '...Then the end of my journey was Palometa.${prompt}'
  9443: I couldn't believe it when we learned she was gonna be the guardian of her father's mirror.${prompt}

  9445: But even though you're not the person I was fated to meet, you're still an irreplaceable part of my life.${prompt}
  9446: So, listen up!${prompt}
  9447: I want us to keep on adventuring together.${prompt}

  9539: You know the ships at Mhaura used t' transport prospective mercenaries to the Near East? If you want t' climb aboard one o' those vessels, you 'ave got to go through none other than the Tenshodo here.${prompt}
  9540: We received a request from the Empire 'erself. Getting those ships t' port was a royal pain. We finally managed t' bargain a cheap price on some rickety old vessels, and...${prompt}
  9541: And you don't care. Sorry abou' that. A man's got to vent sometimes.${prompt}
  9542: Anyway, you should know by now how things work around 'ere. If you want something, you 'ave to bring me something I want, first.${prompt}
  9543: If you aren't in the mood t' scavenge up what I want, you can always cough up gil instead. O' course, that would be quickest.${prompt}
  9544: Let's make this explanation brief, shall we?${prompt}
  9545: You see, prices are a mite different in the Near East. Something that sells for a gil a dozen here might be a luxury item in Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  9546: |-
    Jumping straigh' to the point, now.
    I want you t' bring me some common items from this side o' Vana'diel, and I'll give you the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} in exchange.${prompt}
  9547: The more you bring me, the better. I 'ave put together a few lists if you'd like to take a look. I will leave it t' you which to bring me.${prompt}

  9554: |-
    The advanced list, eh? A superb choice. The items on this list are few, so they should fit nicely in your bag, but they are quite difficult t' come by.
    You can choose from the following:${prompt}
  9555: One coffer key from a beastman stronghold--Davoi, Beadeaux, Castle Oztroja, the Temple of Uggalepih, the Den of Rancor, the Quicksand Caves, or the Sea Serpent Grotto.${prompt}
  9556: A “testimony.” Those ancient scraps of papyrus seem t' be quite popular with collectors these days. I don't know all the details, but apparently there's a testimony for any o' the jobs an adventurer can be. Anyway, I just need one.${prompt}
  9557: Your last option is t' bring me chips from Pso'Xja.${prompt}
  9558: 'I''ll need a set o'' those, though. You''ll ''ave to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, all three.${prompt}'
  9559: |-
    That's it for the advanced list.
    You can bring me any one o' the above requests, but if you decide t' bring Pso'Xja chips, I'll need 'em in a set o' three.${prompt}
  9560: |-
    Intermediate, eh?
    This one is quite a bother.${prompt}
  9561: Beastmen 'ave been a real plague t' the Near East as of late. Not that we haven't been having problems here, too.${prompt}
  9562: But anyway, the situation 'as driven up the demand for beastman spoils.${prompt}
  9563: 'I want you t'' bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  9564: The beastmen have been using those t' relay orders. I require all three.${prompt}
  9565: |-
    That's all for the intermediate list.
    It may sound simple, but those items are scattered all about the strongholds and are rather difficult t' get a hold of.${prompt}
  9566: You say you want t' go to Aht Urhgan, but you're too big o' a coward to face a challenge, eh? That attitude will get you nowhere in the Empire, I tell you. Ah well, it's all the same t' me, as long as I make a profit.${prompt}
  9567: This will be more like running errands, but there are a lot o' things for you to collect on this list.${prompt}
  9568: 'There are a lot o'' curious items here. I need you to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt}'

    I'm not picking on you, so don't get your feathers in a ruffle.${prompt}
  9572: 'So you are going t'' pay me ${number: 0} gil. Is that correct?${prompt}'

    Ah, it's you again.
    Did you make it t' Aht Urhgan in one piece? Sorry for catching you by surprise earlier.${prompt}
  9595: I'm not sure if you know this or not, but Aht Urhgan has a pact forbidding airships from flying over their nation.${prompt}
  9596: O' course, we found a way around that, and dropped you into that ginormous forest from the sky. The Tenshodo'll always give you your money's worth.${prompt}

  9620: Venture roll is a competitive game played with dice similar to those used by corsairs. The objective is to roll until your cumulative total comes as close to 11 as possible without going over.${prompt}
  9621: 'Until you reach or go over 11, you may continue rolling (${color: 5}doubling up${color: 1}) as many times as the table time limit allows (${number: 8} ${choice-plurality: 8}[minute/minutes], Earth time).${prompt}'

  9623: If your total ever goes over 11, you will automatically lose the game, regardless of the totals of other players. Knowing the right time to hold fast is one of the keys to staying in the match.${prompt}
  9624: Once all the players have held fast, the game is over and the results are announced. The player closest to 11 is declared the winner and receives all the gil in the pot (the original participation fees of all the players).${prompt}

    Moblin Maze Mongers is the revolutionary new business venture that's taking Vana'diel by storm!
    Making ingenious use of previously neglected caverns beneath Mindartia and Quon, our expert staff will create the perfect dungeon for you and your fellow adventurers!${prompt}
  9812: Use one of our state-of-the-art “Maze Tabulae” to lay out the guidelines, and sit back as our craftsmen dig and delve to your demanding specifications!${prompt}
  9813: Your maze will also be populated with a plethora of foul fiends and all manner of devious devices, all of which can also be customized to your liking!${prompt}
  9814: |-
    The maze you design may be a relaxed jaunt for the novice adventurer, or it may be a diabolical demesne that will challenge even the most battle-hardened adventurers.
    With control over almost every aspect of your creation, the choice is yours!${prompt}

    Moblin Maze Mongers makes designing your own dungeon quick and painless!
    With three simple-to-use items--“Maze Tabulae,” “Maze Vouchers,” and “Maze Runes”--you'll be a mazebuilding master in no time.${prompt}
  9817: The first and most important of these items is the “Maze Tabula,” which stores the layout and content of your maze. By using other items in conjunction with the Maze Tabula, you can customize various elements of your dungeon.${prompt}
  9818: Next you have the “Maze Voucher,” a construction order that specifies the objectives that must be met to successfully complete your maze.${prompt}
  9819: |-
    After receiving your Maze Voucher, we will proceed to build a maze according to your specifications.
    However, the Maze Voucher only dictates the final objectives for your dungeon--other details may be left to the whims of our craftsmen.${prompt}
  9820: |-
    You'd rather customize the nitty-gritty details yourself, you say? Fear not!
    That's where “Maze Runes” come in.
    The use of Maze Runes is completely optional, and is intended for detail-oriented adventurers who want more direct control over their creation.${prompt}
  9821: |-
    Be aware, however, that certain combinations of Maze Runes and Maze Vouchers are incompatible with each other, while others might produce unintended effects.
    Still, the possibilities are nearly limitless, so clients are encouraged to experiment!${prompt}
  9822: You may notice that certain Maze Tabulae contain blackened squares, or squares containing elemental symbols.${prompt}

    Black squares indicate squares that cannot hold Maze Runes.

    Elemental squares will enhance the effect of any Maze Runes they come in contact with.
    Such Maze Runes will exert a far greater influence on your maze than under typical circumstances.${prompt}
  9825: |-
    The concept of elemental opposition does not apply to the Maze Tabula.
    Provided that at least one compatible element exists, the Maze Rune in question will see its effect augmented.${prompt}
  9826: After customizing your dungeon with the three items described above, please trade your completed Maze Tabula to the Maze Monger Shopfront.${prompt}
  9827: Once your Maze Tabula is confirmed and you've paid the necessary excavation and construction fee, you and your companions will be escorted posthaste to your brand-spanking new, custom-built maze!${prompt}
  9828: 'Customers should know that due to high demand for the Maze Mongers'' services, only one maze order can be accepted from any single adventurer per ${choice: 0}[twenty hours/one hour] (Earth time).${prompt}'
  9829: |-
    However, there are no restrictions placed on using mazes created by other adventurers.
    Adventurers who would like to take on multiple mazes a day are strongly encouraged to cooperate with their friends.${prompt}
  9830: This section will explain the procedure for adventuring in your custom-built maze from start to finish, entrance to exit!${prompt}
  9831: |-
    After your order has been accepted and paid for, you and your companions will be escorted to the maze lobby.
    Please wait here patiently until the construction process is completed.${prompt}
  9832: |-
    During this time, our lead foreman Packapic will provide you with a brief overview of the facilities.
    You will also be given the opportunity to purchase maze-specific items should you so desire.${prompt}
  9833: |-
    After construction has completed, our gatekeeper and guide Rediroq will lead you and your companions into the maze.
    The challenge begins!${prompt}
  9834: "Should you manage to successfully complete the conditions specified on the Maze Voucher, a treasure chest will appear somewhere within the maze. \nWhat myriad riches may lie inside? You'll just have to see for yourself!${prompt}"
  9835: |-
    After successfully retrieving your reward, you are free to exit the maze.
    You may do so by any one of the following methods:${prompt}
  9836: "”Leaving From the Exit”\nEach maze will contain an exit door with a Maze Monger attendant posted in the vicinity. \nIf spoken to, this attendant will lead all participants out of the maze.${prompt}"
  9837: Located near the exit is a beacon. Attendants have been instructed to trigger this as soon as the maze objectives have been successfully met, so you may use it as a guide in the event that you are unsure of your progress.${prompt}
  9838: |-
    “Using a ${item-singular: 0[2]}”
    A complimentary ${item-singular: 0[2]} will be presented to you free of charge before you enter the maze.
    Using this will cause the adventurer who used it--and that person alone--to be transported out of the maze.${prompt}
  9839: |-
    “Emergency Extraction”
    Should unforeseen circumstances occur that are deemed to present an imminent danger to maze participants, Moblin Maze Mongers staff reserve the right to perform an emergency rescue operation to remove all participants from the maze.${prompt}
  9840: |-
    Now you have all the necessary knowledge to enjoy your custom maze!
    Happy spelunking!${prompt}
  9841: Clients should be aware of the following rules and regulations governing the use of Maze Monger mazes.${prompt}
  9842: Adventurers who flee from a given maze without completing the stated objectives will not be permitted to re-enter that same maze.${prompt}
  9843: |-
    Upon completing the objectives, a treasure chest is guaranteed to appear somewhere within the maze.
    Please do not forget to seek it out and claim your reward before exiting the dungeon.${prompt}
  9844: "Maze difficulty will, in principle, be tailored to the highest level adventurer in the event that a party contains adventurers of disparate skill levels. \nNote, however, that there may be exceptions to this depending on the objectives specified on your Maze Voucher.${prompt}"
  9845: |-
    We at Moblin Maze Mongers strongly encourage building and exploring mazes in parties.
    While we will not refuse solo clients, please be aware that completing the maze objectives alone may prove to be a difficult task.${prompt}
  9846: "Our expert craftsmen take the highest pride in the safety and stability of their work. \nPlease understand, however, that due to the inherent tectonic instability of subterranean caverns, we cannot rule out the possibility of collapses or cave-ins occurring over the course of time.${prompt}"
  9847: |-
    In such cases, we reserve the right to initiate emergency rescue operations that will instantly transport all clients outside the maze to safety.
    Moblin Maze Mongers will accept no responsibility for treasures left unclaimed as a result of such a rescue operation, so adventurers are encouraged--for their own benefit--to proceed through the maze in a timely fashion.${prompt}
  9848: In addition to the treasures to be gained within mazes, adventurers will also receive special tokens called “Moblin Marbles” as a reward for the successful completion of a maze.${prompt}
  9849: These Moblin Marbles can be exchanged at the Maze Mongers office for a wide variety of exciting, exclusive goods and prizes!${prompt}
  9850: How about a nice, shiny one of these?${prompt}
  9851: Or a spiffy, sparkling one of these?${prompt}
  9852: Rack up enough Moblin Marbles, and there's a veritable cornucopia of prizes to be had!${prompt}
  9853: |-
    And that's not all--Moblin Marbles can also be used to purchase other benefits!
    These include the ability to register your completed Maze Tabulae and share your creations with adventurers far and wide, or an assortment of official designations.${prompt}
  9854: Accumulate as many as you can and make the most of your maze-mongering experience!${prompt}
  9855: |-
    There's only one copy, so don't ye go carryin' it off now.
    Jus' come back here if ye need t'look at it again.${prompt}
  9856: |-
    Hmmmm...so ye want t'order a maze, do ye?${wait-36: 1}
    Sorry, but our mazes aren't fer you greenhorn types.
    Come back when ye've seen more of the world, why don't ye?${prompt}
  9857: |-
    Thanks to the loyal patronage of adventurers like you, business is positively booming here at Moblin Maze Mongers!
    We've been so successful, in fact, that unscrupulous rival corporations have sprung up trying to cash in on our profits!${prompt}
  9858: |-
    With great success, though, comes great responsibility!
    Here at Moblin Maze Mongers, we are dedicated to preserving the pristine subterranean environment that makes our unique service possible.
    Regrettably, this means there are times when we must temporarily close our mazes for necessary maintenance.${prompt}
  9859: |-
    At the same time, Moblin Maze Mongers always puts you, the customer, first!
    How can we reward our loyal customers for their part in keeping our caves clean and tectonically sound?
    Here's how: with our all-new Cave Conservation (C.C.) point system!${prompt}
  9860: "Customers will receive their first C.C. point ${choice: 0}[thirty-two hours/one hour and twenty minutes] (Earth time) after exiting a maze they have created, with another point being added every ${choice: 0}[eight hours/twenty minutes] (Earth time) thereafter. \nA maximum of six points may be accumulated at any one time.${prompt}"
  9861: |-
    And what will C.C. points earn you? More loot, that's what!
    Ordering a maze with C.C. points in your possession will result in the appearance of an additional, bonus treasure chest upon completion of your objectives! The contents will vary based upon your Maze Voucher, with greater riches awaiting you for each C.C. point you've accumulated.${prompt}
  9862: |-
    Please be aware that your C.C. points will be reset to zero upon ordering a new maze.
    Any treasure that goes unclaimed will revert to the property of Moblin Maze Mongers. No returns, no refunds.${prompt}
  9863: |-

  9953: To avoid raising alarm bells, we've planted a life-size talking doll-ethy of the doctor at her abode and imbued it with a personality that's equally abrasive-ethy, but the people won't be fooled for long.${prompt}
  9954: We must act, and act fast-ethy, lest all of this becomes public knowledge and mass panic-ethy grips the land!${prompt}
  9955: Certainly not the kind of predicament you want to get dragged into should you wish to live to a ripe old age...
  9956: But as much as I'm loath to admit it, we--myself and all adventurers included--are already involved up to our necks.${prompt}
  9957: Whatever devious scheme that Domina Shantotto is plotting, it would be naive to assume that she has any less than the whole of Vana'diel in her sights.${prompt}
  9958: Now, I think it's safe to say that we're all agreed that action must be taken.${prompt}
  9959: But what should our first step be to avert this clear and present danger?${prompt}
  9960: Let me first tell-ethy you what else I know.${prompt}
  9961: Upon learning of the teleportation mishap-ethy, I sought to locate the whereabouts of the original-ethy Doctor Shantotto. I deduced that the clone-ethy might have had a hand in her disappearance.${prompt}
  9962: And sure-ethy enough, my sources have revealed that the original doctor is being held captive-ethy somewhere in Ro'Maeve.${prompt}
  9963: I propose-ethy that our first act is the rescue of “Original Shantotto”--for the sake of convenience, let's call-ethy her by this moniker for the time being.${prompt}
  9964: 'Ah, I see where you''re going with this: fight fire with fire!${prompt}'
  9965: It sounds like our best bet. The odds would be greatly improved if we had the original Shantotto fighting on our side.${prompt}
  9966: ${name-player}, I trust I can rely on your full cooperation in this.${prompt}
  9967: Let's be on our way!${prompt}
  9968: I trust I can rely on your full cooperation in rescuing the original Doctor Shantotto.${prompt}
  9969: According to Professor Yoran-Oran, the doctor is being held captive in Ro'Maeve.${prompt}
  9970: “A perfect world order...${prompt}
  9971: '...that exists solely for our pleasure”!?${prompt}'

  9973: |-
    <Puff...wheeze...>
    Th-the doctor's location-ethy! I have it!${prompt}
  9974: As a last resort, I employed the services of Windurst's infamous Cat Burglar-ethy, Nanaa Mihgo, to locate Doctor Shantotto.${prompt}
  9975: 'And true-ethy to her reputation, she''s successfully tracked down the doctor''s current hideout-ethy: the Sacrificial Chamber within the Temple of Uggalepih!${prompt}'
  9976: The only hitch-ethy is--and acquiring this piece of information further lightened my coin purse-ethy--ancient artifacts known as “Tablets of Hexes” are required for entry. They can supposedly be found-ethy scattered throughout the temple and deeper within.${prompt}
  9977: Ah, yes. The Cat Burglar has never been one to lose scent of her prey.${prompt}
  9978: So the next leg of our journey takes us to Elshimo Island...${prompt}
  9979: By means fair or foul, we must put an end to Shantotto's nefarious plot.${prompt}
  9980: Vana'diel must not be allowed to fall into such tyrannical hands!${prompt}
  9981: |-
    But first, there are matters I must attend to in Jeuno.
    I must ensure that the Tenshodo isn't left leaderless should...should the worst come to pass.${prompt}
  9982: One can't expect to lock horns with a fearsome adversary like the doctor and come out unscathed.${prompt}
  9983: Very well-ethy. Let us rendezvous at the Sacrificial Chamber.
  9984: |-
    There are matters I must settle here first before departure.
    The Tenshodo mustn't be left leaderless should the worst come to pass.${prompt}

  10052: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt}
  10053: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  10054: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt}
  10055: |-
    Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.
    If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt}
  10056: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  10057: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  10058: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  10059: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  10060: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  10061: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  10062: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  10063: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  10064: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  10065: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  10066: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10067: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  10068: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  10069: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  10070: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  10071: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  10072: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  10073: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  10074: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  10075: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10076: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  10077: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  10078: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  10079: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  10080: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  10081: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  10082: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  10083: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  10084: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  10085: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  10086: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  10087: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  10088: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  10089: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  10090: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  10091: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  10092: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  10093: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  10094: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  10095: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  10096: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  10097: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  10098: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  10099: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  10100: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  10101: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10102: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  10103: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  10104: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  10105: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  10106: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  10107: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  10108: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  10109: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  10110: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  10111: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  10112: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  10113: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  10114: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  10115: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  10116: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  10117: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  10118: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  10119: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  10120: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  10121: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  10122: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  10123: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  10124: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  10125: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  10126: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  10127: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  10128: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  10129: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  10130: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  10131: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  10132: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  10133: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  10134: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  10135: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?
    Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  10136: |-
    A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know.

    ...Alas.
    It's a shame, but it appears your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be etched.${prompt}

  10155: |-
    I thought you'd never ask!
    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  10156: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  10157: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'
  10158: |-
    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  10159: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  10160: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  10161: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  10162: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  10163: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  10164: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}
  10165: |-
    That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.
    Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt}

  10281: I wish you the best of luck in this endeavor.${prompt}
  10282: The government of Jeuno has promulgated a system for adventurers to pioneer uncharted lands.${prompt}
  10283: This system was proposed by the leaders of the Sacred City of Adoulin, an overseas trading capital whose volume of trade rivals Jeuno's.${prompt}
  10284: Pioneers are to traverse the waters of the Sea of Zafmlug, far to the west, and assist in colonizing the untamed wilds of Ulbuka.${prompt}
  10285: Once word of this proposal reached San d'Oria through various trade routes, it introduced Jeuno to the idea, which led to its eventual implementation.${prompt}
  10286: Adoulin is not a place for the weak or uninitiated. Harsh wildlands surround the city, and simple layfolk stand no chance of surviving. It is due to these unique circumstances that Adoulin has begun recruiting highly seasoned adventurers to assist in seeing out its goals.${prompt}
  10287: Here at the Consultation Desk, we issue permits that allow proactive adventurers to cross over to Adoulin.${prompt}
  10288: However, neophytes cannot provide the services Adoulin requires. As such, the Chamber has commissioned a simple test for those seeking to make the perilous journey.${prompt}
  10289: Those seasoned in battle should find it to be a relatively painless affair.${prompt}

  10294: 'You must simply pass the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} over the markings located in the area to finish your assignment.${prompt}'
  10295: 'Once you have completed this task, simply return the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to us here and we will analyze the results.${prompt}'
  10296: 'Should your trial be completed appropriately, you will be deemed to have passed, and will be issued ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, enabling you to travel to Adoulin.${prompt}'
  10297: That should constitute a sufficient explanation. Should you choose to undertake the test, I wish you the greatest of fortunes.${prompt}
  10298: As you may remember, the test requires you to visit one of several different dungeons.${prompt}
  10299: To be quite frank, we have received a large number of signatures from the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network. Evidently, what with all the adventurers coming and going, they need some help with non-battle activities as well.${prompt}
  10300: 'Given that, the committee deliberated day and night to come up with a solution. As a result of this grueling debacle, an executive decision was made to issue special tickets for the price of ${number: 1} gil.${prompt}'
  10301: The committee based its judgment on the idea that accumulating funds is yet another sign of a stalwart adventurer.${prompt}
  10302: After all, Adoulin is a city of maritime trade, just like our beloved Jeuno. We recognize that it welcomes business skill in all its forms, without regard to race or creed.${prompt}

  10315: Passing it over the surface of the portal will enable you to warp to Adoulin.${prompt}
  10316: Warping is not free, however; the process requires a certain type of energy.${prompt}
  10317: According to my materials, trading crystals to a waypoint will convert them into energy. This process is called “charging.”${prompt}
  10318: 'The energy, referred to as “kinetic units,” is recorded on the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} I have given you.${prompt}'
  10319: Utilizing the waypoints will deplete a portion of these kinetic units each time, so I recommend periodic recharging.${prompt}
  10320: It says here that all I have imparted to you may be reviewed at any time from any waypoint.${prompt}
  10321: Of course, in consideration of all your help, the one I have given you is fully charged. I hope that you put it to good use.${prompt}
  10322: That is all the information with which I can provide you. Your adventures in Adoulin will be what you make of them--and we have high hopes you will make a positive contribution to the development of the nation and the success of the pioneering initiative.${prompt}

  10425: It's in the drawer, as always. Go back there and have them bring it out.${prompt}
  10426: So? How've you been?${prompt}
  10427: You know how it is. Always in search of something juicy that'll make some quick gil.${prompt}

    From Mid...
    So you've come all the way from Adoulin, then?${prompt}
  10434: Aha--you applied for that pioneer nonsense, did you?${prompt}
  10435: |-
    Well, what you do is your business.
    Let me see what Mid had you bring.${prompt}
  10436: '${color-alt: 15}You hand over ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} and ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}.'
  10437: Oh ho, he made a new kind of explosive, did he?${prompt}

    Using a chemical reaction to set things in motion...

    Somehow I don't think he meant for us to have this.
    What could he possibly be on about?${prompt}
  10442: Boss, if Cid were to find out about this...${prompt}
  10443: Oh, I know all too well. His rage would be the least of our worries. Mid might even get himself expelled from Adoulin entirely.${prompt}
  10444: But we shouldn't stick our noses where they don't belong.${prompt}
  10445: This whole affair must never leave these walls. Consider that to be a direct order.${prompt}
  10446: That goes for you too, ${name-player}. Pretend this whole thing didn't happen.${prompt}
  10447: I'll hold on to this. Nothing good could come of giving it back to Mid.${prompt}
  10448: Now, about those explosives--we'll have to do some research on our own before we give a definitive answer. That's our official response.${prompt}
  10449: So head back to Adoulin and let Midras know...only what he needs to know. And don't get in over your head, hear?${prompt}

  10455: There are many other weapons imbued with the power of runes. Of course, I own all of the ones that can be equipped.${prompt}

  10457: 'As for the ones I can''t equip, the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and the ${item-singular: 6[2]}, I was able to sell it for a pretty good price at the bazaar.${prompt}'
  10458: At any rate, it was worth the trouble of decoding the device's password.${prompt}
  10459: |-
    What do you want to ask about?
    ${selection-lines}
    The Strange Apparatus.
    The password.
    Tell me the password.
    Farewell.${prompt}
  10460: See you around.${prompt}
  10461: Huh? You mean you've never heard of a Strange Apparatus?${prompt}
  10462: 'They''re a type of mysterious device hidden in ${zone: 1[2]} as well as ${zone: 2[2]} and ${zone: 3[2]}, among other places.${prompt}'
  10463: Of course, I have no idea what such things are doing in caves, ruins, and the like.${prompt}
  10464: A password is necessary in order to grant you doctor status, which provides you with the necessary access privileges for the device.${prompt}
  10465: 'You can then place materials in the device to generate ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10466: Of course, you're not always guaranteed to get a weapon.${prompt}
  10467: Once you obtain the necessary access privileges, though, it boosts the chances a weapon will be synthesized, if only by a little bit.${prompt}
  10468: Huh? You want me to just give you the password I worked so hard to crack?${prompt}
  10469: That's a secret I risked my life against deadly elementals to learn.${prompt}
  10470: There's no way I could just tell you for free. Now, if we could agree on suitable compensation...${prompt}
  10471: Actually, you need MP to wield this weapon properly.${prompt}
  10472: For a Galkan warrior like myself, it's a constant struggle to keep up the necessary MP.${prompt}
  10473: 'So, if you can bring me ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, I suppose I could tell you the secret behind the password.${prompt}'
  10474: Very well. As promised, I'll tell you the secret behind the password.${prompt}
  10475: Okay, now listen carefully. The password consists of eight numbers in total, and you need to split it up into four sections of two digits each.${prompt}
  10476: First, you need to take the first three letters of your name and use them to generate a series of two-digit numbers based on their position in the alphabet.${prompt}
  10477: The letter A starts at “00,” B is “01,” and so on, until you reach Z at “25.”${prompt}
  10478: Furthermore, the area containing each device has been assigned an elemental, with each elemental given a numerical code.${prompt}
  10479: If the elemental is Fire, the number is “0,”, while Earth is “1,” until you reach Dark at “7.”${prompt}
  10480: Next, you need to take the value for the elemental and add it to each of your first three numbers. That will give you the first three values.${prompt}
  10481: For the fourth value, you need to add your first three values together and then add the elemental value as well.${prompt}
  10482: If the number exceeds 100, simply take the last two digits.${prompt}
  10483: Therefore, these four sets of numbers you calculated will become your eight-digit password.${prompt}
  10484: 'I suppose it''s still a bit difficult to comprehend. How about an example, then? Say you''re trying to register the password in ${zone: 1[2]}...${prompt}'
  10485: 'The first three letters of your name are ${entity: 0}, and the elemental for the device is ${choice: 6}[Fire/Earth/Water/Wind/Ice/Lightning/Light/Dark]...${prompt}'
  10486: 'Therefore, the numerical values for your name are ${number-2-digits: 0}, ${number-2-digits: 1}, and ${number-2-digits: 2}, and the elemental value is ${number: 3}.${prompt}'
  10487: 'That means the first three values are ${number-2-digits: 0}, ${number-2-digits: 1}, and ${number-2-digits: 2}.${prompt}'
  10488: 'The fourth value is created by adding the values for your name to that of the elemental for the area, which gives you ${number-2-digits: 3}.${prompt}'
  10489: 'The fourth value is created by adding the values for your name to that of the elemental for the area, which gives you ${number-2-digits: 4}. However, since it exceeds 100, the value becomes ${number-2-digits: 3}.${prompt}'
  10490: 'Putting all of these values together gives you ${number-2-digits: 0}${number-2-digits: 1}${number-2-digits: 2}${number-2-digits: 3}, which is your password to register your access privileges with the device.${prompt}'
  10491: Did you get all that?${prompt}
  10492: |-
    Got it?
    ${selection-lines}
    No problem!
    I'm not very good with numbers.${prompt}
  10493: Okay then. Now you know how to find your password.${prompt}
  10494: As for what materials to place in the device, you'll need to research that for yourself.${prompt}
  10495: Were you even paying attention? Fine, I'll give you the short version.${prompt}
  10496: Tell me. Which area are you planning to register in?${prompt}
  10497: |-
    Where are you planning to register?
    ${selection-lines}
    ${zone: 0[2]}.

    ${zone: 5[2]}.
    ${zone: 6[2]}.
    ${zone: 7[2]}.
    Never mind.${prompt}
  10498: Give me a moment while I make the necessary calculations.${prompt}
  10499: 'Okay, I''ve got it. Your password for registering your access privileges with the device in ${zone: 6[2]} is ${number-2-digits: 0}${number-2-digits: 1}${number-2-digits: 2}${number-2-digits: 3}.${prompt}'
  10500: Now hurry up and get over there before you forget it.${prompt}
  10501: Very well. Come see me again when you decide on a location.${prompt}
  10502: What do you want?${prompt}
  10503: |-
    What do you want to ask?
    ${selection-lines}
    Tell me how to calculate the password.
    Just tell me the password.
    Never mind.${prompt}
  10504: Oh... You're the one I recently told how to obtain the password.${prompt}
  10505: It seems you were able to receive the necessary access privileges for the device.${prompt}
  10506: It seems like we have quite a bit in common.${prompt}
  10507: 'There''s no use trying to hide it. I could tell by the way you were looking at my ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10508: You managed to receive the necessary access privileges with the Strange Apparatus. Am I right?${prompt}
  10509: If so, I've got some interesting news for you. Care to hear it?${prompt}
  10510: |-
    Do you want to hear the info?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure.
    No thanks.${prompt}
  10511: I see... In that case, farewell.${prompt}
  10512: Hehe... I thought you might want to hear this.${prompt}
  10513: You've been granted access privileges, so I'm sure you already know this, but there are other Strange Apparatuses that haven't been activated yet.${prompt}
  10514: 'Apparently, the device in ${zone: 1[2]} just became operational recently.${prompt}'
  10515: Upon hearing the rumors, I went to check it out for myself...${prompt}
  10516: However, it asked me for a new password.${prompt}
  10517: I suppose it's requiring us to register for access privileges granted to those a rank above doctor status...${prompt}
  10518: I'm assuming that the values for the name are the same, and only the elemental value has changed, but I still haven't figured it out yet.${prompt}
  10519: If you manage to figure it out before I do, maybe you could give me a hint on how to crack the password.${prompt}
  10520: I'm sure it'll be fairly difficult, but I'd appreciate the help.${prompt}
  10521: Huh? Did you manage to figure out the new password!?${prompt}
  10522: I see... It looks like you beat me to it.${prompt}
  10523: So, enough with the suspense... What's the secret?${prompt}
  10524: Wait. Don't tell me. I don't want to know.${prompt}
  10525: I remember how I felt when I cracked the secret for the doctor-level password.${prompt}
  10526: It was tough, but the sheer joy I felt after it was over was worth it in the end.${prompt}
  10527: I would hate to have that sense of accomplishment taken away from me.${prompt}
  10528: If you could figure it out, I know I can too. Just you wait.${prompt}
  10529: Instead of the elemental value, I could take this... And then if I add that to the total...${prompt}
  10530: 'Hey, have you heard the rumors that the device in ${zone: 1[2]} is operational?${prompt}'
  10531: I see. I was trying to figure out the secret behind its password.${prompt}
  10532: Sorry, I'm too busy to talk right now. Maybe come back later when I've figured it out.${prompt}
  10533: Hello, ${name-player}. What brings you here today?${prompt}

  10535: Hmm... This is...${prompt}
  10536: I had heard that it was related to some ancient technology, but now it all makes sense...${prompt}
  10537: I suppose your intention here is to use the A.M.A.N. to have its adventurers solve the riddle.${prompt}
  10538: As such, I suppose it's best if I give you free reign to operate, ${name-player}.${prompt}

  10733: Put a sock in it, Rrrolandienne!${prompt}
  10734: I apologize. I simply got carried away in the moment...${prompt}
  10735: |-
    Ah...
    H-hello, ${name-player}.${prompt}

    Anything to say?

    What's going on?
    Oooh, I love cat fights!${prompt}
  10737: I'm sorry you had to witness that unsavory-wavory display. It's just that...${prompt}
  10738: Sorry, but I'm not in the mood to play along with your japes today. To spare me the embarrassmentaru of you guessing what happened, let me tell you instead.${prompt}
  10739: These two just got done entreataruing me to help with an objective.${prompt}
  10740: That's the crrrux of the matter, at least.${prompt}
  10741: We believe that it is a tad difficult for us to carry out on our own, so we came to discuss the issue with Nantoto.${prompt}
  10742: |-
    But I'm not interested in rewards or spoils at all!
    And that's why you came to me... You knew you'd get half the pie for a third of the effortaru!${prompt}
  10743: Those catty rrremarks of yours couldn't be further from the truth. We're not trying to take advantage of you one bit.${prompt}
  10744: At any rate, we shall return when you are in a less ill humor.${prompt}
  10745: Cheerrrio, Toto!${prompt}
  10746: Haaah... I'm so drain-wained.${prompt}
  10747: At least I know you're not pretending-wending to be my friend to wring gil out of me, ${name-player}. I knew from the start you only cared about the reward.${prompt}
  10748: Yet I can't faultaru your work ethic. You've performed far better than I assumed you would.${prompt}
  10749: I have to say, though, part of me was jumping-wumping at the prospect of adventuring with my friends again.${prompt}
  10750: On the other hand, I no longer understand what motivatarus adventurers.${prompt}
  10751: I'd always assumed it was to appreciataru being with one's friends, but...${prompt}
  10752: What do you think? Is there a specific reason-weason you became an adventurer?${prompt}

    What did you want to do as an adventurer?

    Explore unknown frontiers.

    Expand my intellectual horizons.
    Combat powerful entities.
    Nothing in particular.${prompt}
  10754: Well, at least you're honestaru. Straight answers can be so refreshing.${prompt}
  10755: |-
    You go “any way the wind blows,” eh?
    I envy-wenvy you. I could never bring myself to do something so radical.${prompt}
  10756: Unlike you, I...${prompt}
  10757: I simultaneously covetaru the adventurer lifestyle while withdrawing from it.${prompt}
  10758: What am I even doing...?${prompt}
  10759: Deep down, I understand that Records of Eminence, objectives, and adventuring are nothing more than impetus-wimpetuses.${prompt}
  10760: They're excuses to reach out, to make contactaru, to say, “I miss the time we spent together.”${prompt}
  10761: I just had to be stubborn-wubborn, though. If anyone here's a fool, it's definitely me.${prompt}
  10762: '...And now I''m complaining to you. Some embodimentaru of adventuring ideals I turned out to be.${prompt}'
  10763: Take this and leave me to wallow in my self-pity-wity already!${prompt}
  10764: Oh, to go adventuring again...${prompt}
  10765: |-
    Hey, I have an idea.
    Why not lightaru these fireworks from a place that has special meaning to you? A place that's overflowing with memories of the past.${prompt}
  10766: Then, could I ask you to share anything of significance-wificance you remember with those close to you?${prompt}
  10767: You don't have to...but if you do, I'd be in your debtaru.${prompt}
  10768: They say every adventurer has a reason for startaruing their journey. Sometimes I forget what mine was...${prompt}

  10770: I've been giving it some thoughtaru for a while now, and, well, I...${prompt}
  10771: I quitaru being an adventurer!${prompt}
  10772: Now because of that...I need to ask you a favor-wavor.${prompt}
  10773: You see, I got a little bit of Eternal Flame in me and kind of had A.M.A.N. make a special-wecial objective for me.${prompt}
  10774: They were nice enough to oblige me and post it publicly, for all to undertake, which I appreciataru.${prompt}
  10775: After mulling-wulling it over, though, I realized that I can't possibly completaru it alone.${prompt}
  10776: |-
    So, yeeeah... <Whistle>
    I'm going to need-weed you to do it for me.${prompt}
  10777: |-
    Wh-what'll you have to do?
    Well, uhhhm...just excommunicataru some Yagudo High Priests from Castle Oztroja, that's all.${prompt}
  10778: Someone so teensy-weensy as me couldn't even pull a feather off one of them, let alone baste a flock. You've been baptized by the Records of Eminence, though! You can defeataru almost anything that comes at you, so will you please help me?${prompt}

    Will you help her?
    ${selection-lines}
    With pleasure.
    If you give a Taru a treat...${prompt}
  10780: I guess I'll just have to ask a more competentaru adventurer, then. One who won't fly the coop when faced with a challenge.${prompt}
  10781: |-
    I just knew you would!
    Now, go out and ground a few of those high flyers in the name of progress-wogress!${prompt}
  10782: Why Yagudo High Priests?${prompt}
  10783: I have my reason-weasons...${prompt}
  10784: '...and that''s why it had to be those theocratic thugs. I was sick of that sour-wour taste in my mouth.${prompt}'

    I feel for you.
    So you took it out on me?${prompt}
  10786: I can't begin to describe how elatarued you've just made me. Thank you.${prompt}
  10787: So what if I did? You got a problem-woblem with that?${prompt}
  10788: 'Anyway, I''ve discovered that in the end, adventaruing comes down to three things: strength of mind, strength of body, and the strength of fortune.${prompt}'

  10790: '...but still, I can''t help but feel slightarued.${prompt}'
  10791: That's my honestaru opinion.${prompt}
  10792: I won't ask for your empathy-wempathy or to have the scales fall from your eyes, I just want you to comply with my dumb requestaru.${prompt}
  10793: '...Not at the expense of your own life, though. I wouldn''t want to have that on my conscience-wonscience. Take as many companions as you can gather and don''t do anything I wouldn''t...wait, then you wouldn''t even undertake this objective.${prompt}'
  10794: If the “Grudge” objective I gave you seems too difficultaru or dangerous, feel free to leave it for later-water.${prompt}
  10795: You must be the envy of pugilistarus the world over.${prompt}
  10796: To think that I was worried about you not coming back alive due to my exorbitantaru demands...${prompt}
  10797: |-
    How silly-willy of me.
    I should have known that it would take more than a flock of zealous friars to kill you.${prompt}
  10798: Especially with the aura of confidence you exertaru, I can never count you out of any fight.${prompt}
  10799: Well, now that you've cleared the emotional cloud-wouds that hung over my heart, I can quit in peace. Too bad I'll have to look for a new place to stay, since I can't use my Mog House any more.${prompt}
  10800: But before I go, take this as thanks for all you've done-wone.${prompt}
  10801: Toto! Toto! We're not in Xarcabard anymore!${prompt}
  10802: Wh-what are you all doing-woing here?${prompt}
  10803: There is something we simply could not wait to share with you, Nantoto.${prompt}
  10804: While I am willing to share my love with anyone at any time, this gift is more...substantial than that.${prompt}
  10805: I wanted to give you one of my teacherly hugs for motivation, but we decided on pouring our blood, sweat, and tears into getting you this instead. Enjoy!${prompt}
  10806: Why, this is...${prompt}
  10807: Go on and unrrravel it like a ball of yarn!${prompt}
  10808: But...why would you do this for a desertaru like me?${prompt}
  10809: No matter what you choose to do with your life henceforth, I have a feeling that you will end up using that to help us one way or another.${prompt}
  10810: Though my heart may swell with fraternal affection for all, it heals no one. Only you can cure the wounds of the masses. That scroll is best in your hands.${prompt}
  10811: I...I don't know what to say that won't sound tritaru...${prompt}
  10812: '${color-alt: 141}Nantoto uses ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.'
  10813: Nantoto learns a new spell!
  10814: I'm such a fool. I thought you'd given up on me, so I started actaruing like a meanie-weanie to you.${prompt}
  10815: In reality, though, <sniffle> you've had me in your heartarus all along... Waaah!${prompt}
  10816: Sorry, Toto. We would've said something to help brace you, but didn't want to spoil the element of surprrrise!${prompt}
  10817: I have to say that I expected our gift to bring a smile to your face, not tears to your eyes.${prompt}
  10818: It's just that...I believed you were avoiding me...so...${prompt}
  10819: I desperately wanted to tell you in advance, but Fhelm was dead set against it!${prompt}
  10820: I had no choice! You'd rrraise the fur on your back and hiss at us if we mentioned anything about a present.${prompt}
  10821: I...I'm touch-wouched. To think that I ever wanted to throw away my life as an adventurer...${prompt}
  10822: I've said so many terrible-werrible things, but...if you'd find it within yourselves to take me back...
  10823: Of course we do! Our bonds of friendship run deeper than the Sea of Shu'Meyo!${prompt}
  10824: The next time you're at a loss for an answer, remember to look to our collective love nestled deep inside you. It'll warm your soul like no other!${prompt}
  10825: I can't thank you...<sniffle>...enough...${prompt}
  10826: You will always have a spot behind my back, Nantoto, ever since you saved me from certain death.${prompt}
  10827: I still have the image of that day freshly imprintarued on my mind. We were fighting some harebrained warriors in the Valkurm Dunes--${prompt}
  10828: Could you please use a more flattering word like “audacious” or “venturous”? Otherwise, it makes me sound doubly pathetic for almost dying at their hands.${prompt}
  10829: You managed to pry me from death's icy grip, but we still had to flee in order to fight another day.${prompt}
  10830: And I met you on the hunt, rrright? Oh, how we used to fight like cats from dusk to dawn.${prompt}
  10831: |-
    Hahaha, we sure did.
    I remember having the most heated of argumentarus with you, then crying to Isakoth and Ervok afterwards.${prompt}
  10832: Assiduity and opportunity are one's most powerful assets on the path to enlightenment. The knowledge you gain from your travels across continents will be key to unlocking the gates to uncharted territories.${prompt}
  10833: Exploration is the testimony to one's courage. Likewise, Records of Eminence objectives are testimony to mankind's inquisitiveness.${prompt}
  10834: Myriad thoughts, feelings, and recollections are scattered over this vast land. We thus calmly gather them into our arms and release them anew unto the adventuring masses. We pay the price for our meddling, but so too do we reap the rewards. We dare, therefore we are.${prompt}
  10835: I could not have said it better myself!${prompt}
  10836: The influence each of you exerts during your eminent activities may be small in and of itself.${prompt}
  10837: However, those to whom you provide succor deeply appreciate your tireless efforts.${prompt}
  10838: Moreover, you do not provide aid exclusively to single individuals. Entire organizations also place their trust in you.${prompt}
  10839: Many within the A.M.A.N. possess financial resources the average commoner could only dream of. A chance opportunity from one of these individuals could yield untold riches.${prompt}
  10840: It is therefore no stretch of the imagination to say that we are able to subsist due to the noble work ethic of adventurers like you.${prompt}
  10841: In other words...scratch A.M.A.N.'s back, and it will scratch yours.${prompt}
  10842: I could not have said it better myself!${prompt}
  10843: For example, you have also made a pilgrimage to various telepoints scattered about the four corners of Vana'diel and dispersed the darkness that enshrouded the Eldieme Necropolis.${prompt}
  10844: These two objectives were both originally issued by a certain member of the San d'Orian elite.${prompt}
  10845: In contrast, the one Nantoto requested regarding an ouka ranman cannot be described as anything but an abnormality.${prompt}
  10846: 'That was one which I had to work behind the scenes to enact. If my memory serves me, you chose ${zone: 0[2]} as the spot in which to unleash your explosion of memories, correct?${prompt}'
  10847: Heh, fear not, for only you and I know that you consider that place a sanctuary. I will not tell a soul.${prompt}
  10848: Nor will I tell anyone about the valor you displayed in defeating the Yagudo High Priests to complete “Grudge.”${prompt}
  10849: '...However, I suppose Nantoto already knows that.${prompt}'
  10850: ${name-player}!${prompt}
  10851: I can't adequataruly express how much I owe you for taking out those Yagudo!${prompt}
  10852: 'Listen, we''ve all decided-wided to go to ${zone: 0[2]}...${prompt}'
  10853: We want to check on some reportarus concerning a humongous dragon that supposedly patrols the skies there.${prompt}
  10854: We've heard various rumors about a specific locale there where bounding insectarus gather. Hopefully we'll be able to find it.${prompt}
  10855: There's a mountain of hearsay about a flower there that floatarus in midair. I certainly want to see if it's actually real or not.${prompt}
  10856: There you are! I've been looking-wooking all over for you.${prompt}
  10857: I received a couple lettarus addressed to you.${prompt}
  10858: They all come in...uniquely colored envelope-wenvelopes and are signed “D.” What do you want to do with them?${prompt}
  10859: |-
    Open which one?

  10860: I wouldn't open any if I were you, either. You never know what crazy-wazy stuff people deliver these days. I'd feel bad about throwing another person's property away, though, so I'll hold onto them for safekeeping.${prompt}
  10861: Here you go. I hope it doesn't contain anything too suspectaru.${prompt}
  10862: The envelope contains a briefing for a new objective.${prompt}

    Ya just never know wit' a myst'ry box.${prompt}
  10869: |-
    Also, I calls da amount o' time ya's waited yer circa...circama...circamadamian...ugh, yer “daily tally.”
    It ain't just da name dat's catchy, though. Da higher yer tally, da gooder yer goods get! Can't get much good--er, simpler dan dat.${prompt}

    Finally, ya opens da chest.
    Oooh, I can barely contain m'self thinkin' o' all da riches I--er, ya could have!${prompt}

    Oh, dat's right!

    Mebbe not by much, but dat's better'n nothin', am I right?${prompt}
  10872: |-
    And dere's no better feelin' dan takin' trash and turnin' it into treasure. It's pramactically a new kind o' alchemy!

    Lastly, since we don't knows where da items go once inside, ya ain't gettin' nothin' back datcha put in.

  10982: I wonder how you go about learning to summon-wummon a morbol... I suppose I'd need to become a Beastmaster first?${prompt}
  10983: This remarkable cafe was created as part of the Green Festival event, which was an effort to help revitalize Jeuno.${prompt}
  10984: Originally concentrated in the southern countries, it has finally made its way here after moving from place to place for many years.${prompt}
  10985: However, never in my wildest dreams did I think that people would want to cuddle with morbols... What's this world coming to!?${prompt}

  10994: Greetings. Care to look over my quality wares straight from Bastok? You won't find a better selection anywhere.
  10995: Welcome! I've gathered some of the finestaru goods from across the frontier for your perusal!
  10996: Hm? Forgive me, but you'll need to come back when you have a little more experience as an adventurer and a deeper understanding of the Records of Eminence.${prompt}
  10997: Hello, it is a pleasure to meet you. I have a feeling you're just the person I've been looking for.${prompt}
  10998: '${color-alt: 15}Greyson stares at you intently.'
  10999: Ah, my apologies. Please allow me to explain. I used to be an adventurer myself and can therefore discern your strength with a mere glance.${prompt}
  11000: By chance, have you ever heard of the A.M.A.N. Reclaimers?${prompt}
  11001: They're a group that goes around collecting various items and equipment.${prompt}
  11002: They take equipment donated to the A.M.A.N. by retired adventurers and refurbish it before passing it along to active adventurers in need.${prompt}
  11003: And yours truly is in charge of coordinating the collection of those items!${prompt}
  11004: Well, I guess you could say I'm more of an employee doing the A.M.A.N.'s bidding. Hahaha...${prompt}
  11005: 'So, if you bring me some ${item-plural: 0[2]}, I''ll exchange them for various goods.${prompt}'
  11006: 'You can obtain ${item-plural: 0[2]} by completing these Records of Eminence objectives.${prompt}'
  11007: I have a feeling an adventurer of your caliber is more than up to the task. I wish you luck, friend!${prompt}
  11008: 'Stop by anytime and I''ll take any ${item-plural: 0[2]} that you manage to collect.${prompt}'
  11009: When you have saved up enough, you can exchange them for special orbs that contain monsters as well as the aforementioned refurbished goods.${prompt}
  11010: Hahaha! I know what you're thinking... Monsters? Inside of an orb?${prompt}
  11011: From what I hear, the A.M.A.N. recreated the technology behind the orbs that are exchanged for beastmen seals and repurposed it for this occasion.${prompt}
  11012: I guess the monsters are kind of a package deal along with the items! Hahaha!${prompt}
  11013: Although, I suppose you could say it makes the whole process that much more interesting.${prompt}
  11014: At any rate, I'm sure a hearty adventurer like yourself relishes such challenges!${prompt}
  11015: You simply need to take the orbs you obtain here and throw them into the burning circles in Yughott Grotto, the Palborough Mines, and Giddeus in order to remove the seals and cause the orbs' contents to spring forth.${prompt}
  11016: Oh, I should probably mention one more thing. The method for obtaining the contents of the chests is somewhat...unique.${prompt}
  11017: First, a total of one metal chest and ten wooden chests will emerge from the orb, although one of the wooden chests is actually a mimic. That is the monster I was referring to previously.${prompt}
  11018: You will receive the items once you open the metal chest. However, the more wooden chests you open before the metal one, the more items you'll receive!${prompt}
  11019: In other words, the more wooden chests you're able to open while avoiding the mimic, the more goodies you'll get after opening the metal chest!${prompt}
  11020: Obviously, you won't know whether a particular wooden chest is the mimic or not until you open it, so in the end, it pretty much comes down to sheer luck.${prompt}
  11021: '${color-alt: 15}Greyson smiles at you gently.'
  11022: Now then, if you'd like to know more about the orbs or anything else, feel free to ask away.${prompt}
  11023: I'm also more than happy to explain to you the intricacies of rainbow chests, belligerent bangs, and previously used orbs.${prompt}

  11031: Um... I'm sorry, but you don't have enough money.${prompt}
  11032: I'm sorry, but in order to prevent people from hoarding all of the items, there's a limit on how many vouchers can be purchased within a certain time period. You'll need to wait about one month (Earth time) before buying more.${prompt}

  11037: 'So, you want to know about the difference between ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}...${prompt}'
  11038: 'Basically, the difference comes down to the success rate of obtaining better-quality items. It''s much easier to hit it big and win higher-quality items with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  11039: 'Furthermore, the ${item-singular: 1[2]} ensures that at least one of your items will be of a certain quality.${prompt}'
  11040: Although, I imagine the definition of “quality” differs from person to person, so just think of it as a general guide.${prompt}
  11041: On a separate note, I heard a rumor when I first started that the more you bring to the A.M.A.N., the more items you'll receive.${prompt}
  11042: 'You can obtain ${item-plural: 0[2]} by completing the Records of Eminence objectives I gave you earlier.${prompt}'
  11043: 'And you can always buy them from me, too. However, there is a limit of ${number: 8} vouchers per month (Earth time) in order to prevent people from hoarding all of the items for themselves.${prompt}'
  11044: Among the wooden coffers you come across, a small fraction of them will be shimmering with a prismatic light.${prompt}
  11045: These “rainbow chests“ are sometimes present right from the outset, and they always contain a highly-sought-after reward inside.${prompt}
  11046: Some who have ventured into the trove have reported that if they open eight wooden chests--meaning that the only one left contains a mimic--the remaining chest will be overcome with the selfsame rainbow glow.${prompt}
  11047: Of course, I cannot even begin to fathom how lucky one would have to be for that to actually be the case. Perhaps it's but a rumor.${prompt}
  11048: Ah, yes. The good old belligerent bangs.${prompt}
  11049: The sound that the treasure chest makes when you eagerly open it, flinging the lid open and slamming it onto the back of the chest, has some correlation with whether or not the chest's reward is great, or merely “good.”${prompt}
  11050: Particularly astute adventurers will also note that opening a chest can provide a clue as to whether or not any of the remaining chests have particularly valuable rewards.${prompt}
  11051: However, it takes a few treasure chests to be able to properly triangulate your internal sensing systems. Opening three should be sufficient.${prompt}
  11052: If I could meet whomever or whatever was in charge of crafting these orbs, I would be inclined to give them a good smacking.${prompt}
  11053: But let's keep that between us, hm?${prompt}
  11054: Would you happen to be in possession of any used A.M.A.N. Trove orbs?${prompt}
  11055: The A.M.A.N. believes that littering the ground with used trinkets harms the beauty of the landscape, so we are happy to provide you with proper compensation should you trade me used orbs instead of discarding them.${prompt}
  11056: Who knows? If I'm feeling particularly generous that day, you may get a fresh orb for your troubles.${prompt}
  11057: Hm? You wish to know more about me personally? Well, I used to be an adventurer myself, you see.${prompt}
  11058: I might not look the part, but I fought on the front lines in many strange lands, earning merit points as a warrior, ninja, and various other jobs.${prompt}
  11059: However, I made an important discovery about myself while leading that life.${prompt}
  11060: I found that being forced to do things a certain way all in the name of efficiency kind of defeated the whole purpose of being an adventurer.${prompt}
  11061: I felt that even though it might not always be the best way, it was important to be versatile when it came to party formations, fighting styles, and the like.${prompt}
  11062: When I thought about it like that, I decided to retire and become a merchant in order to help like-minded adventurers in their journeys.${prompt}
  11063: To that end, I purchased items that people no longer needed and looked to sell them in places where they were wanted...${prompt}
  11064: However, I had trouble making ends meet and, as you can see from the looks of me, ended up quite poor. So, with nothing but the clothes on my back, I trudged on until I was introduced to this job by a contact from my adventurer days.${prompt}
  11065: Now, I'm able to at least put food on the table while still realizing my dream of helping other adventurers, so it was all worth it.${prompt}
  11066: 'Of course, I''m happy if I can turn a small profit along the way too, so I''d appreciate it if you could buy some ${item-plural: 0[2]} from me as well!${prompt}'

  11073: |-
    Ah, I know the girl yer talkin' about!
    The one who's here for the Festival of Brave Souls!${prompt}
  11074: |-
    The festival's a very important event for us Goblins.
    It's been around fer ages now.${prompt}
  11075: It's held whenever we Goblins are in danger or the world itself has lost all hope...${prompt}
  11076: The festival helps bring us a sense of calm when we feel like prayin' is our only remainin' option.${prompt}
  11077: |-
    The last time it was held was over several hundred years ago...
    They say there was a battle 'tween the gods of light and darkness.${prompt}
  11078: |-
    Of course, the reason we're holdin' it again now goes without sayin'.
    Countless “World Eater Eggs” are being found across the land.${prompt}
  11079: Yes, I've heard all about you as well.${prompt}
  11080: Ya saved our Goblin heroes from certain death on Zepwell Island, yes?${prompt}
  11081: Even though you're no beastie, ya know just how terrifyin' a “World Eater Egg” from Chaos truly is.${prompt}
  11082: Therefore, you can understand the fear, anxiety, and general unease that we Goblins are feelin', right?${prompt}
  11083: |-
    In fact, it terrifies us beasties so much that many aren't even able to work.
    That's why we need to have this festival--to calm everyone's nerves.${prompt}
  11084: Hm? You wanna know how this girl yer lookin' for's involved with the festival?${prompt}
  11085: |-
    The Festival of Brave Souls is always a sad affair, so I thought it'd be good to prepare somethin' a bit more lighthearted.
    Ya know, to keep up wit' the times and all.${prompt}
  11086: So I put out a call for a skilled entertainer and that girl showed up.${prompt}
  11087: However, she was much weaker than I expected...${prompt}
  11088: So I sent her over to Maat in order to really push her to her limits and get her ready in time fer the festival.${prompt}
  11089: |-
    Huh? She forgot somethin' while she was there?
    And now you're tryin' to give it back to her?${prompt}
  11090: |-
    I see...
    In that case, I suppose it's okay if I tell you her whereabouts...${prompt}
  11091: |-
    According to her, she's always bein' hounded by her many throngs of fans.
    So she asked that I keep her location a secret.${prompt}
  11092: |-
    Although, we've had to shelve our plans to have her perform at the festival.
    I doubt there'll be much to see, let alone any of her fans.${prompt}
  11093: |-
    Here, I'll draw up a map for ya.
    Simply show it to the Tarutaru soldier in front of the Rent-a-Room in Lower Jeuno.${prompt}
  11094: |-
    His name is Miladi-Nildi.
    He can show you where she's stayin'.${prompt}
  11095: |-
    As long as that shadow looms large, we can't have the festival.
    Is there anything that can be done...${prompt}
  11096: |-
    Show that map I drew ya to the soldier standin' in front of the Rent-a-Room in Lower Jeuno.
    His name is Miladi-Nildi.${prompt}

  11102: Wh-where did you find this!?${prompt}
  11103: So ${name-player}, you heard everything, did you...${prompt}
  11104: I was hoping to seek out new challenges and take my idol career to the next level.${prompt}
  11105: You see, I wanted to form a dance duo with a Goblin girl so that we could display our talents on a worldwide stage.${prompt}
  11106: Uka felt that the image of the Mighty Maidens would suffer as a result, but I'm more worried about my act growing stale.${prompt}
  11107: I mean, I know I'm wildly popular with my fans and audiences everywhere, but I'm constantly doing the same show over and over again!${prompt}
  11108: |-
    They're waiting with bated breath for me to come out with a great new costume and even more songs and dance routines!
    You know, something real spectacular!${prompt}
  11109: It was then that things took a sudden turn...${prompt}
  11110: I heard the Goblins were planning some kind of festival.${prompt}
  11111: |-
    When you think of festivals, what comes to mind? That's right! The performances!
    And what better performance is there than the Heroine Stage Show?${prompt}
  11112: |-
    Somehow, the Goblins felt that my show lacked the proper punch.
    However, I know my fans would've given me the strength to put on a powerful performance.${prompt}
  11113: |-
    So I started thinking up some new poses and catchphrases.
    I worked really hard on them too...${prompt}
  11114: |-
    Even so, that Maat guy kept complaining about me though.
    He basically told me I was a failure as an idol!${prompt}
  11115: It caused me to lose some of my usual superstar swagger.${prompt}
  11116: Hah! C-could this be the work of the evil Ullegore!?${prompt}
  11117: |-
    ...
    No, it can't be. I didn't even hear any narration.${prompt}
  11118: Ah, there you are, Mumor. I come bearing news.${prompt}
  11119: Huh!?
  11120: |-
    This isn't good!
    This isn't good at all, kupo!${prompt}
  11121: What's wrong, Diva...err, I mean Kupolietta!?${prompt}
  11122: I was told that we might not be able to perform at the Festival of Brave Souls, kupo!${prompt}
  11123: |-
    Wait, what!?
    Why not!?${prompt}
  11124: |-
    It's all because of that rumor...
    That terrible rumor, kupo.${prompt}
  11125: They say an ominous shadow wanders to the east of Batallia Downs each and every night...
  11126: Apparently, everyone who sees it says the same thing, kupo...
  11127: “I saw something that nobody should ever have to see...”
  11128: They then leave Jeuno, never to return again...
  11129: |-
    Th-this is terrible news!
    Isn't the Festival of Brave Souls also held east of Batallia Downs!?${prompt}
  11130: |-
    Indeed it is, kupo.
    The cave there is the very heart of the festivities.${prompt}
  11131: Yet, as long as that shadow roams about, there's no way they can have the festival, kupo.${prompt}
  11132: Hah! C-could this be the work of the evil Ullegore!?${prompt}
  11133: |-
    ...
    No, it can't be. I didn't even hear any narration.${prompt}
  11134: And so, the brave Mumor found that she must rise up to strike down this shadowy threat!${prompt}
  11135: |-
    Yes, that's right!
    I must take my destiny into my own hands!${prompt}
  11136: |-
    Although, as it stands, I'm just a lone idol.
    I'll never be able to muster the necessary strength for this task.${prompt}
  11137: |-
    So that's where you come in.
    This is your chance to join me as a Mighty Maiden!${prompt}
  11138: |-
    I mean, you're an adventurer, right?
    Come on, together, we'll form an unstoppable duo!${prompt}
  11139: |-
    Form a duo with Mumor?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure, why not.
    I think I'll pass.
    I'm not really a maiden...${prompt}
  11140: |-
    Thank you so much!
    It's settled then! We'll be known as the Dashing Damsels!${prompt}
  11141: |-
    What's that?
    Speak up, I can't hear you.${prompt}
  11142: |-
    Hooray!
    We're going to be the best duo ever!${prompt}
  11143: Come on--deep down, everyone has something of a girlish side.${prompt}
  11144: From today forth, we shall be known as the Delightful Damsels!${prompt}
  11145: There's nothing like the sweet feelings of love that come from a warm and caring heart.${prompt}
  11146: |-
    We'll show that sinister shadow what for!
    Come, we march for Batallia Downs at once!${prompt}
  11147: Hm? You're wondering if I know aboutaru the mysterious shadow that wanders Batallia Downs after dark?${prompt}
  11148: |-
    Of course I do!
    You'd be smartaru to stay away from the cave in eastern Batallia Downs--the one within view of the ocean.${prompt}
  11149: But, if you think you have what it takes to stand againstaru this shadow, I won't try to stop you.${prompt}
  11150: Are ya here 'bout the Festival of Brave Souls too?${prompt}
  11151: |-
    Oh well, I guess it can't be helped.
    The most important site for the festival is a cave east of Batallia Downs.${prompt}
  11152: |-
    Five thousand years ago, many brave warriors lost their lives.
    That location is currently servin' as their burial mound.${prompt}
  11153: |-
    But there's a mysterious shadow prowlin' their eternal resting place.
    Unfortunately, it's keepin' us from going anywhere near it.${prompt}
  11154: |-
    Unbelievable!
    Why am I just hearing about this now!?${prompt}
  11155: I understand your frustration, but this story was written for us by a famous Goblin author.${prompt}
  11156: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}!
    I'm glad you're here!${prompt}
  11157: You know my show that was scheduled for the Festival of Brave Souls?${prompt}
  11158: Get this, they're calling it the “Mighty Maiden Fantastox Heroine Stage Show”!${prompt}
  11159: |-
    First of all, who is this Fantastox person!?
    My name is Mumor!${prompt}
  11160: |-
    Fantastox's a famous Goblin thief.
    Her specialties include Sneak Attacks and Trick Attacks.${prompt}
  11161: So I'm supposed to team up with this thief against the enemy, right!?${prompt}
  11162: Actually, we need ya to play the evil villain that's tryin' to steal Mighty Maiden Fantastox's mask.${prompt}
  11163: |-
    Why would I want to steal some girl's mask?
    That's a bit weird, don't you think?${prompt}
  11164: In the story, it's a special mask that's got the power to turn boulders into bombs.${prompt}
  11165: |-
    And what am I supposed to do with something like that!?
    Although, I guess a show is always better if it has explosions in it...${prompt}
  11166: |-
    I know, right?
    We're gonna use smoke to simulate the explosion and set the stage.${prompt}
  11167: |-
    I get it!
    So that's when I appear as Mighty Maiden Mumor and sing my new song!?${prompt}
  11168: |-
    Exactly! Due to your actions, the world finds itself on the brink of destruction...
    But that's when Fantastox rises up to resume the fight!${prompt}
  11169: |-
    Wait, what!?
    You're totally making me out to be the villain here!${prompt}
  11170: |-
    Yeah, that's the point.
    I've been tellin' ya that from the very beginning.${prompt}
  11171: |-
    Hey, it's ${name-player}!
    What are you doing here!?${prompt}
  11172: Ah! It's the brave hero, Gloom Phantom!${prompt}
  11173: Brave hero...?${prompt}
  11174: I came as soon as I received your message!${prompt}
  11175: So the “World Eater Egg” was found right in the middle of Jeuno!${prompt}
  11176: |-
    That's right.
    Before anyone realized it was the “World Eater Egg,” it went from being in a Goblin's capable hands to someone eating it...${prompt}
  11177: Wha!? The shell was cracked open without needing my sword!?${prompt}
  11178: |-
    Yeah, it's a total mystery.
    It's also unclear where this “World Eater Egg” originally came from.${prompt}
  11179: The World Eater...Egg...?${prompt}
  11180: Ultimately, it was that girl there who gave the egg to the man known as Maat, who then promptly ate it.${prompt}
  11181: |-
    W-well, I, uh...
    He told me he was hungry, and so I simply brought him ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} I found nearby...${prompt}
  11182: What I want to know is where was the egg before that?${prompt}
  11183: I don't know the details, but I heard a monster near Delkfutt's Tower was carryin' it.${prompt}
  11184: |-
    Delkfutt?
    Where have I heard that name before...${prompt}
  11185: |-
    Delkfutt's Tower is on Qufim Island, which is in Gigas territory.
    Clearly, certain death awaits us there.${prompt}
  11186: Can I ask for your help in this matter, brave hero?${prompt}
  11187: |-
    That's why I'm here!
    Leave everything to us!${prompt}
  11188: Hmm... Maybe one of the Gigas knows about the egg and the monster that had it...${prompt}
  11189: |-
    I got it!
    We'll go to Qufim Island and capture one of the Gigas there and question it!${prompt}
  11190: You can help us too, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  11191: |-
    Will you help?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure, count me in!
    Sorry, I'm busy.${prompt}
  11192: Naturally, Dazbog and Magh Bihu'll be going to Qufim Island as well!${prompt}
  11193: Where's your sense of adventure!?${prompt}
  11194: Dazbog and Magh Bihu'll be going to Qufim Island too, so there's no need to be afraid!${prompt}
  11195: Okay, we'll be waiting for you in front of Delkfutt's Tower!${prompt}
  11196: |-
    It's rare that you meet such a mighty hero in person.
    There aren't many who can draw others to their cause so effortlessly.${prompt}
  11197: |-
    As for you...
    I believe people called ya "that horror from the holdfast" before, yes?${prompt}
  11198: So clearly, that makes ya the perfect villain for our story.${prompt}
  11199: |-
    I resent that remark!
    You obviously don't know what's important in a Heroine Stage Show!${prompt}
  11200: Wh-what did you say!?${prompt}
  11201: If you don't know how a show is supposed to resonate with its fans, then I guess I'll just have to teach you!${prompt}
  11202: Phew! That was intense.${prompt}
  11203: She said she's goin' back home to grab an old script or somethin' like that.${prompt}
  11204: I think I'd better take this chance to get as far away from here as possible...${prompt}
  11205: |-
    As for you, you need to go help Gloom Phantom at Delkfutt's Tower on Qufim Island.
    Got it?${prompt}
  11206: So anyway, that Gigas known as Echion knew some things, but not others.${prompt}
  11207: |-
    I see...
    Although, we still don't know how the “World Eater Egg” was cracked open without using your sword.${prompt}
  11208: Indeed. Not even the undead themselves should be able to break it open.${prompt}
  11209: However, they do seem to have the ability to find the “World Eater Egg.”${prompt}
  11210: |-
    Still, I'm amazed by the Gigas's stupidity.
    This all happened because they found the “World Eater Egg” and just let it be.${prompt}
  11211: They just ignore whatever we have to say!${prompt}
  11212: Furthermore, they have no idea just how terrifying Chaos truly is!${prompt}
  11213: Five thousand years ago, the one known as Chaos sought to destroy all that was new, even the world itself...${prompt}
  11214: |-
    That included Goblins, Yagudo, Orcs, Quadav...
    Anything that was different from itself.
  11215: A great number of species went extinct before the strongest of those that remained banded together.
  11216: The Gigas feel that way because during the battle against Chaos five thousand years ago, they hadn't even been born yet.${prompt}
  11217: So there's no way they could've known about the hatred from those that were devoured by Chaos.${prompt}
  11218: Well, I don't like how they don't believe us just because they haven't seen something themselves.${prompt}
  11219: By the way, about that undead who was carrying the World Eater Egg...${prompt}
  11220: Is the mage known as Garazu-Horeizu that can control the undead involved somehow?${prompt}
  11221: Actually, we don't really know the answer to that ourselves.${prompt}
  11222: Well, someone must know something!${prompt}
  11223: M-maybe this one here knows s-something?${prompt}
  11224: |-
    How about Garazu-Horeizu and Chaos?
    ${selection-lines}
    The book on maelstrom theory...?
    The Fourth Yagudo War...?
    Sorry, I forgot.${prompt}
  11225: |-
    What do you mean you forgot!?
    I'm gonna yank your petals out myself!${prompt}
  11226: |-
    How about Garazu-Horeizu and Chaos?
    ${selection-lines}
    Like the maelstrom theory?
    How about the Yagudo War?
    Was it the “new discoveries”?${prompt}
  11227: Hmm... I'm not sure if that makes it any clearer or not.${prompt}
  11228: |-
    I think I got a pretty good idea.
    We can have Dazbog explain the rest later.${prompt}
  11229: Th-that's fine, but we still haven't solved the m-mystery yet...${prompt}
  11230: We haven't!?${prompt}
  11231: C-clearly, Garazu-Horeizu wanted info on Chaos in order to l-learn a new kind of magic.${prompt}
  11232: H-he looked into Chaos even after his death and journey to V-Valhalla...${prompt}
  11233: B-but Chaos was defeated in Valhalla...${prompt}
  11234: |-
    Yeah, that's right!
    Odin dealt the finishing blow personally!${prompt}
  11235: Wait, I thought it was a brave Goblin hero that delivered that blow five thousand years ago?${prompt}
  11236: Huh? In the battle for the Middle Lands, it was my ancestor who dealt the finishing blow.${prompt}
  11237: However, Chaos was no ordinary opponent.${prompt}
  11238: Chaos was resurrected in a world beyond this one...${prompt}
  11239: So my ancestor and numerous other brave warriors journeyed to Valhalla and continued the fight, even beyond death.${prompt}
  11240: Ah, so those are the warriors whose death we mourn as part of the Festival of Brave Souls.${prompt}
  11241: So at the very end, Odin dealt the final blow.${prompt}
  11242: Hmm... So clearly, Chaos met its end long, long ago.${prompt}
  11243: |-
    That's a relief.
    I was worried about what I'd do if Chaos was still alive today.${prompt}
  11244: |-
    It's not just me, either. All Goblins carry this sense of dread.
    That's why we started the Festival of Brave Souls.${prompt}
  11245: I wholeheartedly support this festival as well!${prompt}
  11246: |-
    I've got it!
    We can call it the “Mighty Maidens Heroine Stage Show: Remember the Battle against Chaos”!${prompt}
  11247: Say that again?${prompt}
  11248: It's a show we can put on at the Festival of Brave Souls!${prompt}
  11249: 'Or, we can simplify the name a bit and just call it the “Mighty Maidens Heroine Stage Show: Defeat Chaos”!${prompt}'
  11250: What is she talking about!?${prompt}
  11251: She's not happy with the show for the festival, so she's been trying to convince me to change it.${prompt}
  11252: |-
    You're right...
    She's been here the whole time.${prompt}
  11253: It came to me after hearing all of you talk!${prompt}
  11254: This evil being known as Chaos tried to eradicate anyone who was different from it, so various beings worked together to oppose it, right?${prompt}
  11255: |-
    And afterwards, this enemy rose up once again to put the land in danger!
    This story has it all--a real tearjerker followed by everyone living happily ever after!${prompt}
  11256: A story like that contains everything that fans want to see in a Heroine Stage Show!${prompt}
  11257: 'First: everyone is made stronger due to their differences!${prompt}'
  11258: 'Second: they overcome their differences and work together!${prompt}'
  11259: 'Third: there are moments of sadness, but people rise up in a spirit of hope!${prompt}'
  11260: Hmm... When you put it like that...${prompt}
  11261: Furthermore, once everyone sees the show, they won't be like the Gigas and not believe in something because they've never seen it before!${prompt}
  11262: Yes, I suppose you have a point...${prompt}
  11263: Okay! I'll give it some thought!${prompt}
  11264: You will!?${prompt}
  11265: However, in regards to Valhalla...${prompt}
  11266: Chaos may have hidden the egg before its death.${prompt}
  11267: |-
    Yes, that's totally possible!
    However, I think Odin would've noticed...${prompt}
  11268: Maybe his nose was stuffed up, or he had something else on his mind at the time.${prompt}
  11269: |-
    I-it's definitely a mystery...
    I wish I could ask Odin p-personally.${prompt}
  11270: Wha!? You realize that means you'd have to be dead, right!?${prompt}
  11271: Of course I don't want to die, but I don't want to go back to Hazhalm either!${prompt}
  11272: I-in that case, we could always ask one of Odin's demons...${prompt}
  11273: Oh! You're right! That's a great idea!${prompt}
  11274: Is there one that we can easily talk to?${prompt}
  11275: |-
    There are a few like that here in Jeuno.
    They're disguised as regular people.${prompt}
  11276: Okay then! Let's get going!${prompt}
  11277: After hearing that girl's excitement, I've decided to give her proposal some serious thought.${prompt}
  11278: With a show based on the battle against Chaos, we can reach people that might not know anything about it.${prompt}
  11279: |-
    The problem is what role can I have her play...
    Hmm... What if she played Chaos...?${prompt}
