  10882: |-
    What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo!
    Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!${prompt}
  10883: |-
    We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers.
    But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!${prompt}
  10884: |-
    There! I've whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me.
    Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!${prompt}
  10885: |-
    Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo.
    Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom.
    It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!${prompt}
  10886: The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!${prompt}
  10887: |-
    In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign.
    Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.${prompt}
  10888: Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...${prompt}
  10889: |-
    King Kupofried was greatly dismayed.
    How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?${prompt}
  10890: In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.${prompt}
  10891: “Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo,” he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.${prompt}
  10892: |-
    Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin.
    A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?${prompt}
  10893: |-
    We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition.
    We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!${prompt}

    Hi there! I'm ${related-entity}, your friendly neighborhood smile sergeant!
    I'm in charge of running the ${choice: 0}[beginner/intermediate/advanced] level Smilebringer Boot Camp in this area.${prompt}
  10944: |-
    I'd be thrilled to answer any questions you might have...and of course, sign you up, too!
    You'd like that, wouldn't you? Hmmm?${prompt}
  10945: |-
    What will you do?
    ${selection-lines}
    Undertake training.
    Hear an explanation.

    What's the fastest time?

  10946: 'Fantastic! But, oh...it seems you don''t have ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}. Well, that''s just too bad!'
  10947: |-
    It'd be my pleasure! Here goes nothing! Ahem!
    The Smilebringer Boot Camp was established for two purposes, the first being the ongoing training and conditioning of smilebringers. The second--and this is where you come in, yay!--is for us to scout hopefuls from the adventurer community to join our jovial ranks!${prompt}
  10948: The population of vicious monsters has grown in recent years, you see. And because of this, more smilebringers were being--<gasp!>--injured in the line of duty than ever before.${prompt}
  10949: |-
    But we weren't going to take that sitting down, no siree.
    The day we smilebringers stop doing our job--that is, bringing smiles--is the day the world ends!${prompt}
  10950: Whatever the predicament, and no matter the size of the ruszor-inflicted gash wound, we will--we must--pull through...for the sake of the children!${prompt}
  10951: |-
    With these heart-warming ideals in mind, the Smilebringer Boot Camp was established. Ta-da!
    Smilebringers graduating from this camp are better equipped to meet the ever-changing needs of these unstable times we live in.${prompt}
  10952: |-
    The rules are as simple as sunshine. Smilebringer's honor!
    When I give you the word, run to each of the checkpoints we've set up in the area. “Smile helpers” are posted at each, so you can't miss them!${prompt}
  10953: |-
    Talk to the smile helpers and they'll confirm your passage.
    The route you take is completely up to you--just be sure you don't miss any checkpoints. You got all that? Hmmm?${prompt}
  10954: I'll mark each smile helper's location on your map beforehand, so you don't need to worry about getting lost.${prompt}

    Oh, wipe that grin off your face! I knew you wouldn't believe me!${prompt}

    Aaanyway! What I meant to say is, “work hard, play hard” is our motto, and it applies to boot camp participants, too.

  11118: The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called “Voidwalkers.” Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt}
  11119: |-
    Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.
    This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt}
  11120: Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt}
  11121: A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt}
  11122: Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt}
  11123: |-
    Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.
    Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt}
  11124: Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt}
  11125: Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt}
  11126: However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt}
  11127: |-
    When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.
    These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt}
  11128: Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt}
  11129: The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt}
  11130: |-
    Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.
    Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt}
  11131: As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt}
  11132: Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt}
  11133: Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt}
  11134: After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt}
  11135: Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt}
  11136: Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  11137: While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  11138: Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt}
  11139: Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt}
  11140: Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt}
  11141: Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt}
  11142: Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt}
  11143: The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt}
  11144: The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt}
  11145: Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt}
  11146: 'Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt}'

  11148: Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}
  11149: Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.${prompt}

  12058: 'While reports of Voidwalker encounters vary greatly in content, one thing is certain: the creatures are gaining in strength, a mounting threat that cannot be left unchecked.${prompt}'
  12059: In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning adventurers to lend their aid.${prompt}
  12060: As the nature of Voidwalker battles renders full-scale military operations unfeasible, we have chosen to stake our success on the mobility and versatility of adventurers.${prompt}
  12061: In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning soldiers of the Allied Forces to lend their aid.${prompt}
  12062: To be sure, there're those who question the wisdom of thinning our ranks in the face of the Shadow Lord's armies. But I assure you, friend, the Voidwalker threat is no less real.${prompt}
  12063: Our scouts regularly bring back intel on locations of suspected Voidwalker presence.${prompt}

    These magicked stones are distributed in regular shipments from our Jeuno-based research team.
    They're the bare minimum we need to have a fighting chance against the enemy.${prompt}
  12067: Voidstones work by realigning your existential spectrum to match that of Voidwalkers, thus rendering the creatures visible to you.${prompt}

  12069: That's provided we have any in stock at all. Much time is required in imbuing them with requisite powers.${prompt}
  12070: The Voidwatch is an organization that exists for the sole purpose of protecting the world from extradimensional invaders we call “Voidwalkers.”${prompt}
  12071: Recognizing the graveness of this threat, the nations of the Middle Lands joined together in common cause and formed the Voidwatch.${prompt}
  12072: Helming the organization is the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, with the remaining three nations contributing resources for its operation.${prompt}
  12073: 'Possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt}'
  12074: It can be earned only through loyal service to your nation, and thus serves as a testimonial for your prowess.${prompt}
  12075: You would do well to obtain one if you haven't already done so.${prompt}
  12076: Affiliation with the Allied Forces of Altana is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt}
  12077: In other words, you must belong to the armed forces of one of the three nations.${prompt}
  12078: The enlistment procedure varies depending on nation. Those wishing to obtain a recommendation letter should pay visit to one of the military encampments surrounding Jeuno.${prompt}
  12079: When you battle a Voidwalker, you must do so as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of the dimension who has harnessed the powers of the voidstone and stratum abyssite.${prompt}
  12080: Bereft of these two objects, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.${prompt}
  12081: However, there are a few points all budding Voidwatchers should bear in mind.${prompt}
  12082: Most crucial of all, the extradimensional nature of being a Voidwatcher renders you isolated and unable to receive help from the outside world.${prompt}
  12083: Scientists attribute this to the dimensional misalignment that occurs. As people are ordinarily unable to see Voidwalkers, so too are they unable to see you.${prompt}
  12084: But you needn't concern yourself with the hows and whys of such matters. It would behoove you far more to become familiar with the workings of the “existential spectrum.”${prompt}
  12085: |-
    You see, each dimension is composed of an existential spectrum to which all things within are aligned.
    In turn, the spectrum is formed of five lights: blue, red, yellow, green, and white.${prompt}
  12086: The alignment of these lights between Voidwalker and Voidwatcher plays an important role in our efforts.${prompt}
  12087: To elaborate, the act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning ourselves to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  12088: Now, while Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with these creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  12089: Compensating measures, however, have been developed to allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe.${prompt}
  12090: One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items,” while another entails performing certain actions against the enemy.${prompt}
  12091: Both methods aim to manipulate the alignment value of individual lights to various ends.${prompt}
  12092: All five lights influence the contents of the treasure chest which appears at the successful end of battle.${prompt}
  12093: Our researchers have succeeded in determining what manner of benefits are associated with each light.${prompt}
  12094: For instance, improving blue spectral alignment is known to produce greater quantities of spoils.${prompt}
  12095: In contrast, manipulating red spectral alignment reportedly enhances the quality of individual items--potions becoming hi-potions, and so forth.${prompt}
  12096: Yellow and green, on the other hand, influence experience gain and cruor yield respectively.${prompt}
  12097: If you wish to know more about the curious red substance we call cruor, you need but ask.${prompt}
  12098: |-
    Lastly, we have white spectral alignment, which is unique even in this company.
    It has been determined to affect the appearance of transdimensional objects such as atmacite and periapt.${prompt}
  12099: Research regarding these artifacts is still ongoing.${prompt}
  12100: Lastly, be reassured that there're no known negative effects of manipulating spectral alignment. We unreservedly encourage all Voidwatch operatives to endeavor towards maximum alignment.${prompt}
  12101: Ascent items are unique objects that can be used to manipulate the spectral alignment of corresponding lights in the existential spectrum.${prompt}
  12102: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are representative of such items.
    They're the pride and joy of our Jeuno-based research team, who'd have folk believe they're the greatest inventions since airships.${prompt}
  12103: (Just between you and me, though, it is Far Eastern scientists that pioneered the technology they're based upon.)${prompt}
  12104: They're not the only means by which we manipulate spectral alignment, mind you. Similar results can be achieved by performing specific actions against the enemy.${prompt}
  12105: Truth be told, much is still shrouded in mystery. What actions will produce the desired effect is something you will have to discover for yourself through trial and error.${prompt}
  12106: Defeating a Voidwalker will cause a mysterious pyxis to emerge at the selfsame planar rift whence the creature was felled.${prompt}
  12107: 'Such riftworn pyxides exhibit a most peculiar characteristic: the content they bear reportedly changes depending on who glimpses within.${prompt}'
  12108: |-
    Our scientists conjecture that this is due to some trick of spectral alignment. As with numerous other mysteries surrounding Voidwalkers, however, I highly doubt they have even an inkling of understanding.
    But I digress...${prompt}
  12109: Only one combatant need possess a voidstone for all party or alliance members to do battle with a Voidwalker. Of the other squad members only stratum abyssite is required.${prompt}
  12110: |-
    As always seems to be the case, however, there is a catch.
    Pyxides have been observed to yield less spoils for combatants without a voidstone of their own.${prompt}
  12111: It scarce needs be said, but it would be to your benefit to have both the aforementioned items readied before taking on a Voidwalker.${prompt}
  12112: |-
    Lastly, a warning: pyxides will eventually vanish if left untouched overlong.
    Our scientists have put forth the theory of normalizing spatial dissonance, but you needn't concern yourself with their mumbo-jumbo.${prompt}
  12113: Just see to it that your hard-earned spoils are claimed in good time, and things will be rosy for all involved.${prompt}
  12114: 'The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is a magicked object produced by the Voidwatch''s Jeuno-based research wing.${prompt}'
  12115: Its innocuous appearance belies the immense power it holds...the power to render Voidwalkers visible to its bearer.${prompt}
  12116: The stone achieves this feat by realigning our existential spectrum to that of the creature.${prompt}
  12117: I shall explain the process in layman's terms for your benefit. No need to thank me--I merely perform my duty.${prompt}
  12118: I want you to visualize two canvases, each the same distance from the other. Yes, as two separate objects are normally wont to be.${prompt}
  12119: Imagine you and I standing on one of the canvases--what else does one do with a canvas but stand on it, yes?${prompt}
  12120: Now, imagine Voidwalkers standing on the other canvas, doing whatever it is Voidwalkers do. Destroying things and behaving with utter impropriety, no doubt.${prompt}
  12121: |-
    Being on two different canvases, it follows that we cannot touch the Voidwalkers, let alone see them.
    Actually, that doesn't explain why we can't see the Voidwalkers...unless it's a magical canvas they're on that makes all things upon it invisible! Yes, that'll serve!${prompt}
  12122: And this brings us full circle back to the voidstone. I want you to think of it as a magical paintbrush that we use to...grapple ourselves over to the Voidwalkers' canvas. Thence the fighting begins.${prompt}
  12123: |-
    I trust you now have a rudimentary understanding of the process. That's all you need, really.
    Leave the fractal geometry to the fractal geometrists, I always say.${prompt}
  12124: |-
    As long as you remember the canvas and the paintbrush--that's the voidstone--you cannot go astray.
    Now, to apprise you of more practical matters...${prompt}
  12125: Twenty hours (Earth time) is required to produce a stone and imbue it with the necessary magicks, although word is that this may be shortened as research progresses.${prompt}
  12126: |-
    Mind you, this isn't the only variety of stone you'll be needing.
    There exists another: stratum abyssite.${prompt}
  12127: |-
    Whereas the voidstone serves as a power source, acting as a compass for channeling that power is stratum abyssite.
    Only by using the two in conjunction can we achieve our objectives.${prompt}
  12128: |-
    Are you familiar with ${color: 5}voiddust${color: 1}?
    Put simply, it is a granular substance from which voidstones may be fabricated.${prompt}
  12129: |-
    As I explained, significant time is required to produce a voidstone from scratch.
    Provide me with voiddust, however, and I can fashion a stone for you in short order.${prompt}
  12130: |-
    The same comrades of ours who stock ascent items may also furnish you with voiddust.
    Why do they not fabricate the stones themselves, or deliver the dust directly to me?
    Shush! The Voidwatch works in mysterious ways, and it would behoove you to inquire no further.${prompt}
  12131: |-
    At any rate, should you manage to obtain any ${color: 5}voiddust${color: 1} in your travels, you need only return here and trade it to me.
    Simple enough, wouldn't you say?${prompt}
  12132: Furthermore, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.${prompt}
  12133: Based on the evolutionary state of your stratum abyssite, the Voidwatch will direct you to a suitable operation area.${prompt}
  12134: If you wish to have your stone analyzed, simply present it to an atma refiner.${prompt}
  12135: |-
    Planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space--have manifested across the land.
    The Voidwalker hordes roam beyond, unchecked and ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt}
  12136: By invoking the power of stratum abyssite, it is possible to battle the fell creatures as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of our dimension.${prompt}
  12137: Those also possessed of a voidstone will find their Voidwatcher experience greatly enhanced.${prompt}
  12138: Alone, however, stratum abyssite serves no purpose; only when used in conjunction with a voidstone can its powers be unleashed.${prompt}
  12139: Hence, at least one member of your squad--be it party or alliance--must possess a voidstone in order to arrange a confrontation with a Voidwalker.${prompt}
  12140: Keep this fact in mind at all times.${prompt}
  12141: It is not known when the planar rifts first manifested. Some say they've always been there, while others claim recent events have triggered their appearance.${prompt}
  12142: If only we could return to the past, perhaps we could shed some light upon this mystery...${prompt}
  12143: Obtainable by defeating Voidwalkers, cruor is an energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt}
  12144: While appearing to be some manner of mineral, detailed analysis has revealed that cruor is in fact organic.${prompt}
  12145: |-
    As far as our researchers can tell, however, it's inanimate like most well-behaved plants.
    There's no fear of cruor suddenly springing to life in your palms.${prompt}
  12146: Being supremely pleasing to the eyes, cruor might have adorned the display cases of many a jewelry shop during peacetime. Unfortunately, the age demands that its unique properties be put to more practical uses.${prompt}

    We, the Meeble Burrows Exploration Committee, have left no stone--figurative or real--unturned in our search for answers about this elusive species.

  12265: |-
    You adventurers can help us collect data by embarking on certain expeditions belowground.
    The goals and activities for each journey you undertake will vary, so this won't be just some routine experiment.${prompt}
  12266: |-
    Although these subterranean caverns may appear simplistic from the outside, their twisting corridors disorient even the Moblins.
    Be careful.${prompt}
  12267: Of course, you'll have to prove your problem-solving skills during more forgiving operations before we let you tackle the truly scary stuff.${prompt}
  12268: |-
    Each expedition has a total of three goals for you to achieve. Complete just one goal or up to all three--the choice is yours.
    However, it should go without saying that the more goals you achieve, the better the reward.${prompt}
  12269: Lastly, the caves are no place for a solo adventurer to be traipsing about. We'll need you to travel in groups of three or more.${prompt}
  12270: |-
    Grimoires are types of magical books that ancient sorcerers brandished in battle long, long ago.

    What's the point of adapting them for use in the burrows? Why, to record the feats of explorers like you.
    Without them, it would be much harder to complete expeditions.${prompt}

  12285: Oh, and before I forget--for particularly grueling endeavors, everyone must sign up individually. The higher-ups like to think of it as “exonerating the committee from responsibility” or something I don't understand.${prompt}
  12286: 'After signing up, you''ll <cough> almost <cough> be ready to set off. The thing is...Meebles${choice: 0}[/, like that one over there,/, like that one over there,] roam the mouth of the burrows.${prompt}'
  12287: They don't trust anyone but the Moblins, so you'll have to dance like Moblins, prance like Moblins, and even romance like Moblins to gain access to the caves.${prompt}
  12288: |-
    ...Actually, you'll only need to stink like Moblins.
    I can give you ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} in exchange for a grimoire to make sure you smell the part.${prompt}
  12289: |-
    Don't worry, this method is tried and true.
    Meebles have very bad eyesight, so they mostly use their sense of smell to determine who's who.${prompt}
  12290: 'That sense of smell, however, is unrivaled. Even if you''re the only one who isn''t carrying ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}, they''ll sniff you out in an instant.${prompt}'
  12291: In fact, the only reason I haven't been turned into Galka gristle after standing here so long is because I keep one on me at all times.${prompt}
  12292: 'Once the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} does its thing and the Meebles take you down into their burrows, you''re free to experiment all you want.${prompt}'
  12293: '...Oh, but if you ever let enthusiasm get the best of you and forget your objectives, just use ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} to remind yourself.${prompt}'
  12294: There should be Speleological Handbooks secretly placed by our members all over the burrows.${prompt}
  12295: 'Holding your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} up to one should do the trick.${prompt}'
  12296: They can also serve as a way to record your underground activities.${prompt}
  12297: Once you finish an expedition, any information you record will have to be reflected in your grimoire.${prompt}
  12298: 'You''ll be given ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} after completing an expedition.${prompt}'
  12299: 'One puff on your ${item-singular: 1[2]} will allow your whole posse to climb back aboveground.${prompt}'
  12300: 'After making your escape, there''s only one thing left to do. Pay a visit to either the appropriate Burrow Researcher or me and show him your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}'

  12303: 'If you ever need to escape before completing an expedition, though, you can always use ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} instead.${prompt}'
  12304: |-
    Sadly, using ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} allows only its bearer to come up for air.
    Don't forget to show your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} once you exit, even if you've bowed out midway through.${prompt}
  12305: |-
    There's nothing wrong with leaving in the middle of an expedition.
    You'll never be penalized for it, as we wouldn't want to weaken your adventuring spirit.${prompt}
  12306: 'Oh, and if you''ve been wondering how to get ahold of one of these ${item-plural: 3[2]}, you''ll get one from the Meeble guarding the entrance.${prompt}'
  12307: |-
    Some scary, twisted fiends roam the depths of these caverns...at least that's what our scouts who come back alive tell me.
    Of course, you'll likely come face-to-face with these nightmares, too.${prompt}
  12308: |-
    Why? Well, because you'll be tasked with culling one of them after completing the first four expeditions in a course.
    That's why.${prompt}
  12309: Whether you choose to accept such a dangerous mission is all up to you. However, keep this in mind.${prompt}
  12310: Accepting such an assignment means you'll never get back any grimoires we're holding for you.${prompt}
  12311: |-
    That's right. We'll need to archive all the precious data you've collected.
    Jeuno wasn't built in a day, and the same goes for our analysis of Meeble Burrows.${prompt}
  12312: Oh, I almost forgot. For extremely harrowing journeys such as these, everyone must sign up individually.${prompt}
  12313: This way we can be absolutely sure that everyone's prepared for the task at hand. We wouldn't want people without enough experience getting hurt down there.${prompt}
  12314: In return for your cooperation (or to make sure you truly survive), I'll bestow on your whole party the boons everyone has received up until now.${prompt}
  12315: This way you'll all be at your best to face the worst...in the name of science!${prompt}
  12316: This may seem obvious, but you can't just mull around all you want down there.${prompt}
  12317: 'Even if you can use ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to confuse the Meebles, they aren''t stupid enough to ignore you forever.${prompt}'
  12318: |-
    That's why we've set a ${number: 2}-minute limit per expedition (Earth time).
    We want to limit the number of casualties to as few as possible. Safety first, that's our motto.${prompt}
  12319: 'You should also know that we only give out one ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} every ${number: 1} ${choice: 3}[hour/minute]${choice-plurality: 1}[/s] (Earth time).${prompt}'
  12320: |-
    We do want you to be the best researcher you can be, though...
    How about we give you ${number: 3} ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} as a first-time offer? That way you can learn the ropes faster.${prompt}
  12321: It took us a while to realize, but the health of our explorers started failing after they'd carry multiple pouches for long periods of time.${prompt}
  12322: |-
    On the bright side, I'm bound by the Meeble Burrows Exploration Committee code to keep up to ${number: 3} of them for you.
    Don't ask why the pouches don't affect me. And if you make a joke about my mother being a Moblin...${prompt}
  12323: |-
    I may be haler and heartier than the average Galka, but there's only so much of that stench I can take.
    If you need more pouches than I can carry, you'd better get yourself a pherobarrier box.${prompt}
  12324: Mind if I change to a fairer smelling subject now?${prompt}
  12325: 'In the event that the spirits haunting these caverns disallow one of your brethren entry, just return aboveground within three minutes without completing any objectives. You''ll be refunded your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} at no cost!${prompt}'
  12326: How nice of the committee, right? Now you don't have to burst a blood vessel if something happens during your descent.${prompt}
  12327: We may have many limits and regulations, but we're not heartless. We also dole out “research marks” to those who help us learn about Meeble Burrows.${prompt}
  12328: |-
    How do you get them? It's simple.
    The more you accomplish down there, the more marks you receive. You can also turn in marks for certain items and equipment.${prompt}
  12329: |-
    There's no need to be a forlorn funguar, either.
    The more fellow researchers on your expedition, the more marks you reap. “The more the merrier” has never rung more true!${prompt}
  12330: Our results suggest that Meebles are rather docile creatures, with little if any culture to speak of. They shouldn't pose much of a threat.${prompt}
  12331: They're easily manipulated, though, and the Moblins have taken advantage of that. They put the Meebles to work in caverns all over the realm.${prompt}
  12332: |-
    Meeble Burrows may be a quaint name, but what sort of fiends lurk amongst these dank caverns? Why are the Moblins making Meebles do their dirty work? And how large are these underground tunnels anyway?
    Maybe we haven't learned as much about the Meebles and their habitat as we thought...${prompt}
  12333: |-
    Wait...if you don't mind crawling through caves and dirtying your own hands for a good cause, how about joining in the exploration?
    We could use another pair of eyes down there. Just talk to me when you decide you'd like to help the scientific community.${prompt}
  12334: I'm sure I don't have to lecture you on receiving certain boons from your grimoire depending on the expeditions you've completed.${prompt}
  12335: But you do remember that boons from one grimoire can't be applied to another, right?${prompt}
  12336: Even worse, you build a relationship with your grimoire only to have it stolen away from you by some unfeeling bookworms right before you set off to slay the most fearsome of monsters!${prompt}
  12337: Well, even if you don't remember, those days are long gone! That's the wonderful thing about science--it progresses!${prompt}
  12338: We've identified unique arcane essences that are released with the completion of some goals and imbue the ink of our pens as we record your exploits.${prompt}
  12339: |-
    Using these essences, we can reconstruct the boons you've received from your grimoire records.
    Let me explain.${prompt}
  12340: 'If you had completed Adjunct Expedition #1, we could inscribe the boons from that expedition onto a blank grimoire.${prompt}'
  12341: Of course the boon would be the same as the one granted from completing that expedition...except for the fact that we can only inscribe level one boons into grimoires. Sorry, but the process is not yet perfect.${prompt}
  12342: |-
    Want to know what else isn't perfect? These inscriptions aren't free.
    It's sad, but grimoires and pheromone sacks don't sprout from the ground, you know!${prompt}
  12343: Meebles use their long sniffers to snuff up odds and ends from the burrow floor.${prompt}
  12344: According to our latest scouting report, they dredged up some things called... Give me a minute here...${prompt}
  12345: |-
    Palimpsests?
    I may not have the biggest brain this side of the Sea of Shu'Meyo, but I do know that these papers are some powerful stuff.${prompt}
  12346: The MBEC now also gives away wizened worms to adventurers who complete objectives.${prompt}
  12347: |-
    Meebles love their wizened worms, and how.
    Quite a non sequitur I pulled on you, right?${prompt}
  12348: |-
    Except it's not!
    Give the Meebles that guard the burrow entrances some of those water-starved wrigglers and they'll give you stuff in return...possibly even some parades...sorry, palisades...uh, palimpsests.${prompt}
  12349: |-
    Ridiculous name, I know. I can barely say it.
    These palimpsests are types of magical paper that temporarily aid everyone in your troop.${prompt}
  12350: All you need to do is trade it to the grimoire inside the caverns and you're good to go.${prompt}
  12351: I haven't been able to use it myself yet, so this might not be true. Still, a friend of a friend told me that while each piece of parchment has three possible effects, you can only choose one!${prompt}
  12352: Don't worry, he assures me that you can choose your desired effect through the wonders of that grimoire down there.${prompt}
  12353: If you want the beat-'em-up power of all three effects, though, you'll need to gather three pieces of parchment.${prompt}

  12542: I've seen futures both brighter and darker, but in each at least there was a future.${prompt}
  12543: Ah, but those feathered wings represent a new hope. A possibility to ensure that what should come to be...does come to be.${prompt}
  12544: Perhaps it's best if we not paw around here, and consult Atomos instead. Ask his opinion.${prompt}

  12606: Are you quite sure?${prompt}
  12607: They shook me to the core. A blackness deeper than a starless night enveloped the world, and the screams of a thousand souls pierced the air.${prompt}
  12608: I wanted to reach out to them, but instead of grasping their hands I began to float upward, my form bound by light.${prompt}
  12609: I became one with that selfsame light...and the last thing I saw was your face.${prompt}
  12610: Your visage was even more noble than usual, and you had become...a god.${prompt}
  12611: Huh? You had a different dream?${prompt}
  12612: Wh-what!? That's an ill omen if I ever heard one!${prompt}
  12613: Could such terror truly be what the world has in store for us?${prompt}

    Then in my dreams...all that light...
    Was it just a fraud, and I'm totally powerless!?${prompt}

  12618: Hehe! I knew I should have had more confidence in you!${prompt}
  12619: And so...do you have a plan to meet with Altana?${prompt}
  12620: You say Cait Sith was on about meeting Altana being our only chance. But I wonder...${prompt}
  12621: Maybe we'll be able to think of something if we put our heads together.${prompt}
  12622: ${name-player}, you're really something else.${prompt}
  12623: You're right. Maybe we can come up with something if we put our heads together.${prompt}
  12624: I'm not sure exactly how to go about it, though.${prompt}
  12625: Cait Sith said that our best bet may lie in meeting with Altana?${prompt}
  12626: Even if we are the wings of the Goddess, that doesn't mean we have all the answers.${prompt}
  12627: We might have to rack our brains for this one...${prompt}
  12628: S-sorry for stepping out of line.${prompt}
  12629: I might not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but that doesn't mean I can't try my best to come up with something.${prompt}
  12630: After all, it's up to us to protect both the future and the past--and I hope you'd expect nothing less of me!${prompt}
  12631: So...Cait Sith said that meeting Altana might be our only shot?${prompt}
  12632: We might be the Goddess's wings, but...well, nothing pops right to mind.${prompt}
  12633: Maybe we'll find a solution if we put our heads together.${prompt}
  12634: Oh? What is...
  12635: Goodness! By the stars, what just happened!?${prompt}
  12636: That was no dream, right? Or was it? I...I saw the future!${prompt}
  12637: Nothing super far away, mind you, but something close that the two of us can bring about together!${prompt}
  12638: ${name-player}, not only did I see the future, but also the past. Memories of the times we spent together, both warm and cold. A phantasmagoric kaleidoscope of images.${prompt}
  12639: You're...absolutely sure I'm not dead? Hehehe!${prompt}
  12640: Something awful's happened! Not good at all!
  12641: If it isn't that odd kitty cat!

  12652: That orb you carry...the light erased all my doubts and fears. I'm ready for whatever may come to pass.${prompt}
  12653: Together we have the strength to conquer the darkness!${prompt}
  12654: I'll be waiting for you in the Walk of Echoes.${prompt}
  12655: And this Walk of Echoes...we can get there from a cavernous maw?${prompt}
  12656: Got it! I'll meet you there!${prompt}
