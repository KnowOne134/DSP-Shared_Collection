  7164: 'Oh, sorry. He won''t eat ${item-plural: 6[2]}. But he might like ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} .${prompt}'
  7165: 'I''m sorry. Except for feeding time, the master scolds us when we give them ${item-plural: 6[2]}. I know... It''s the thought that counts.${prompt}'
  7166: Well, looks like he's used to you now!${prompt}
  7167: Good job! Now you're a qualified chocobo rider.${prompt}
  7168: Now that you can read animals' minds, maybe you can become a beastmaster. Of course, I can't teach you how... You'll just have to practice.${prompt}
  7169: The rest is up to you, kiddo. For now, take this to the stables.${prompt}
  7170: The rest is up to you, kiddo. For now, take this to the stables.${prompt}
  7171: The master sure was profound, talking about reading their minds... At least we know the last owner didn't have that gift!${prompt}
  7172: The master sure was profound, talking about reading their minds... At least we know the last owner didn't have that gift!${prompt}
  7173: If you can read their minds, you might have what it takes to be a beastmaster. But no teachin' can help you there... No sirree!${prompt}
  7174: Come to think of it, I wonder what happened to that cowardly chocobo handler?${prompt}
  7175: Oh, haven't you heard? He's been home taking care of his son ever since he got sick.${prompt}
  7176: Well, that's what he gets for treating his chocobos so badly. Serves him right!${prompt}
  7177: What are you talking about? He was out of control, but his poor little boy never hurt anybody!${prompt}
  7178: Yeah. you're right. I heard his kid was shocked at what his dad was doing, too.${prompt}
  7179: Maybe if that brute was softer on his chocobos, his kid would get better. What do you think?${prompt}
  7180: Well, look at who you're talking about. I don't think it's even possible... Feel bad about the kid, though.${prompt}
  7181: Kweh!${prompt}
  7182: Aw, what's the matter?${prompt}
  7183: That was a sad chirp. Why are you so down all of a sudden?${prompt}
  7184: Ha-ha! He's so docile now.${prompt}
  7185: I'd hate to see him go, but maybe sending him back would be the best thing for him.${prompt}
  7186: He just got up and ran away. We were so worried. He came right back, covered in mud. But I wonder where he went?${prompt}
  7187: Why, howdy there! How you been, huh? You look fit as a fiddle! So, what can I...${prompt}
  7188: Master!${prompt}
  7189: 'Hey, what do you think you''re... ${wait-animation: 2}${prompt}'
  7190: Look, he's afraid of you!${prompt}
  7191: Wait... He's happy about something. What could this mean?${prompt}
  7192: There you are... Thank you! You're the reason my son's recovered.${prompt}
  7193: I beat you and whipped you for so long. Why did you decide to help me?${prompt}
  7194: Do you understand me? No, I can't thank you enough for all you've done for me. I truly thank you.${prompt}
  7195: And you, too! Thanks.${prompt}
  7196: I'm a beastmaster no more. But I bet you can become a great beastmaster if you keep at it.${prompt}
  7197: And I'm sorry I said those things to you before.${prompt}
  7198: Hey, don't worry about it.${prompt}
  7199: I'm not worthy of chocobos anymore. Please, take care of him for me.${prompt}
  7200: You got it. He'll grow up big and strong.${prompt}
  7201: You stay right there.${prompt}
  7202: Mark my words. Someday, he'll come back for his chocobo.${prompt}
  7203: And the chocobo will gladly go with him. After all, he's a beastmaster.${prompt}
  7204: All's well that ends well, right? Now you can call yourself a beastmaster. Stand tall, kiddo!${prompt}
  7205: You can now become a beastmaster.${prompt}
  7206: Aw, man! I wanna be a beastmaster someday, too!${prompt}
  7207: What? Oh, that guy's kid got better? Well, that's good to hear. I'd like to have him over sometime.${prompt}
  7208: Looks like no one's home.${prompt}
  7209: Hi, Galmut!${prompt}
  7210: Hey, Collet! Stay right there. I'm almost done!${prompt}
  7211: Okay!${prompt}
  7212: The clock is always spot on, thanks to Galmut. He gives the gears a good oiling each and every day.${prompt}
  7213: Whew... Well, how've you been? You've been going to school, right?${prompt}
  7214: Uh, yeah... Sorta.${prompt}
  7215: Sorta? What's that supposed to mean? Sounds to me like you're playing hooky!${prompt}
  7216: Yeah... But your voice always brings a smile to my face.${prompt}
  7217: Is that so? Well, childhood ain't all about studying. Isn't that right?${prompt}
  7218: ★★★★★★Bell Rings★★★★★★${prompt}
  7219: She's right on time! Heh, I maintain that clock.${prompt}
  7220: At first it was a boring job, but now I see how fun it really is.${prompt}
  7221: That clock needs lots of attention, or else she goes off right away. She's such a delicate creature.${prompt}
  7222: Every time I hear her ring, I feel like I've woken this town up.${prompt}
  7223: Every day, I see the same people pass by when I clean the gears, and they stop and wave hello.${prompt}
  7224: Sometimes, when I don't see one of them, I start to worry if they're okay.${prompt}
  7225: I had my eye on a certain girl...${prompt}
  7226: Till one day, I saw her with some other guy. Man, that hurt.${prompt}
  7227: Well, anyway... The longer I worked, the more I felt like I was actually helping everyone. That made me happy.${prompt}
  7228: I'm having too much fun, aren't I?${prompt}
  7229: Yeah, way too much!${prompt}
  7230: Hey, I wasn't asking you.${prompt}
  7231: Well, I'd better get home soon. Take care!${prompt}
  7232: Nice meeting you. See you tomorrow!${prompt}
  7233: Galmut's working on the clock. Don't interrupt him.${prompt}
  7234: I'm so scared of school. I told Galmut I think everyone hates me. But he said that couldn't be true.${prompt}
  7235: Oh, it's you... Sorry, but I'm right in the middle of something. Could you come back later?${prompt}
  7236: Well, look who's here! Welcome to my humble abode.${prompt}
  7237: I've got lots of wacky stuff, don't I?${prompt}
  7238: Heh. They may be scrap, but they're all priceless things a certain person gave me.${prompt}
  7239: Hey, what are you doin'? That's my bed!${prompt}
  7240: Anybody home?${prompt}
  7241: Well, speak of the devil... It's Mr. Narihira!${prompt}
  7242: I see you're still kickin'.${prompt}
  7243: Hah! You post-war youngsters ain't got nothin' on my generation!${prompt}
  7244: Well, it's good to see you.${prompt}
  7245: How's the clock, Galmut?${prompt}
  7246: I've been taking good care of her. Don't tell me you can't hear her ring!${prompt}
  7247: Huh? What did you say? Just kiddin'. Of course I hear her fine!${prompt}
  7248: But I hear the gears struggling a little. Might be time to give her some oil.${prompt}
  7249: Well, you haven't changed a bit!${prompt}
  7250: And I see you've got a friend over!${prompt}
  7251: Listen here, young one. Galmut's a model citizen now, but he was a regular hooligan before!${prompt}
  7252: Oh, no, not that again!${prompt}
  7253: Ohohoho! Defensive, aren't we? Anyway, Galmut came to Jeuno about three years ago...${prompt}
  7254: He came to the big city to make his mark. Every day he worked from sunrise to sunset!${prompt}
  7255: And when I finally got enough dough to open my own shop...${prompt}
  7256: I got conned out of all of it. I lost every last gil...${prompt}
  7257: And that really shook him! He lost faith in his fellow man...scowling at everyone like a starving dog.${prompt}
  7258: That's when Mr. Narihira offered me a job in the clock tower.${prompt}
  7259: At first I thought he was just another con man. But once I started, I really enjoyed it.${prompt}
  7260: You know, you work so hard in there that when you finally hear the bell ring... Man, it echoes right to the heart!${prompt}
  7261: And I was glad to find someone who'd carry on in my place.${prompt}
  7262: Oh yeah... I almost forgot!${prompt}
  7263: 'We need ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}. And with the beastmen on the rampage, the store''s almost out.${prompt}'
  7264: No way, really? Without oil, we...${prompt}
  7265: Maybe the Tenshodo still has some. I hate doing business with their kind, though.${prompt}
  7266: 'Me, too... Hey, I know! Would you mind bringing us ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}?${prompt}'
  7267: We'd be so grateful. She's such a delicate machine... Without it, I'm afraid she'd go haywire!${prompt}
  7268: |-
    Will you help them?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    Not right now.${prompt}
  7269: All right! Thanks a bunch!${prompt}
  7270: First, head over to the Tenshodo, here in Jeuno.${prompt}
  7271: Oh, yeah? Well, tell me if you change your mind. We've gotta do something.${prompt}
  7272: 'Oh, it''s you. We still can''t find any ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  7273: Mr. Narihira said that the Tenshodo has some. Without it, sooner or later the gears will come to a stop!${prompt}
  7274: Who's there!?${prompt}
  7275: Oh, you... Thanks for bringing the oil, but we don't need it anymore!${prompt}
  7276: I heard they're gonna tear her down and make her into some kinda crane to lift cargo from ships.${prompt}
  7277: The plan's already passed. Ain't nothing I can do now!${prompt}
  7278: 'Well, I''ll go ahead and take that ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}. Thanks for trying, ${choice-player-gender}[pal/though]. This is for you.${prompt}'
  7279: I try to believe in something, and look what happens!${prompt}
  7280: Galmut, it's me! You here?${prompt}
  7281: Oh, it's you. Where's Galmut?${prompt}
  7282: He's out, huh? And he heard about the clock? He must've been shocked.${prompt}
  7283: 'That''s Galmut for you. Look, if we get enough signatures with ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, we might be able to stop the plan!${prompt}'
  7284: 'They''re going to take down the clock. Narihira said we could get ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry but I don''t know what he means.${prompt}'
  7285: Galmut was so shocked. But there's nothing I can do. He's the one who always cheers me up.${prompt}
  7286: Galmut won't come out, no matter how much I call for him. I wonder what's wrong...${prompt}
  7287: But the clock seem to be working all right. I wonder who's keeping it running... It's one of the seven wonders of Jeuno!${prompt}
  7288: Huh? You want me to sign? If it'll help Galmut, you bet!${prompt}
  7289: What's that?${prompt}
  7290: What!? You've...${prompt}
  7291: I heard somebody started a petition. But it was you? Galmut should be happy to have such a good friend.${prompt}
  7292: I wonder where he ran off to, anyway. How pathetic!${prompt}
  7293: 'Everyone''s out to get me! It''s all over!${wait-animation: 3}${prompt}'
  7294: Mr. Narihira... And you... What are you doing here?${prompt}
  7295: Shut your trap and listen for once! Your friend here's gathered so many signatures, the petition to save the clock tower was a success!${prompt}
  7296: Huh? Petition? Does that mean her gears'll keep turning?${prompt}
  7297: Of course, you fool! Right now, you're the stopped clock.${prompt}
  7298: You know what that means, don'tcha? No more resounding rings. Catch my drift, sonny?${prompt}
  7299: Mr. Narihira... I'm sorry.${prompt}
  7300: Hell, I don't care how you feel!${prompt}
  7301: You gotta face all the people out there who count on that clock! Without the bells each day...${prompt}
  7302: 'Ugh...${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  7303: Mr. Narihira!${prompt}
  7304: Oh, I'm all right. I just kept the clock going while you were gone. And by golly, I was rustier than she was!${prompt}
  7305: I don't know how to thank you. Nobody's ever cared enough to talk straight to me.${prompt}
  7306: Hah! What kinda moron likes getting chewed out!?${prompt}
  7307: Besides, I think there's someone else you should be thankin'. Your precious clock'd be scrap if it weren't for ${choice-player-gender}[him/her].${prompt}
  7308: I don't know what to say... Or how to thank you... This ain't much, but it means a lot to me. Please, I want you to have it.${prompt}
  7309: I'm so grateful. I'll make sure nothing ever happens to that clock, because it's what binds all the people together.${prompt}
  7310: I believe you, Galmut.${prompt}
  7311: Well, you got your work cut out for you. Get to it, kiddo!${prompt}
  7312: Hi, Galmut!${prompt}
  7313: Hey, Collet! I gotta stay and finish up.. And is that ${name-player} next to you? Thanks to you, I know how happy I am!${prompt}
  7314: Galmut's got back into the swing of things. And I'm feeling better, too! Hmm, I think I'll head back to school again.${prompt}
  7315: Oh, it's you, huh? Galmut's workin' hard as ever, thanks to you. Do me a favor and check up on him once in a while, okay?${prompt}
  7316: Hmm, maybe I could ask ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]... Oh, it's nothing! Never mind.${prompt}
  7317: Say, are you heading to Davoi?${prompt}
  7318: 'Then you''ll need this ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}. You can''t break the inner seal without it.${prompt}'
  7319: 'I want to trade this for ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}. What do you say?${prompt}'
  7320: |-
    Will you bring me ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'll do it for the crest.
    Not right now.${prompt}
  7321: All right! Thanks! You can find coeurls on the Sauromugue Champaign.${prompt}
  7322: Aw, man! Well, come back if you change your mind.${prompt}
  7323: 'Did you find ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}? I''ve heard there are coeurls on the Sauromugue Champaign. Be careful!${prompt}'
  7324: Ah, yes! This is what I need. Thanks!${prompt}
  7325: 'Alrighty. Here''s the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}, just like I promised.${prompt}'
  7326: 'What? You want to know what I''m going to use this ${item-singular: 6[2]} for?${prompt}'
  7327: To tell you the truth, my sister's not well.${prompt}
  7328: Hey, Audia... It's me. Remember?${prompt}
  7329: 'I want meat! Bring me ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, drenched in bright red blood!${prompt}'
  7330: Quickly... Make haste or I'll devour you!${prompt}
  7331: Okay, okay... I brought you some, so don't give me that evil look anymore!${prompt}
  7332: Ahahaha... Such delicious-looking meat. The fat, so perfectly marbled!${prompt}
  7333: Aumfch... Mmmm! Ahh... Fresh meat!${prompt}
  7334: My sister was so nice before she got sick. She was so looking forward to marrying Albrecht.${prompt}
  7335: But one day, after she came back from a picnic with Alista, she got a headache and stayed in bed. Then, she got like that.${prompt}
  7336: Everybody says she's under some kind of curse. Albrecht's been praying at the temple every day, hoping for relief.${prompt}
  7337: I heard the crest would lift the curse, but it didn't work either.${prompt}
  7338: But I don't think she's cursed at all! She's never done anything bad to get cursed like that!${prompt}
  7339: Oh, Audia...${prompt}
  7340: I don't like to show her like this, but I don't know what to do anymore.${prompt}
  7341: That fiancé of hers, Albrecht, is always at the temple.${prompt}
  7342: Well? Any news?${prompt}
  7343: |-
    Did you learn anything about her sickness?
    ${selection-lines}
    Nope, nothing.
    As a matter of fact...${prompt}
  7344: Really? Well, thanks for trying.${prompt}
  7345: Don't bother. I know you're just trying to cheer me up.${prompt}
  7346: Hey, Baudin. How's she doing?${prompt}
  7347: She's still the same, Albrecht.${prompt}
  7348: Really... Well, it's only a matter of time, since I pray for her each and every day.${prompt}
  7349: No way! She won't get better!${prompt}
  7350: Baudin, what are you saying?${prompt}
  7351: She's never done anything bad! It can't be a curse. You can pray all you want, but she won't get better!${prompt}
  7352: What's gotten into you? I'll come back later. Try to settle down and compose yourself before I get back.${prompt}
  7353: Baudin, what is it? You were so deep in thought, you didn't see me, did you?${prompt}
  7354: No, it's nothing.${prompt}
  7355: Okay, that's fine, then. So, how is she?${prompt}
  7356: No change, really. I wonder... Did you see anything strange when you two went out picnicking?${prompt}
  7357: No, nothing at all.${prompt}
  7358: I think she'll get better.${prompt}
  7359: Yeah, I hope so.${prompt}
  7360: Well, try to cheer up!${prompt}
  7361: Okay?${prompt}
  7362: Hmm... There must be something I can do!${prompt}
  7363: |-
    I wish I knew what to do...
    If you ever find a cure for my sister, please let me know.${prompt}
  7364: Oh, you think that could cure her? I heard it's a terrible place, so be very, very careful. I'll pray for your safety!${prompt}
  7365: What? This might be a cure? Thanks so much! Now, hurry!${prompt}
  7366: All right... Audia, you'll feel better in no time!${prompt}
  7367: Wait, Baudin! That's no cure. It'll make her worse!${prompt}
  7368: Albrecht? And Alista... How do you know that?${prompt}
  7369: My sister told me.${prompt}
  7370: I-I'm so sorry. I knew how to cure her sickness.${prompt}
  7371: Wh-what!? What's going on?${prompt}
  7372: When we went out that day, I saw a ghost come and possess her. I knew we had to exorcise her...${prompt}
  7373: I'm so sorry. I didn't want to lose my brother to her.${prompt}
  7374: That's why I kept my mouth shut. I hoped that if Audia never recovered, then my brother would give up someday.${prompt}
  7375: But I was wrong. He really, really loves her. Now I know.${prompt}
  7376: And I couldn't see Audia suffer anymore. Please, forgive me!${prompt}
  7377: I...${prompt}
  7378: Baudin, I want you to forgive us both. I knew that Alista hated Audia, but I didn't suspect a thing.${prompt}
  7379: Even if you don't forgive us, please, give this to Audia now!${prompt}
  7380: What's this? And how...?${prompt}
  7381: It should chase the spirit away. Monsters there wounded me, but my pain is nothing compared to what Audia has suffered.${prompt}
  7382: Albrecht, Alista... It's okay. I believe you.${prompt}
  7383: Audia, Albrecht ventured into the maw of peril to find a cure for you. Now, I want you to try hard and get better!${prompt}
  7384: Ngraarrr! Damn you all! You found it!? URRRNGAHHH!!!${prompt}
  7385: Uhh... Whew...${prompt}
  7386: Huh!? Where am... Oh, I'm home? What... What's happened to me?${prompt}
  7387: Audia!${prompt}
  7388: Baudin, what's going on? Now, now... Don't cry.${prompt}
  7389: My dear Audia... It's all right. Everything's fine.${prompt}
  7390: Audia!${prompt}
  7391: What are you all doing here? I can't remember anything!${prompt}
  7392: Forgive me! Please, forgive me!${prompt}
  7393: Alista, don't be afraid. Just because they marry, it doesn't mean you'll be alone all of a sudden.${prompt}
  7394: What?${prompt}
  7395: You'll come live with us, right?${prompt}
  7396: Wait... You'll really forgive what I did?${prompt}
  7397: Of course! I think I know how you feel.${prompt}
  7398: I'm so sorry, Audia. I should never have let that happen to you.${prompt}
  7399: Baudin...${prompt}
  7400: And you, stranger. I thank you.${prompt}
  7401: I simply refused to face reality. I am ashamed...${prompt}
  7402: I forgot that we must first do what we are capable of, before we seek divine help.${prompt}
  7403: There are times when we face adversity, yet still must do something.${prompt}
  7404: Through prayer, we gain the strength and hope to go on. But then we must take action!${prompt}
  7405: This is for you. For trying to help Audia, and for making me realize the truth. Use it well!${prompt}
  7406: Baudin, let me take care of Audia now. I'll never let this kind of thing happen to her ever again. I promise!${prompt}
  7407: Please, Baudin. I beg you!${prompt}
  7408: No, it's okay! I know you can take good care of her.${prompt}
  7409: Thank you, Baudin.${prompt}
  7410: Audia...${prompt}
  7411: Oh, Albrecht...${prompt}
  7412: Looks like she's okay now. Thanks for helping us out. It's been forever since I've seen her smile.${prompt}
  7413: What? The clock tower!? Galmut once showed me inside. It was dark and grimy and smelled like oil, but Galmut knew it inside and out.${prompt}
  7414: 'You bet I''ll sign! Also, here''s a secret: Galmut used to have a crush on my sister!${prompt}'
  7415: Oh, hello there. You won't find anything here but memories long gone. Young, sprightly folk like yourself would likely die of boredom!${prompt}
  7416: Hello. I always come and help Ilumida. She has problems with her back, and really can't live on her own anymore.${prompt}
  7417: The war may be over, but the pain is everlasting. Ilumida lost her husband, and people like her suffer each and every day.${prompt}
  7418: Jeuno seems like a lively place, but look deeper and you'll find scars that linger. War is indeed a terrible thing.${prompt}
  7419: Oh, a visitor? What can I do for you?${prompt}
  7420: I am looking for Ilumida. Is she here?${prompt}
  7421: I wonder who that could be. Excuse me, please.${prompt}
  7422: Why, it's Wolfgang! Come in, come in.${prompt}
  7423: I'm glad to see you're doing well. Here, let me give you this month's payment.${prompt}
  7424: Thanks, as always, Wolfgang. You know how grateful I am.${prompt}
  7425: No, it's what my father wanted.${prompt}
  7426: I do appreciate it, though. How about something to drink? I've got some fine tea today.${prompt}
  7427: Thanks, Ilumida, but I must go. Maybe later I'll have time to visit.${prompt}
  7428: Oh? That's too bad. Well, take care, Wolfgang!${prompt}
  7429: Always at your service, madam.${prompt}
  7430: Wolfgang's father, Brandolf, was a soldier, too. He fought for Jeuno's freedom long before the archduke's reign.${prompt}
  7431: And my husband served under him. But in the wars that followed... When he was about Wolfgang's age...${prompt}
  7432: His father, Brandolf, died from wounds he received in battle. Before he died, he ordered funds to be paid out to people like me.${prompt}
  7433: Well, who am I to lecture about this to a stranger? I'm sorry.${prompt}
  7434: Well, now I suppose I must go give word.${prompt}
  7435: I thought there was a candle around here...${prompt}
  7436: Oh, dear... It seems I'm right out of candles!${prompt}

  7588: But the god Promathia saw this, and condemned her work. He cursed all her people to eternal conflict among each other.${prompt}
  7589: Altana would not be pleased to see us now, squabbling over our petty causes. Please, at least while you are here, shun conflict and pray for peace.${prompt}

  7617: A lot of stubborn people live here, but don't worry, since they're nice once you get to know them.${prompt}
  7618: Behold! Jeuno's residential structure towers above the city! Without it, where would all of Jeuno's visitors stay?${prompt}
  7619: Atop stand Ru'Lude Gardens, the Auroral Palace and the embassies. Great is the awe that place inspires!${prompt}
  7620: You always check the merchandise before you decide what to craft, right?${prompt}
  7621: But in Jeuno, you can buy goods from anywhere, anytime! Me, I always end up checking it all!${prompt}
  7622: The master of this chocobo stable is famous! It is an honor to ride a bird here.${prompt}
  7623: I want to have one of the chocobos for my own, but the master's stubborn! I wonder if he'll ever say yes.${prompt}
  7624: I often forget that we live above the ocean. A long time ago these brrridges were just ruins. I don't know how travelers made it anywhere back then.${prompt}
  7625: But once the brrridges were rebuilt, this town really began to grow. Our ancestors would be proud, I'm sure.${prompt}
  7626: Something has been irking me for quite some time. Would you hear me out?${prompt}
  7627: |-
    Will you listen?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    Not now.${prompt}
  7628: You see, chocobos have wings, do they not? But they cannot fly! So they cannot really be birds, can they?${prompt}
  7629: Everyone thinks about such things before they learn to accept them. But I think it's good to question.${prompt}
  7630: I will be up all night thinking about this!${prompt}
  7631: I haul up cargo from the ships with those cranes, and move it all into the warehouse.${prompt}
  7632: But those cranes just don't cut it anymore. I could sure use at least one more...${prompt}
  7633: It's not easy to see the archduke. But people who have say he's different. Like he's got this...aura...${prompt}
  7634: I wish I could see him. That way, I could find out if it's true!${prompt}
  7635: Long have I hoarded my gil, and the time for purchase is at hand! But shall I buy weaponry or armor?${prompt}
  7636: In offense the best defense may lie, but quickly is the unarmored knight struck down. Hmm... Which to choose...${prompt}

  7680: Nothing about their joy was false. And hearing them was my greatest happiness. But I have forgotten that, and now I cling to the past.${prompt}
  7681: If you were here... If only you were here, I could relive the happiness of those days.${prompt}
  7682: Hello. Head to the counter for service.${prompt}
  7683: I was hired to craft armor for this shop, but all I ever do is watch over the inventory.${prompt}
  7684: I wanted to hone my skills repairing armor. But boy, was I wrong! Armor is never repaired anymore, it's replaced!${prompt}
  7685: Not so with the works of old! No, they were precious, and were often kept for generations.${prompt}

    Do you want to hear about Borghertz?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, tell me.
    No, thank you.${prompt}
  7688: Thirty years ago, the legendary craftsman Borghertz wrought gauntlets, one pair for each job.${prompt}
  7689: So great was his craft, they say he must have sold his spirit to fiends. His gauntlets were strong as steel, but light as a feather!${prompt}
  7690: But, those masterpieces were lost in the great war twenty years ago.${prompt}
  7691: Oh? It seems all adventurers know of him and his gauntlets.${prompt}

  7696: That's about all I know. You can go search that dungeon for yourself if you've got nothing better to do.${prompt}
  7697: We artisans believe that artifacts like the hands of Borghertz still rest in dungeons across Vana'diel. An adventurer like you should be able to find them.${prompt}
  7698: Much is told of Borghertz, but it's all just a legend. Don't let greed cloud your judgment.${prompt}
  7699: Could it be!? Why, they're soiled and rusty, but the craftsmanship! Indeed these are the work of Borghertz!${prompt}
  7700: But they are beyond my skill. I cannot repair them.${prompt}
  7701: Wait. I heard that a Mithra working for the Tenshodo acquired a strange toolbox long ago.${prompt}
  7702: Some mysterious device held it shut; nobody could open it!${prompt}
  7703: Even if it held some magical tool, I doubt anybody has the skill to repair these gauntlets.${prompt}
  7704: You found the gauntlets? Amazing!${prompt}
  7705: So, I have seen the hands of Borghertz. I'm glad I work here now!${prompt}

  7724: Matter of fact, I got something else I wanna ask ya. Just listen, okay?${prompt}
  7725: You know about the war twenty years ago, right? They called up all kinds of animals for duty, and a lot of 'em didn't make it.${prompt}
  7726: 'So, to help calm their spirits, I want you to find three ponds in Fei''Yin. Once there, toss ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} into each one of ''em.${prompt}'

  7734: What, you saw a ghost there? In a place like that?${prompt}
  7735: Oh, yeah... I heard somethin' strange while you were away... Somethin' about the ghost of an Opo-opo in Castle Oztroja.${prompt}
  7736: They say that it doesn't attack, so maybe it was domesticated before it died. As a beastmaster you wanna know more, right?${prompt}
  7737: Maybe it is one that died in the war... I'd be grateful if you could go look into that. I'll have a reward for you when you get back.${prompt}
  7738: Did you know that one of the street performers who used to come here was a beastmaster. Everyone loved his Opo-opo!${prompt}
  7739: Somehow he made his Opo-opo do all kinds of things. I wish I could command this chocobo like that!${prompt}
  7740: Anyway, his Opo-opo loved his spiffy collar. I think that the little bugger was named Tebhi.${prompt}
  7741: 'I heard that ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is hidden somewhere deep inside Castle Oztroja! Huh? You don''t know what that is?${prompt}'
  7742: It's a really nice collar. I bet our chocobos would love to wear one, but maybe that one isn't for chocobos.${prompt}
  7743: So, did that ghost finally go to rest? That's good. Here, I want you to have this.${prompt}
  7744: But I still wonder... What was that Opo-opo spirit doing there?${prompt}

  7748: Not bad if I say so myself. What are you going to use it for?${prompt}
  7749: Looks like the old wounds have healed. War's an awful thing, so we can't let it happen again. The animals would thank us, too.${prompt}
  7750: That street performer must have been a fantastic person! I want to be like him when I grow up!${prompt}

    Donating crystals.
    Conquest points.
    The effects of controlling regions.
    Regions controlled by other nations.
    Regions under beastman control.${prompt}
  7768: All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt}
  7769: Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt}
  7770: Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt}
  7771: So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt}
  7772: |-
    Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.
    They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt}
  7773: Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt}
  7774: Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt}
  7775: |-
    So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.
    We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt}
  7776: |-
    You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.
    Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt}
  7777: |-
    Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.
    The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt}
  7778: |-
    You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  7779: |-
    We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  7780: |-
    You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.
    Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt}
  7781: Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt}
  7782: |-
    You also receive rank points for completing missions.
    Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt}
  7783: |-
    You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.
    Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}
  7784: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt}
  7785: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt}
  7786: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt}
  7787: Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt}
  7788: Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt}
  7789: Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt}
  7790: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt}
  7791: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt}
  7792: |-
    Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.
    If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt}
  7793: If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt}
  7794: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt}
  7795: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt}
  7796: There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt}
  7797: |-
    Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.
    Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.${prompt}

      summer afternoon...it was the little
      things that brought me happiness.${prompt}
  8139: |2-
      As much as I would like to throw away
      everything and spend all my time with
      you, the situation in Vana'diel now
      will not let me.${prompt}
  8140: |2-
      I wish that I could be by your side
      when you read this letter, but that may
      not be what destiny has in store for me.
      I must tell you how I feel now.${prompt}
  8141: "  \n  I love you.\n  ${prompt}"
  8142: |2-
      To this day I regret never saying
      these words to you, and I beg that
      one day you will forgive me.
                                 Adaruel${prompt}
  8143: |-
    The date...
    This is dated the day before he went off to the war...${prompt}
  8144: All that time, he just wanted to say...${prompt}
  8145: My little friend. I think I can understand what you are going through.${prompt}
  8146: |-
    Here.
    Take this chest.${prompt}
  8147: R-really?${prompt}
  8148: Of course. I no longer require it. I have already received its true gift.${prompt}
  8149: If you truly care about this girl, avoid doing things that you will regret later. Women do not care about how fancy the delivery is. If you really mean what you say, she'll know it.${prompt}
  8150: Whether you use that box or not is for you to decide.${prompt}
  8151: Th...thank you. But I think I won't be needing it.${prompt}
  8152: Your story has given me the courage to tell Chululu how I feel. Thank you, Ma'am.${prompt}
  8153: |-
    Oh, ${name-player}. Take this--and some gil--as a reward. I was going to use them to acquire the chest anyway-away.
    Well, I'm off to my shop. Ta-taru!${prompt}
  8154: |-
    Thank you again for all of your help.
    Those words my husband left me still echo in my mind... It is as if he were here in this room, standing with me now...${prompt}
  8155: Our little friend was able to express his feelings to his girlfriend? I knew that he would do the right thing.${prompt}
  8156: I would like to sit down and have a cup of tea with that Chululu. I'm sure we would have a great deal to chat about...${prompt}
  8157: Wow, where did you get all those calluses on your hands?${prompt}
  8158: From practicing with your axe?${prompt}
  8159: That's pretty impressive, but I still don't think you could match my boss over there. He rounded up our chocobos and built this whole stable, all with a single axe.${prompt}
  8160: Why, he could take out the deadliest of monsters with a single swipe!${prompt}
  8161: Osker! Stop your gabbing and get back to work! Our chocobos are starving over there!${prompt}
  8162: I-I'm sorry, boss. I was just admiring this adventurer's hands. They look like they could wield an axe real good.${prompt}
  8163: Look. They've got calluses all over them, just like yours!${prompt}
  8164: |-
    You know, you're right...
    ${name-player}, it looks like you know your axe pretty well. If it isn't too much trouble, I'd like to ask you a favor.${prompt}
  8165: The other day, the leader of that Tenshodo outfit paid us an unexpected visit...${prompt}
  8166: He said he was interested in going into the axe business, but wasn't sure about which one he wanted to sell in his shop. He asked me to test two new models...but I'm busy enough with the stables and don't have any extra time to go out slicing and dicing.${prompt}
  8167: If you're not too busy, would you mind trying one out? You can think of it as polishing your skills.${prompt}
  8168: |-
    How about it?
    ${selection-lines}
    Okay, I'll help you out.
    I'm sorry...${prompt}
  8169: |-
    That's great!
    Here, take her. I already got somebody to try out the other one.${prompt}
  8170: Now go out and test that girl until she's as blunt as a chocobo girl. When you feel the axe has sliced her last slice, bring her back to me and we'll continue from there. Got it?${prompt}
  8171: Yeah, you look like a busy ${choice-player-gender}[man/lady]. Can't expect somebody to help you out when there's nothing in it for them...${prompt}
  8172: When you feel the axe has sliced her last slice, show her to me, and I'll decide if we're to continue or not. Or are you here on other business?${prompt}
  8173: |-
    What do you want?
    ${selection-lines}
    I've lost the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.
    I'm tired of testing the axe.
    Nothing at all.${prompt}
  8174: You've what? Oh well, the Tenshodo guy gave me a box full of these axes, so I could care less if you used 'em to shave your cat's whiskers.${prompt}
  8175: Here, take another one. But you know this means that you're going to have to start all over now, right?${prompt}
  8176: Don't tell me that you're throwing in the towel? C'mon now. I've got a lot of work to do, and there aren't many kind folk out there that would help an old cowboy like me.${prompt}
  8177: |-
    Really throw in the towel?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  8178: I knew you'd come through for me, ${name-player}. Now get out there and get chopping! Take your time if you're busy with your other adventuring.${prompt}
  8179: Boy, you young folk these days have no respect. You give somebody your word, and then you go back on it like it don't mean nothing at all.${prompt}
  8180: I guess I'll just have to find somebody else to help me out. Now take that axe of yours and skedaddle.${prompt}
  8181: I don't know... I don't think I can decide yet. Whack up a few more monsters and then bring her back here for another look.${prompt}
  8182: Well, I'll be! You've worked this axe so hard that I could whack Osker over the head with it and he wouldn't even get a scratch. Now I think I'll be able to decide on which axe I recommend to the Tenshodo.${prompt}
  8183: To tell you the truth, ${name-player}, I didn't think you'd be able to handle the test. I'm really impressed. To show my true gratification, how'd you like to put your axe-wielding skills to a real test?${prompt}
  8184: Back when I was still a blazin' young'un, me and my partners used to compete over who was the strongest of our pack. There was no real meaning to it, but it was fun and helped us build up our confidence on the battlefield.${prompt}
  8185: And after a few of those sessions, I could feel my skills getting more and more refined, until I was smashing through anything that got in my path.${prompt}
  8186: 'Here, take this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} and head to the Temple of Uggalepih. Once you''re there, all you have to do is find ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}. Bring it back to me, and you''re done. Sounds easy, but you''d better go well prepared. I''ve seen more than a few buddies get their hides tanned by the beast that lives in that place.${prompt}'
  8187: 'Take that ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} and head to the Temple of Uggalepih. Once you''re there, find ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} and bring it back to me...but be careful now, hear?${prompt}'
  8188: Ha hah! You dog, you! I can tell by the grin on your face that you kicked that monster in the be-hind!${prompt}
  8189: 'But enough with the small talk! Let''s take a look at that there ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  8190: Whoa! I wish I could be as strong as you and my boss someday! No, someday I will be as strong as you. You just wait and see!${prompt}
  8191: '...I take my hat off to you, ${name-player}.${prompt}'
  8192: As long as there are hard-hittin' white knuckled ${choice-player-gender}[men/ladies] like you out there, Vana'diel won't have to worry about no beastmen or no Shadow Lords.${prompt}
  8193: Now it's time to get back to work. Osker! Stop your dilly-dallying!${prompt}
  8194: More work? I'll never get a chance to practice my axe!${prompt}
  8195: Oh, quit your whining. One of my acquaintances should be here any minute.${prompt}
  8196: Acquaintance? Wow, I didn't think you had any friends, boss.${prompt}
  8197: You just shut your trap, Osker, or I'll glue it shut!${prompt}
  8198: Hello there, Brutus. I've brought back the axe you had me testing. It's a fine piece of work, but the head's a little too heavy for my taste.${prompt}
  8199: Anyway, Brutus, do you remember what day it is today?${prompt}
  8200: What day it is? Of course I do! One look on the calendar over there and...${prompt}
  8201: Don't tell me you forgot that today was the day you'd let me ride my old chocobo?${prompt}
  8202: |-
    Ha ha ha! I had you going there for a while, didn't I? Of course I remember.
    You did a good job with that girl. All the folks over here at the stables rave about how she's been the easiest to work with.${prompt}
  8203: The adventurers do, too! They say she's the most obedient chocobo they've ever ridden.${prompt}
  8204: Heh heh. They didn't say that, did they?${prompt}
  8205: Would I lie to you? You've become one helluva beastmaster, if you ask me.${prompt}
  8206: Her wounds are still not fully healed, but I don't think that a quick ride around the Duchy would hurt. Go on!${prompt}
  8207: Thanks again, Brutus.${prompt}
  8208: But you know...I'm still worried that she won't trust me riding her yet...you know, after all that I put her through...${prompt}
  8209: Are you still fretting over that? Come on, take a look at her eyes.${prompt}
  8210: They're shining as bright as yours, Dietmund.${prompt}
  8211: Brutus...${prompt}
  8212: Hey, hey! You're not going get all sissy on me now, are you!?${prompt}
  8213: I-I-I don't know what t-to say. I think I've g-got something in me eye...${prompt}
  8214: If all you're going to do is stand there and cry, the get the hell out of my stables! You're scaring away business!${prompt}
  8215: Th-thank you, Brutus...${prompt}
  8216: No, thank you, everyone. I'll never forget this day...never...${prompt}
  8217: You have learned the weapon skill “Decimation”!${prompt}
  8218: |-
    See, Dietmund came back, just like I told you. I could tell it from his eyes.
    People ain't that different from chocobos, you know. You can always tell what they're thinking by taking a gander at their baby blues, or blacks, or whatever color they may be.${prompt}
  8219: |-
    It won't be long before this girl goes home to her master...
    But you won't see me crying! Mr. Dietmund promised me that I could ride her whenever I wanted!${prompt}
  8220: The chocobo looks extremely happy.${prompt}
  8221: How is he doing?${prompt}
  8222: Well, there don't seem to be any external wounds. To tell you the truth, I don't exactly know what is wrong with him.${prompt}
  8223: |-
    You don't exactly know?
    So you have some sort of theory?${prompt}
  8224: |-
    ...
    I'm sorry, but I'm not inclined to speak of a patient's condition. Not even to the captain of the Ducal Guard.${prompt}
  8225: |-
    As you wish. But that boy is an important witness. When he comes to, he will be taken in for questioning.
    Has he shown any signs of consciousness?${prompt}
  8226: I'm afraid not...${prompt}
  8227: Wolfgang, what really happened back in that room? What was that device, and what were Jeuno's scientists trying to do with it? You know something, don't you?${prompt}
  8228: You need not worry yourself with the affairs of the Duchy.${prompt}
  8229: |-
    I see... I suppose some things are better left unknown.
    I often ponder over whether to inform a patient when their disease is incurable. However, if there still remains even a thread of hope to cure that disease...${prompt}
  8230: If you are trying to say that Jeuno is ill, you are quite mistaken.${prompt}
  8231: |-
    <Sigh>
    Let me rephrase my question.${prompt}
  8232: Friend to friend, what simply happened that day?${prompt}
  8233: I... I truly do not know. That is why it is crucial we question that boy.${prompt}
  8234: If there is nothing wrong with him, then there is no reason why we cannot move him to the Grand Duke Palace immediately. Monberaux, make the preparations for his transport.${prompt}
  8235: |-
    Ah, it's you...
    As much as I'd like to sit and chat about your adventures over a nice pot of San d'Orian tea, now is not quite the time.${prompt}
  8236: |-
    Wait.
    Perhaps you know something of what took place near the Sea of Shu'Meyo. Recently I have been hearing some strange rumors...${prompt}
  8237: Doctor Monberaux, there is much commotion outside the infirmary. Do you think the Ducal Guards have returned?${prompt}
  8238: Those selfish bastards! Do they think of nothing but their own gain?${prompt}
  8239: I apologize, but there is something I must first take care of.${prompt}
  8240: And we cannot get any answers without the boy awake and in custody! Hand him over! That is an order!${prompt}
  8241: You can order me all you wish, but I will not allow you to wake that boy!${prompt}
  8242: Men, you have your orders.${prompt}
  8243: |-
    Wait, Wolfgang!
    What are you planning on doing to him!? I won't allow you to manhandle my patients like this!${prompt}
  8244: |-
    What is going on!?
    ...!?${prompt}
  8245: 'He... He just vanished!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  8246: 'Don''t just stand there! Seal off the area! I don''t want any man, woman, dog, or cat leaving Upper Jeuno. That boy can''t hide for long.${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  8247: I've seen that child somewhere before...${prompt}
  8248: |-
    I don't understand. No signs of consciousness for hours, and then he just wakes up and runs off...
    There must be an explanation for this...${prompt}
  8249: I'm sorry you had to witness that exchange. I'd like to better inform you of what just happened, but even I'm puzzled by the events that have transpired today.${prompt}
  8250: |-
    Are you all right?
    You look slightly pale.${prompt}
  8251: Well, I hope it is nothing serious.${prompt}
  8252: |-
    That amulet you hold. It belongs to the boy, does it not?
    What's this? You say he gave it to you?${prompt}
  8253: I suggest that you hold on to it. It may give us some clues as to what is really going on. It also may...${prompt}
  8254: '...Never mind.${prompt}'
  8255: |-
    Perhaps I should begin my rounds in the Ru'Lude Gardens. I may be able to collect some valuable information.
    I've a feeling the situation up there may be even tenser than it is here...${prompt}
  8256: |-
    From a medical standpoint, it's a miracle the boy woke up at all.
    I cannot explain it...${prompt}
  8257: Why does Wolfgang need to speak with him so desperately?${prompt}
  8258: Perhaps you should visit the Ru'Lude Gardens. I've a feeling the situation up there may be even tenser than it is here.${prompt}
  8259: An acquaintance of the patient who was just brought in?${prompt}
  8260: That is correct. Where is she!?${prompt}
  8261: Ah, you also know the patient? You may accompany ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8262: However, I must warn you. Her condition is still quite unstable. It seems she is suffering terribly...${prompt}
  8263: Prishe!${prompt}
  8264: Wait, you are...${prompt}
  8265: Do you two know each other? This noble warrior is the one who brought in our unconscious princess.${prompt}
  8266: Sir Tenzen...the adventurer, ${name-player}, also seems to be acquainted with the patient.${prompt}
  8267: |-
    Prishe...
    What ill fate has befallen you...?${prompt}
  8268: '...Keeper...${prompt}'
  8269: Prishe?${prompt}
  8270: '...of the...Apocalypse...${prompt}'
  8271: Keeper of the Apocalypse? Of what are you speaking?${prompt}
  8272: '!?${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  8273: |-
    Calling...me...
    ...Stop!
    ...Get away!${prompt}
  8274: N-no...!
  8275: Her amulet! It is gone!${prompt}
  8276: You! Did you not see an amulet about my dear friend's neck? Without it, she...${prompt}
  8277: I apologize, miss, but by the time I had found her, she was without this amulet of which you speak.${prompt}
  8278: Impossible...${prompt}
  8279: Wait! ${name-player}, would you show me your amulet?${prompt}
  8280: |-
    I feel that the two may be connected in some way.
    Please! It may be the only way we can save Prishe!${prompt}
  8281: |-
    The patient's condition has stabilized. However, she shows no signs of awakening from the deep sleep into which she has fallen.
    In all my years as a doctor, I have never seen anything like this...${prompt}
  8282: ${name-player}, do you truly feel that this all has some connection to that amulet?${prompt}
  8283: If only the mysterious boy who dropped it were still here, he might help us shed some light onto the predicament in which we find ourselves...${prompt}
  8284: Boy...? You do not mean the same boy whom the Ducal Guard is searching for, do you?${prompt}
  8285: What is this? Have you also heard the rumors of the strange young man who disappeared days ago?${prompt}
  8286: While visiting the palace, I was told of a certain dangerous boy.${prompt}
  8287: |-
    I see...
    So this boy carried with him an amulet similar to that of the girl. This could be why she was attacked...${prompt}
  8288: But, Prishe's amulet was given to her by Cardinal Mildaurion. It is preposterous to think that the cardinal could be associated with any criminals!${prompt}
  8289: Cardinal Mildaurion of the Tavnazian Cathedral?${prompt}
  8290: Yes. Long ago, the cardinal gave the amulet to Prishe after she had been badly injured in an accident. She said it was to protect her.${prompt}
  8291: |-
    Ever since that day, she has not been without the amulet.
    But why would anyone wish to steal it...?${prompt}
  8292: Perhaps it was the boy who stole the patient's amulet. However, just days ago I heard that the boy was recently spotted in the ruins of Pso'Xja, located deep within the dreaded Northlands.${prompt}
  8293: What!? Are you positive!?${prompt}
  8294: A soldier I treated for hypothermia mentioned that his party had seen him alone in the ruins. When the Ducal Guard learned of this, they set out for the Northlands at once.${prompt}
  8295: |-
    So the fourth crystal lies in the ruins of Pso'Xja...
    I have no time to lose.${prompt}
  8296: Wait!${prompt}
  8297: Before you set off on your journey, I must inform you that the ruins are controlled by an organization known as the Tenshodo. You should probably consult with them first.${prompt}
  8298: |-
    I see...
    Thank you for this information.
    Good day, Doctor!${prompt}
  8299: I wonder if there might be some connection between the boy and that young lady, Prishe.${prompt}
  8300: According to the rumors among the Ducal Guard, someone saw him in the central tower of the northern ruins of Pso'Xja. However, to enter the deeper parts of those towers, permission from Tenshodo is necessary...${prompt}
  8301: You say you know the Elvaan girl who collapsed here?${prompt}
  8302: |-
    A strangely-dressed traveler from the East carried her off to Doctor Monberaux's clinic.
    Oh, I do hope she is alright.${prompt}
  8303: Unlike the unsavory rumors that have been spreading through the Duchy streets, the Elvaan girl who collapsed here was not attacked by some shady assailant.${prompt}
  8304: While she was kneeling before the statue of the Goddess to offer a prayer, she suddenly crumpled to the floor and began convulsing violently. I attempted to cleanse her soul of the terrible demons that possessed her; however, my holy water had no effect.${prompt}
  8305: I can only hope my prayers for her safety reach the Goddess swiftly.${prompt}
  8306: |-
    ...
    I-I apologize. I have not been myself since the Elvaan girl had her...accident.${prompt}
  8307: I know that Mother Chiphraix insists that no foul play was involved, but I could swear that I sensed a dark presence behind the girl before she collapsed.${prompt}
  8308: And now every time I think of it, I become light-headed and dizzy...${prompt}
  8309: If you're here to see the girl, she's been awake for the past few hours.${prompt}
  8310: What do you think you're talking about!? There's no way that the cardinal would...${prompt}
  8311: I know, but even if she did, I am positive there is a reasonable explanation.${prompt}
  8312: Oh, ${name-player}. I cannot begin to express my gratitude for you saving Prishe.${prompt}
  8313: She has informed me of what transpired that day.${prompt}
  8314: Possessed by an unknown beast within her own dream...${prompt}
  8315: You and Tenzen were able to bring her back. However, we still do not know what has become of the amulet she carried.${prompt}
  8316: I sense that the goings-on of the past few days are but the tip of the iceberg.${prompt}
  8317: ${name-player}, is there anything more you can tell us?${prompt}
  8318: That is the question we should be asking you!${prompt}
  8319: What are your connections with this criminal that I, the Duchy, and ${name-player} are searching for?${prompt}
  8320: The boy who has constantly eluded the Ducal Guard--where is he hiding?${prompt}
  8321: Prishe, you must answer me. Why was that boy with you, and where has he disappeared to!?${prompt}
  8322: |-
    Hell if I know...
    But there is one thing that I can say: I don't care if he's on the top of Jeuno's most wanted list. If it weren't for him saving my butt, I'd be pushing up lilacs in the necropolis.${prompt}
  8323: Anyway, it's not the boy I'm worried about. What are you going to do about that monster in my dream!? You said you knew what it was, right?${prompt}
  8324: Come on! Spill it, old man! Why is that thing after me!?${prompt}
  8325: Diabolos... Terrestrial avatar of dreams...${prompt}
  8326: Terrestrial avatar...?${prompt}
  8327: The terrestrial avatars are the five powerful gods born of Vana'diel and entrusted to protect her.${prompt}
  8328: Many eons ago, the five avatars fought a fierce battle with an evil presence that attempted to envelop and suffocate our world.${prompt}
  8329: There is the fiery bird of resurrection, Phoenix, whom the blade I carry at my side has been blessed by.${prompt}
  8330: And then there is the ruler of dreams, Diabolos; the guardian of the moon, Fenrir; the bringer of rainbows, Carbuncle; and the conqueror of the skies, Bahamut...${prompt}
  8331: Ba-Bahamut!?${prompt}
  8332: |-
    You have heard of the legend of Bahamut?
    It just so happens that I have traveled across many malms of ocean to this continent in order to meet Bahamut--and request his assistance in stopping the Keeper of the Apocalypse.${prompt}
  8333: '!!!${prompt}'
  8334: Now that you mention it, when I went to Cape Riverne, I do remember Bahamut saying something about a keeper of some sorts...${prompt}
  8335: Keeper of the Apocalypse... Prishe! Those are the words you spoke while you were unconscious!${prompt}
  8336: |-
    All I remember is that before you guys arrived, that monster Diabolos talked about a song that sang of the keeper.
    What was it called...? “Memoria de la S^tona”?${prompt}
  8337: The memory of the crystal...${prompt}
  8338: He also said that when the keeper arrives, “our pact will be fulfilled.” Whatever that means...${prompt}
  8339: And that's why he told me to see Bahamut as soon as possible...${prompt}
  8340: |-
    “Our pact”...
    What could he have meant...?${prompt}
  8341: Beats me, and I don't plan on going back there to ask him.${prompt}
  8342: But I have a feeling that Bahamut could fill us in on the details. That's why we've got to get back to Tavnazia!${prompt}
  8343: Back to Tavnazia? You mean to tell me that you have come from the Marquisate?${prompt}
  8344: That is correct. However, we were teleported here by Bahamut when we tried to speak with him...${prompt}
  8345: What an excellent turn of events!${prompt}
  8346: It just so happens that I have requested transport to Tavnazia from the leader of the Tenshodo, Aldo. If it is possible, I would like you two to join me and help me find Bahamut!${prompt}
  8347: So you're the guy Aldo was talking about...${prompt}
  8348: Well, I guess the more the merrier, right? We'll meet you at the Tenshodo when you're ready to go.${prompt}
  8349: Understood!${prompt}
  8350: Oh, and you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8351: I'll be holding on to this amulet for just a little while longer. You got a problem with that?${prompt}
  8352: Hey, and when you're finished with your business here, why don't you come back to Tavnazia? You know the way, right?${prompt}
  8353: See ya around!${prompt}
  8354: 'You lend the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to Prishe.${prompt}'
  8355: |-
    I'm delighted to see my young patient fully recovered.
    She's awfully energetic when conscious, isn't she?${prompt}
  8356: |-
    It appears our visitors have returned to Tavnazia.
    I admit being most surprised to hear the nation still existed.${prompt}
  8357: ${name-player}, it seems as if you have experienced a trying ordeal in the Northlands.${prompt}
  8358: I have attempted to gather information from the Ducal Guard; however, none are willing--or should I say allowed--to speak of the matter, though the fear in their eyes tells much.${prompt}
  8359: |-
    And that is not all...
    Recently there have been unsettling rumors that the end of the world is near.${prompt}
  8360: Those rumors also say that the young patient that I treated--the girl who had her amulet stolen--is connected with all this in some matter.${prompt}
  8361: I have even heard that the Ducal Guard has a warrant out for her arrest...${prompt}
  8362: Preposterous! Lady Prishe is simply being used. The true criminal is that boy!${prompt}
  8363: Why, if it is not...${prompt}
  8364: I apologize for my sudden entrance, Doctor.${prompt}
  8365: |-
    ${name-player}!
    Something terrible is underway!${prompt}
  8366: I have come from the Grand Duke Palace, where I heard of the Duchy's ridiculous plan. Jeuno has begun to mobilize the Ducal Guard in preparation for an attack on...Bahamut!${prompt}
  8367: Yes, Bahamut has threatened Vana'diel with the promise of apocalypse. However, he is still one of the terrestrial avatars bound to protect our world.${prompt}
  8368: There must be some way to persuade the conqueror of the skies...and that is why I requested to accompany the commander of this operation, Lady Esha'ntarl. Unfortunately...${prompt}
  8369: '...the commander was not one to listen to reason. She is convinced that it would be futile to try and communicate with Bahamut, and the only way to save the people of Vana''diel is to attack the Wyrmking and his minions before they attack our cities.${prompt}'
  8370: Excuse me, sir. I am not sure if I fully comprehend what you are trying to say.${prompt}
  8371: Bahamut is readying to launch an attack on the four nations? That cannot be true!${prompt}
  8372: But if it was...${prompt}
  8373: Have the leaders of the nations been informed? Have their armies begun preparations?${prompt}
  8374: Unfortunately, San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst more than likely remain oblivious to the situation at hand. And even if they did know, they would have no means of mounting a counterattack.${prompt}
  8375: Bahamut is known as the conqueror of the skies for a reason. The power he and his minions possess is beyond anything we could imagine--the power to control time and space.${prompt}
  8376: Control time and space...?${prompt}
  8377: The moment he and his minions were to arrive above our cities would be the moment of our defeat. We would have no choice but to accept annihilation...${prompt}
  8378: '...${prompt}'
  8379: But I feel there is still a way...${prompt}
  8380: Lady Esha'ntarl mentioned that Bahamut is currently building up the energy necessary for teleporting his fellow wyrms to the locations of attack.${prompt}
  8381: If we could reach Bahamut before he has stored enough power, we may be able to persuade him not to begin his ambush of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  8382: Persuade him? The end of the world is right before us, and you want to sit down and chat with the bringer of that destruction!?${prompt}
  8383: |-
    Exactly!
    With the Phoenix Blade and ${name-player} by my side, I am positive that I can convince Bahamut to spare the lives of those on this world.${prompt}
  8384: But to succeed, I require your assistance, Doctor.${prompt}
  8385: I need to know where that boy was first discovered!${prompt}
  8386: '...!${prompt}'
  8387: |-
    ...
    Understood.
    Wolfgang, captain of the Ducal Guard, ordered me not to reveal this information to anyone...however, I am afraid I no longer have any choice.${prompt}
  8388: On the first floor of Delkfutt's Tower, there is a large doorway that leads into the deeper areas of the spire.${prompt}
  8389: It is somewhere down there that the boy mysteriously appeared. A large, central chamber...but that is all I remember.${prompt}
  8390: |-
    I am extremely grateful for all you have done for us, Doctor.
    Come, ${name-player}, we have no time to lose.${prompt}
  8391: Ah, but there is a door--a locked door, and only Wolfgang knows how to open it.${prompt}
  8392: I have no worries, as Phoenix will lead the way.${prompt}
  8393: ${name-player}, make your preparations quickly and meet me at the tower.${prompt}
  8394: ${name-player}, it may be a worthless effort, but let me ask Wolfgang for the key to that chamber.${prompt}
  8395: While sometimes misled, he is a man who strongly believes in justice. He may feel that it is solely his duty to protect the world on the eve of its destruction.${prompt}
  8396: |-
    We must let him know that there are those of us who also follow the same path as he.
    Here. Take this envelope to the palace guard post. I will be praying for your success, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8397: |-
    The boy first appeared in Delkfutt's Tower.
    On the first floor of the tower, there is a large doorway that leads into the deeper areas of the structure...${prompt}
  8398: |-
    Wolfgang will know how to open the door that lies beyond.
    Take this envelope to the palace guard post. I will be praying for your success, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8399: I see by his reaction that Wolfgang understood the meaning of the map.${prompt}
  8400: |-
    Where should you go? Hah hah. That's a secret, ${name-player}.
    Though, if you think hard enough, I feel you will come to understand.${prompt}
  8401: |-
    I knew all along Wolfgang would come. He is a good man, despite being a little stubborn.
    Now hurry to Delkfutt's Tower. Tenzen should already be on his way.${prompt}
  8402: Somewhere on the first floor there is a large doorway that leads to the basement of the tower. The key you received from Wolfgang will open that door.${prompt}
  8403: Wolfgang should not be giving you any more problems. I think he has finally started to realize what is truly important in this world.${prompt}
  8404: |-
    Have you heard the rumors?
    Some are saying that the end of the world is upon us.${prompt}
  8405: Thanks to that, we here at the clinic have lately been spending more time mending people's spirits than their broken bones.${prompt}
  8406: ${name-player}, it is good to see you.${prompt}
  8407: We have finally grasped the entire tapestry that our separate tales have woven.${prompt}
  8408: I never believed that something like this was possible.${prompt}
  8409: I suggest you prepare yourself before Lady Ulmia arrives.${prompt}
  8410: Why is everyone so quiet? Is something wrong?${prompt}
  8411: |-
    Lady Ulmia, we have been waiting for you.
    Will you steel your heart and listen to the story we have to tell?${prompt}
  8412: Of course, we have tried to refute this conclusion and find some other explanation.${prompt}
  8413: However, we now know that the boy, Selh'teus, has come to thwart the plans of the ancient ones and steal the light of the crystals.${prompt}
  8414: We also know that the Divinity of Darkness that rules over the Kindred was not Promathia after all.${prompt}
  8415: But...the Moblins...heard from...the Divinity of Darkness...that the...Keeper of the Apocalypse...has already...arisen.${prompt}
  8416: And surely you have seen the magicite imbedded in Prishe's chest?${prompt}
  8417: According to your explanation, that stone contained the Emptiness of the Twilight God, Promathia.${prompt}
  8418: |-
    Lady Ulmia.
    This must come as a shock for one so close to Lady Prishe.${prompt}
  8419: But I must inform you of the facts I have learned from the terrestrial avatars Carbuncle and Fenrir.${prompt}
  8420: After ten thousand years, the Keeper of the Apocalypse was fated to be born in the nation of Tavnazia!${prompt}
  8421: Surely you are not saying that this keeper you speak of is Prishe!${prompt}
  8422: |-
    That is impossible!
    I refuse to believe it!${prompt}
  8423: We have been friends since the time before Tavnazia's destruction!${prompt}
  8424: I can honestly say that I have never met a person more pure of heart.${prompt}
  8425: She has more faith, and more courage...${prompt}
  8426: How could she be the Keeper of the Apocalypse and still urge Diabolos to save the world?${prompt}
  8427: It is true that I do not know of anyone who possesses the zest for life that Prishe has.${prompt}
  8428: And if we had but the time and the knowledge, we would rescue Lady Prishe from this destiny.${prompt}
  8429: However, we have no time remaining.${prompt}
  8430: |-
    A duty lies before us:
    Lord Bahamut and his minions must be stopped!${prompt}
  8431: And if Cardinal Mildaurion is still alive as we believe, she will be planning to use Prishe to awaken the Twilight God.${prompt}
  8432: With Prishe and her magicite in the cardinal's possession, the world is one step away from oblivion!${prompt}
  8433: When Promathia...awakens...there will be...no stopping...the Moblins.${prompt}
  8434: |-
    Stop it, all of you.
    You truly intend to do away with Prishe if it means the plans of Wyrmking Bahamut will be prevented?${prompt}
  8435: That is something I cannot do!${prompt}
  8436: Lady Ulmia!${prompt}
  8437: '...${prompt}'
  8438: |-
    Let her be.
    The first thing we have to do is rrrescue Prishe from the Grand Duke Palace.
    I'll start working on a plan.${prompt}
  8439: |-
    I will call upon some old acquaintances.
    They may be able to help us.${prompt}
  8440: |-
    I wish...no more lives...to be lost.
    I...will do...what I can.${prompt}
  8441: ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8442: Do you agree with our decision?${prompt}
  8443: |-
    Do you agree?
    ${selection-lines}
    No, I don't.
    There's no other way.
    What decision?${prompt}
  8444: Do not let our actions concern you.${prompt}
  8445: You are free to follow your own path from here.${prompt}
  8446: |-
    I only ask that you look after Lady Ulmia.
    She did not take this news well.${prompt}
  8447: There is little you can say to comfort her, but at least see her safely to Tavnazia.${prompt}
  8448: If you ask the aid of Lady Esha'ntarl, I am sure your return will be a swift one.${prompt}
  8449: Until we meet again!${prompt}
  8450: |-
    You understand what we have all agreed to here?
    We have come to a brutal and bloody conclusion.${prompt}
  8451: Although no one life holds more importance than another, I have a duty to save the world, no matter the cost.${prompt}
  8452: |-
    But still...
    I worry for Lady Ulmia.${prompt}
  8453: In order to save the world from destruction, we must defeat the one known as the Keeper of the Apocalypse.${prompt}
  8454: Even if Lady Prishe herself is the Keeper, I will not fail to carry out this task.${prompt}
  8455: |-
    A beautiful lady justaru ran that way, tears streaming down her face.
    I've never seen anything like it.${prompt}
  8456: |-
    Today is Tarutaru day at the pub, and she was an Elvaan.
    I can understand how that'd make you want to cry.${prompt}
  8457: I am glad to see that you have all survived unscathed.${prompt}
  8458: You...!${prompt}
  8459: You are...the priest...!?${prompt}
  8460: Nice to see you both again after so long.${prompt}
  8461: |-
    It's been twenty years since I've seen you, Shikaree Z.
    And a hundred years for you, Jabbos, if I'm not mistaken.${prompt}
  8462: And you, the man of extraordinary luck.${prompt}
  8463: I am most delighted to be in your presence once more, Cardinal Mildaurion.${prompt}
  8464: I would love to celebrate this long overdue reunion; however, now is not the time.${prompt}
  8465: Lord Bahamut has revealed to us an unsettling truth--the Keeper of the Apocalypse waits in the celestial capital of Al'Taieu.${prompt}
  8466: Until now, the Armathrwn Society had believed the city of Al'Taieu destroyed.${prompt}
  8467: Judging by the counsel of the terrestrial avatars and the memories of Selh'teus, however, we can assume that the celestial capital still exists.${prompt}
  8468: |-
    The society is now focused on gaining further information.
    To this end, the objective of our next operation is to capture--not kill--Lord Bahamut.${prompt}
  8469: I, Esha'ntarl, will join the main fleet of warships and head once more to the ends of the earth.${prompt}
  8470: But there is another important matter that requires our immediate attention--a matter involving the fifth mothercrystal.${prompt}
  8471: Someone has apparently severed the fifth crystal from the Crystal Line.${prompt}
  8472: When the boy, Selh'teus, appeared, was not this Crystal Line the conduit he traversed with Lord Bahamut?${prompt}
  8473: |-
    Just a damn moment!
    So now we can't use this pipeline gizmo to get to the fifth mothercrystal!?${prompt}
  8474: How are we supposed to get to Al'Taieu and wipe the floor with the Keeper of the Apocalypse!?${prompt}
  8475: |-
    How, indeed.
    In any event, we must search for an alternative route now that Phoenix is no longer with us.${prompt}
  8476: |-
    Wait.
    Mildaurion, you mentioned that “someone” isolated the fifth mothercrystal?${prompt}
  8477: Who is rrresponsible for this act of sabotage?${prompt}
  8478: |-
    I do not know.
    The only people capable of such a feat would be either Selh'teus, or Nag'molada...${prompt}
  8479: I currently have Jeunoan troops preparing to invade Movalpolos.${prompt}
  8480: M...Movalpolos...!?${prompt}
  8481: |-
    The Moblins...are in danger...!?
    I must...leave...immediately!${prompt}
  8482: Jabbos has spent a century living with the Moblins in an effort to avert this sort of development.${prompt}
  8483: This is most worrisome. I shall follow him and see he does not come to harm.${prompt}
  8484: I will accompany you!${prompt}
  8485: I realize that Jabbos has tried for years to convince the Moblins that they are not the children of Promathia.${prompt}
  8486: But for the sake of the mothercrystal, the Moblins cannot be left to their own devices.${prompt}
  8487: If he fails to persuade them otherwise, they may attempt to destroy the fifth crystal.${prompt}
  8488: Destroy the crystal!?${prompt}
  8489: The mothercrystal is at both the beginning and the end of a person's journey in this life.${prompt}
  8490: After learning this fact from Jabbos, the Moblins now believe that destroying the mothercrystal will spell the end for the children of Altana.${prompt}
  8491: How could Jabbos fail to mention something so important!?${prompt}
  8492: |-
    He had no choice.
    If that kinda thing became public knowledge, Movalpolos would be gutted and all the Moblins slaughtered.${prompt}
  8493: '!${prompt}'
  8494: |-
    Miss Mildaurion.
    I'm not in a position to be giving advice to a ten thousand-year-old, but just hear me out.${prompt}
  8495: Killing every last Moblin might make this mess all nice and neat, but it's not what I'd call a solution.${prompt}
  8496: Isn't this the exact same thing that Bahamut is trying to do?${prompt}
  8497: '...${prompt}'
  8498: |-
    You are right...
    Nothing good can come of this...${prompt}
  8499: I will plead with the Armathrwn Society to find a peaceable solution to this problem.${prompt}
  8500: Thanks, Miss Mildaurion!${prompt}
  8501: But from this point onward I will be joining the society to monitor its actions.${prompt}
  8502: |-
    My movements will be limited, but rest assured that I will be watching over you always.
    Now go, my brave companions. The fate of the world and her people is in your hands.${prompt}
  8503: |-
    Alrighty!
    Ulmia, Tenzen, ${name-player}!
    On to Movalpolos!${prompt}
  8504: Everyone who wants to scrap it out for the ultimate victory, follow me!!!${prompt}
  8505: I hear this pub is sometimes reserved by the head of the Tenshodo.${prompt}
  8506: |-
    Not a momentaru ago, there were Mithra and Galka and all sorts filing out the door.
    They were saying something about going to Movalpolos.${prompt}
  8507: |-
    Are they thinking of bringing their beastmen buddies back here?
    Next thing you know, they'll be having “Goblin's Day.”${prompt}
  8508: You must indeed be serious about your beliefs to choose the Temple of the Goddess over the bustling sights and sounds of Jeuno.${prompt}
  8509: In my long years I have come to discover that a person serious about ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] beliefs is a person who can be trusted with a serious task.${prompt}
  8510: Are you willing to hear my request?${prompt}
  8511: |-
    Listen to his request?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'll listen.
    I come here for the peace and quiet.${prompt}
  8512: "Thank you, adventurer. \nPerhaps you have heard of the ruins of Pso'Xja, that are found on the Beaucedine Glacier?${prompt}"
  8513: It is whispered that those ruins are deeply entwined with the history of the ancients.${prompt}
  8514: When thieves discovered the mysterious structures in later years, they were quick to put up iron grates at the tower entrances and carry away the relics within.${prompt}
  8515: However, they were never able to open the decorated gate that lies in the deepest part of the ruins. The thieves searched for a way to open this portal for many years.${prompt}
  8516: |-
    Only recently did they finally stumble across the key to the gate.
    What they found inside apparently did not live up to their expectations.${prompt}
  8517: Believing that they had claimed all the treasures to be found, the Tenshodo opened almost every area of the six towers to adventurers.${prompt}
  8518: |-
    I do not agree with the Tenshodo's appraisal of their final discovery.
    The magical device that was hidden behind that gate closely resembles those that exist in the towers of Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  8519: Would this not mean that the towers of Pso'Xja have a similar function to the Sarutabaruta ruins?${prompt}
  8520: I have had adventurers who share your level of integrity delve into the ruins several times to investigate this possibility.${prompt}
  8521: |-
    I do not think the Tenshodo has given the matter due consideration.
    A magical device was found on the other side of that gate.${prompt}
  8522: No one knows the purpose behind the towers' construction, and it is far too dangerous to allow the general population access to the ruins without further research.${prompt}
  8523: And that is why I decided to ask adventurers who share your level of integrity to place a seal upon that gate.${prompt}
  8524: |-
    The only problem is, not one adventurer has been able to reach it.
    There are two other gates that block the path to the deepest section of the southwest tower.${prompt}
  8525: Will you attempt to find a way into the southwest tower's heart?${prompt}
  8526: |-
    Will you go?
    ${selection-lines}
    I will.
    I don't think so.${prompt}
  8527: |-
    You will be able to open the final gate with this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.
    It should also activate the magical device that lies beyond.${prompt}
  8528: |-
    Once the device is activated, return here for your reward.
    I pray for your success.${prompt}
  8529: |-
    Seal the final gate using this ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.
    I pray for your success.${prompt}
  8530: |-
    Find a way into the deepest section of the southwest tower, and activate the device that lies beyond the final gate.
    Both the gate and the device should respond to the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
  8531: |-
    Find a way into the deepest section of the southwest tower, and seal the final gate with the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.
    I pray for your success.${prompt}
  8532: |-
    That was too close...
    Thankfully, the device was activated before those meddling scholars from Windurst arrived.${prompt}
  8533: |-
    But my work is not done.
    I must find a way to seal the device so that no one can stop it...${prompt}
  8534: |-
    You have my thanks.
    It appears the obstructions within the tower did not prevent you from activating the device.${prompt}
  8535: |-
    The devices within the other towers are also being activated, one by one.
    Please accept your reward.${prompt}
  8536: |-
    You have my thanks.
    It appears the obstructions within the tower did not prevent you from sealing the gate.${prompt}
  8537: |-
    Do not be concerned; the gates within the other towers are being sealed as we speak.
    Please accept your reward.${prompt}
  8538: |-
    Ah, the gate did not open for you?
    That is because a more experienced adventurer activated the device before you arrived.${prompt}
  8539: |-
    However, I still wish to recognize your sincere desire to carry out my request.
    Please accept this token of my appreciation.${prompt}
  8540: |-
    What would happen should all of the devices be activated?
    I really couldn't say.${prompt}
  8541: |-
    However, I am assured that...
    Ah...never mind.${prompt}
  8542: |-
    However, how am I to seal...?
    Ah...never mind.${prompt}

  8602: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  8603: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  8604: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  8605: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  8606: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  8607: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  8608: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  8609: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  8610: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  8611: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  8612: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  8613: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  8614: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  8615: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  8616: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  8617: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  8618: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  8619: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  8620: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  8621: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  8622: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  8623: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  8624: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'
  8625: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt}
  8626: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  8627: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  8628: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
  8629: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}
  8630: I was thinking this out loud when an Elvaan girl passing by stopped to talk to me.${prompt}
  8631: |-
    But what about moogles? They've got wings, and they can fly, but you wouldn't call 'em birds.
    They've got those funny antennae, too, but they're not insects, either.${prompt}

  8633: Then what's the difference between animals and people?${prompt}
  8634: |-
    I answered, “People are smarter than animals.”
    And then she retorted, “People sure are more sly!”${prompt}
  8635: |-
    Ahahaha, don't get all huffy on me!
    I stopped to talk because what you were saying was important.${prompt}

    That Elvaan girl told me that both people and animals have souls.
    She said that the souls of animals are far more pure than those of people.${prompt}
  8649: She also told me I would understand what she meant if I found out how that chocobo was born.${prompt}
  8650: |-
    According to Shalott, the chocobo's mother is from the stables in Bastok.

    What can I do for you?
    If you want to ride a chocobo, one of the girls over there can help you out.${prompt}
  8652: Lately, a lot of adventurers seem to be forgetting that a chocobo is an animal, not an object.${prompt}

    You should keep that in mind as you're enjoying that easy ride through monster-ridden badlands.
    Have a safe journey.${prompt}
  8654: A chocobo with silver-colored feathers...?${prompt}
  8655: Ah, you'd be talking about Silver Comet.${prompt}
  8656: She used to be the mount of a highly ranked general in the Bastokan navy.${prompt}
  8657: The general's son received the chocobo as a coming-of-age present, which he promptly took advantage of to leave Bastok.${prompt}
  8658: For the longest time, no one saw hide nor hair of man or beast--until eventually, Silver Comet came wandering back into town...alone.${prompt}
  8659: I heard later on that the general's son had lost his life somewhere in the wilds.${prompt}
  8660: Only Silver Comet had managed to return unharmed.${prompt}
  8661: In memory of his son, the general asked us to take the chocobo into our care...${prompt}

    But then one day, Silver Comet was gone.
    Some chocobo thief had stolen her.${prompt}
  8663: |-
    Hm?
    You say a chick of Silver Comet's is being kept in the Jeuno stables?
    You must be mistaken.${prompt}
  8664: Anyway, after the theft, the general exhausted every avenue in search of his son's chocobo.${prompt}
  8665: He eventually found an adventurer who allegedly saw a chocobo drowning in the Pashhow Marshlands.${prompt}
  8666: That chocobo had the same markings as Silver Comet.${prompt}
  8667: If you want to try talking to that adventurer, you should go to the outpost in the marshlands.${prompt}

    It's good for hiding a person's scent, you see.

  8680: |-
    Now, then.
    You wanted to hear about that chocobo, right?${prompt}
  8681: |-
    She was one of the fastest chocobos I've ever ridden, but damn near uncontrollable.
    I don't know how Silver Comet's owner handled her.${prompt}
  8682: |-
    I guess the death of her former owner is what sent her off the edge.
    That chocobo wasn't right in the head.${prompt}
  8683: |-
    She threw herself headlong into the marshes.
    Thought my number was up, I can tell you!
  8684: When I saw her in the stables, she was wearing a collar attached to a chain.${prompt}
  8685: That wasn't to keep the general's mount from being stolen--it was to keep Silver Comet from flying the coop, so to speak.${prompt}
  8686: |-
    That general's a real schemer.
    Said that if Silver Comet was released, she would be able to find Shooting Star.${prompt}
  8687: It's his fault I almost got killed!${prompt}
  8688: |-
    Huh?
    Who's Shooting Star? He's a chocobo, too.${prompt}
  8689: Shooting Star was Silver Comet's mate.${prompt}
  8690: Their love was a pure, uncomplicated thing, much more so than what people feel.${prompt}
  8691: |-
    Ahahaha!
    I think this oil is starting to muddle my senses.
    I'll see you around, adventurer.${prompt}
  8692: Were you able to meet with that adventurer?${prompt}
  8693: |-
    ...Is that right?
    I think you were around that ${item-singular: 1[2]} a bit too long.${prompt}
  8694: It sounds to me like that adventurer was the one who stole Silver Comet in the first place.${prompt}
  8695: Or at least you would think so, if the thief wasn't supposed to have drowned in the marsh as well.${prompt}
  8696: |-
    You mentioned a “Shooting Star”?
    I know that name.${prompt}
  8697: |-
    That chocobo was raised alongside Silver Comet.
    Those two were almost inseparable as chicks.${prompt}
  8698: Unfortunately, unlike Silver Comet's case, Shooting Star died saving his master.${prompt}
  8699: |-
    I'm guessing Silver Comet was trying to find him when she jumped into that marsh.
    The general mentioned something similar at the time, I recall.${prompt}
  8700: |-
    Hm?
    Still trying to convince me that her chick is in Jeuno?${prompt}
  8701: |-
    I'm sorry, but I really think you're mistaken.
    I mean, the general even had Silver Comet's collar.${prompt}
  8702: He said he was going to lay it on his son's grave in Batallia Downs.${prompt}
  8703: |-
    But, wait.
    I seem to remember that collar being sent by a man named Brutus.
    He runs a chocobo stable in Jeuno...${prompt}
  8704: Why would the collar be sent from Jeuno when Silver Comet drowned in the Pashhow Marshlands?${prompt}
  8705: You are being attacked!${prompt}
  8706: Now is not the time for that!${prompt}
  8707: You sense something is not quite right...${prompt}
  8708: You find nothing.${prompt}
  8709: I...I don't know what you're talking about.${prompt}
  8710: |-
    Wow...
    So this collar belonged to that chocobo's mother, Silver Comet?${prompt}
  8711: I would place this on the grave of her mate, Shooting Star, if I only knew where it was.${prompt}
  8712: So you're the two snoopers who were asking Shalott about Silver Comet.${prompt}
  8713: That collar...!?${prompt}
  8714: |-
    You've dug pretty far into this old story.
    Looks like after twenty years, people start to let things slip.${prompt}
  8715: Please don't be angry, Brutus.${prompt}
  8716: I found out that chocobos can fall in love, just like people do.${prompt}
  8717: There was a girl who taught me that animals and people are the same.${prompt}
  8718: I think the story of Silver Comet and Shooting Star helped me to really understand what she meant.${prompt}
  8719: Well then, I suppose I'll have to tell you the whole tale.${prompt}
  8720: Silver Comet and Shooting Star never really died.${prompt}
  8721: Really!?${prompt}
  8722: Shooting Star was a special chocobo that was attacked by an evil man.${prompt}
  8723: He was badly wounded when they brought him here, and we all worked hard to get him back on his feet.${prompt}
  8724: But Shooting Star was still being chased by the evil man, so we had to hide him away.${prompt}
  8725: We took him to a place in the west of Batallia Downs, where that villain would never find him.${prompt}
  8726: But the bad man was clever. He knew that if he had Silver Comet, her bond to Shooting Star would lead them right to the chocobo's hiding place.${prompt}
  8727: Silver Comet was one smart chocobo, though.${prompt}
  8728: She deliberately dove into the marshes to force the villain from her back.${prompt}
  8729: It was an extremely dangerous thing for Silver Comet to do.${prompt}
  8730: |-
    But she never gave up.
    She had to protect her mate from the man who meant to hurt him.${prompt}
  8731: |-
    Silver Comet swam through the muck and dragged herself free of the marshlands.
    She was finally able to make it to Shooting Star's side.${prompt}
  8732: That's when I took off her collar and set her free.${prompt}
  8733: What happened to them after that?${prompt}
  8734: Did they live happily ever after?${prompt}
  8735: |-
    That's right.
    And the youngest of the brood they raised together is that chocobo right over there.${prompt}
  8736: What a great story...${prompt}
  8737: |-
    It's not over yet.
    The villain of this tale is still lurking around somewhere.${prompt}
  8738: "That's why you can never tell anybody what you've heard here today. \nYou want to keep that chocobo safe, right?${prompt}"
  8739: Right!${prompt}
  8740: I'll never tell, I promise!${prompt}
  8741: |-
    Glad to hear it.
    And one more thing...${prompt}
  8742: Don't forget how Silver Comet never gave up on her mate.${prompt}
  8743: Even when those they love and believe in have gone, animals will keep on striving.${prompt}
  8744: |-
    Right.
    That's because animals come from the same source as people.${prompt}
  8745: |-
    Adventurer, you can have this.
    Keep this story to yourself.${prompt}
  8746: |-
    Thank you so much!
    And this is from me.${prompt}
  8747: I wonder if that Elvaan girl knows how Silver Comet and Shooting Star were married.${prompt}
  8748: I would like to meet her again some day...${prompt}
  8749: Press any button to continue.${prompt}
  8750: At the request of a certain society, I am investigating the effects of the dreaded “Emptiness” on living beings.${prompt}
  8751: |-
    You appear to be a well-traveled adventurer.
    Perhaps you have seen one of the Emptiness-ravaged creatures of which I speak?${prompt}
  8752: We have labeled these monstrosities “Empty Notorious Monsters,” or ENMs...${prompt}
  8753: |-
    Have you seen one?
    ${selection-lines}
    Indeed I have.
    I'm not quite sure...${prompt}
  8754: |-
    Aha, so you have firsthand experience.
    You probably don't need a scholar's explanation, but please indulge me...${prompt}
  8755: The material presence of ENMs has become temporary and insubstantial, meaning that those who have witnessed a particular ENM's existence are unable to encounter it again until a period of time has passed.${prompt}
  8756: |-
    My research has allowed me to measure the length of time between ENM manifestations.
    Tell me, which ENM would you like to know about?${prompt}
  8757: |-
    I wish to know about the ENM in...
    ${selection-lines}
    Nowhere in particular.
    The Spire of Holla.
    The Spire of Dem.
    The Spire of Mea.
    The Spire of Vahzl.
    Monarch Linn.
    The Shrouded Maw.
    Mine Shaft #2716.
    Bearclaw Pinnacle.
    Boneyard Gully.${prompt}
  8758: 'You won''t be able to encounter that particular ENM until ${vanatime: 1} (${earthtime: 1} Earth time).${prompt}'
  8759: The ENM in that area should be sufficiently manifest for your next encounter.${prompt}
  8760: |-
    You have no need of my expertise at the moment?
    Very well.${prompt}
  8761: And now we come to the crux of the matter...${prompt}
  8762: If there is an ENM that you are currently able to locate, I strongly urge you to take action.${prompt}
  8763: |-
    These...creatures...are no longer natural beings of Vana'diel.
    They must be destroyed.${prompt}
  8764: I cannot elaborate on the details, but know that the fate of the world depends on the early elimination of this threat...${prompt}
  8765: Then perhaps it is best if you forget this conversation entirely.${prompt}
  8766: I hope I have been of some assistance to you.${prompt}
  8767: |-
    This dark plague grows ever stronger...
    If it is not stopped soon...${prompt}

    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}
  8769: |-
    ${name-player}!
    Lady Esha'ntarl's ship has returned.${prompt}
  8770: |-
    This is excellent timing.
    I was ordered to find you and ask that you proceed to the Marble Bridge--the tavern in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}
  8771: |-
    My duty here is done.
    I must now journey to each nation and report that the Wyrmking Bahamut no longer poses a threat.${prompt}
  8772: |-
    I hear that this development is all thanks to you and your companions.
    You have the gratitude of all Jeunoans.${prompt}
  8773: |-
    I have awaited your return, ${name-player}.
    You must tell me all that has happened.${prompt}
  8774: After clashing with our army several times, the dragons suddenly broke off their attack and disappeared into the distant clouds.${prompt}
  8775: There were voices raised in support of hunting the wyrms into extinction, but for the moment we have returned to resupply and reconsider our position.${prompt}
  8776: Now that you are here, I can finally be certain.${prompt}
  8777: Am I to assume from your jubilant features that the Keeper of the Apocalypse has been defeated?${prompt}
  8778: |-
    Has the keeper been defeated?
    ${selection-lines}
    Completely.
    Who can say?${prompt}
  8779: |-
    I knew it!
    Bahamut sensed the keeper's downfall and pulled his forces out of battle...${prompt}
  8780: |-
    Tell me.
    What momentous events transpired in the Celestial Capital?${prompt}
  8781: On Cape Riverne, the images that flowed into me from Selh'teus...${prompt}
  8782: They were of the incomplete Paradise, Al'Taieu...${prompt}
  8783: |-
    The people of Al'Taieu returned to their deity ten thousand years ago.
    Returned to Promathia...${prompt}
  8784: |-
    “Opening the Gates of Paradise” is a metaphor for restoring the shattered mothercrystal.
    A way to return the world to its original state.${prompt}
  8785: |-
    The world becomes a paradise, and its people ascend to godhood.
    The Dawnmaiden Yve'noile has memories of witnessing the true form of the great goddess Altana.${prompt}
  8786: Yve'noile spoke to me before we parted ways.${prompt}
  8787: She said, “As I gazed upon her perfection, I realized I could not be a part of her. I wondered who I could possibly be.”${prompt}
  8788: That was when she began her research into the race of people.${prompt}
  8789: After shifting her focus to the inexplicable appearance of the Kuluu phenomenon, Yve'noile became aware of the darkness that resided within us all.${prompt}
  8790: Her realization led her to betray the king and his son, and adamantly oppose any plan to open the Gates of Paradise.${prompt}
  8791: She had discovered our origins as the children of Promathia...${prompt}
  8792: But all has not been resolved.${prompt}
  8793: The Emptiness still seethes within the mothercrystals.${prompt}
  8794: And the surviving Zilart yet cling desperately to their shadowy plan of returning to Paradise.${prompt}
  8795: I gave up my life in Tavnazia almost thirty years ago to infiltrate the organization of the newly awakened Zilart.${prompt}
  8796: But I have been unable to stem their vast power on my own.${prompt}
  8797: However, we now have a common enemy in the Emptiness. For a time, the people of this age will require the aid of the ancients.${prompt}
  8798: The ancients, too, will need your continuing help.${prompt}
  8799: Surely the Dawn Maiden has bequeathed something of value to her younger kin.${prompt}
  8800: I will find out what this may be, and speak with Archduke Kam'lanaut. He will heed my words.${prompt}
  8801: I shall continue to watch over the world that you and your companions have fought so valiantly to protect.${prompt}
  8802: Now that Nag'molada is gone and the wyrms have ceased their attacks, it is time to remind the Zilart of their true responsibility:${prompt}
  8803: The safety of the mothercrystals and the battle against the Emptiness.${prompt}
  8804: I will continue to monitor their actions as I watch over the world that you and your companions have fought so valiantly to protect.${prompt}
  8805: There is one thing I'd like you to keep in mind, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8806: You were able to save the world and her people without sacrificing one or the other.${prompt}
  8807: But do not misunderstand.${prompt}
  8808: This possibility did not always exist.${prompt}
  8809: It was only with the strength and faith of many people that such a path could open before you.${prompt}
  8810: |-
    I have left with the owner of this tavern three rewards that may help you on your adventures.
    Feel free to choose one.${prompt}
  8811: Until our paths cross once more, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8812: Thank you, and farewell.${prompt}
  8813: |-
    There're so many people in this town.
    It takes me by surprrrise no matter how many times I come here.${prompt}
  8814: |-
    All this activity makes it difficult to get anything done.
    It's enough to make my whiskers curl.${prompt}
  8815: |-
    I don't think you'd be able to help me out, though.
    Why don't you rrrun along?${prompt}
  8816: |-
    Hey, you there.

    Yes. One of the mirrors was being kept in the Empire of Aht Urhgan, but was eventually lost to the world.
    Or so the tale goes...${prompt}
  9823: It was once stored within a small chest and strrrictly guarded, with only selected people permitted to view the mirror itself.${prompt}
  9824: This looking glass supposedly emitted a light of such heart-stopping beauty, it was almost blinding.${prompt}
  9825: This light was so dazzling, it spilled from the chest and soothed the souls of all who gazed upon it.${prompt}
  9826: And so we can deduce from these properties that the mirror lost to the Aht Urhgan Empire was most likely the Glass of Blessed Radiance.${prompt}
  9827: If this mirror still exists somewhere in the world, I would do anything to track it down!${prompt}
  9828: I'm a sucker for beautiful artifacts. And this tale of divine rrradiance makes me want it even more!${prompt}
  9829: '...This book appears to be of considerable age. You did well to discover such a valuable resource.${prompt}'
  9830: Let's see what it has to say.${prompt}
  9831: “Worshipped in the Near East, there is a small mirror whose creation was ordered by a king, now long deceased.”${prompt}
  9832: “As time passed, the looking glass came to be revered as a holy object, and even while it was kept under guard...”${prompt}
  9833: “...people began to call it the Mirror of Blighted Gloom.”${prompt}
  9834: “The blackened metal of the mirror emits a dim, dark light that conjures images of early evening.”${prompt}
  9835: Hmmm...${prompt}
  9836: |-
    That would suggest to me that the brrroken glass I have now is this Mirror of Blighted Gloom.
    The description fits perfectly.${prompt}
  9837: The explanation continues...${prompt}
  9838: “This metal is like no other substance we have ever encountered.”${prompt}
  9839: “Expert scientists concur that while this substance gives off a metallic glint...”${prompt}
  9840: “...it has a malleable structure at room temperature almost like a liquid. However, for reasons unknown, it is able to maintain its shape.”${prompt}
  9841: “The metal used by the creators of the mirror no longer exists, and as such, it would be impossible to duplicate its creation today.”${prompt}
  9842: |-
    No longer exists...!
    Then how am I supposed to...?${prompt}
  9843: What else does it say?${prompt}
  9844: What else does it say?${prompt}

  9856: “However, the method for crafting the mirror has been discovered and follows these steps:”${prompt}
  9857: “One. Prepare the metal that is to become the body of the mirror.”${prompt}
  9858: “Two. Find a spring with a surface as smooth as glass. The spring must be filled with clear water.”${prompt}
  9859: |-
    “Three. Chant the charm, and offer a prayer.

    Sure.
    Not now.${prompt}
  10885: Well then, you must come back when you have more time!${prompt}
  10886: I believe this is our first meeting.${prompt}
  10887: |-
    I am Afdeen, pupil of the great Abdhaljs before even Tillecoe.
    A pleasure to make your acquaintance.${prompt}
  10888: There is a reason why I am here. Allow me to explain...${prompt}
  10889: An interesting idea was proposed at the last Conquest Evaluation Assembly...${prompt}
  10890: '...And so it seems that the adventurers are using their own unique set of rules for Ballista.${prompt}'
  10891: There is also the remarkable news that the most capable adventurers in the world came together for a tournament that encompassed the greater part of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  10892: Ballista has been taken out of our hands and placed into those of the adventurers.${prompt}
  10893: I agree. The Ballista participants have forced us to recall the true meaning of the word “hero.”${prompt}
  10894: The revival of Ballista has raised morale and restored public order. I suppose we have achieved our original goals.${prompt}
  10895: '...We have, have we?${prompt}'
  10896: It certainly sounds like someone's a mite bitter...${prompt}
  10897: |-
    Volker can't just mumble and grumble at Destin's baby boy.
    If you want an explanation, then stop being coy!${prompt}
  10898: |-
    You have to charge in! Be frank and direct.
    That's the only way to get the response you expect!${prompt}
  10899: What did you just call me!?${prompt}
  10900: |-
    Stop quarreling! It is my fault for mumbling to myself.
    Please listen to what I have to say.${prompt}
  10901: I agree that the San d'Orian Royal Knights are endowed with sound, quick decision-making abilities and deserve admiration.${prompt}
  10902: The deeds of a single hero are capable of setting afire the hearts of many a soldier. We must not neglect the power of motivation in leading an army to victory.${prompt}
  10903: Even so, soldiers must be able to follow their commander's orders and fulfill their given roles. Arbitrary decisions can lead an entire army to its doom.${prompt}
  10904: Thus, I am of the opinion that observing Ballista matches in their current state may not be a beneficial practice for our armies.${prompt}
  10905: |-
    Your remarks are inexcusable!
    How dare you denounce a San d'Orian tradition! I suggest you reconsider your statements.${prompt}
  10906: |-
    I apologize.
    I must admit that Ballista has noticeably improved the skills of many an adventurer and educated our soldiers on the importance of courage.${prompt}
  10907: However, the reality is that our armies are divided into several units, each with its own role. The soldiers must be able to coordinate themselves effectively and behave as a whole. I believe that a new form of Conflict that trains participants to work in a group would be most rewarding.${prompt}
  10908: |-
    Harumph, do we look like children to you?
    You could have cut that explanation in half and it would have been more than sufficientaru!${prompt}
  10909: All right then. I'll get straight to the point now.${prompt}
  10910: |-
    Oh, give us a break!
    What point could you make?
    All your vague statements and whatnot!
    Why not lend an ear to what I've got?${prompt}
  10911: |-
    No thanks...
    Well then, I shall be frank.${prompt}
  10912: I propose the reinstatement of “Brenner” as a new form of Conflict!${prompt}
  10913: Brenner!?${prompt}
  10914: |-
    I remember that name. Before the Great War, Brenner was used in the selection of the Gold Musketeers.
    However, the competition was extraordinarily fierce, and it is said that the casualties always exceeded the number of successful candidates.${prompt}
  10915: Those stories were fabricated simply to exaggerate the danger of Brenner.${prompt}
  10916: |-
    Brenner was originally created as a training exercise for mineworkers.
    The outcome of each match relied on the participants' skill in role management and encouraged team competition.${prompt}
  10917: Of course, I am not suggesting that we abolish Ballista. I simply advise that we add Brenner to the list of training options in order to supply the elements of teamwork that I find lacking in current matches.${prompt}
  10918: |-
    Hmph, so you wish to fortify your army by tying them tightly together in iron bonds.
    How very-wery Bastokan!${prompt}
  10919: |-
    Ohohoho!
    Still, the idea makes my heart race!
    I even support it. You make a good case!${prompt}
  10920: |-
    Ohohoho!
    So if your weaklings unite,
    you think you can win any fight?${prompt}
  10921: |-
    Oho, this is rich!
    May your plan go without hitch!${prompt}
  10922: |-
    I will support your plan, but please be aware
    that against the black mages, no one's got a prayer!${prompt}
  10923: |-
    If it will supplement Ballista, I believe that even Excenmille would have no argument.
    You have my approval.${prompt}
  10924: |-
    I appreciate your decision.
    Now I also would like to suggest that we do away with the license requirement and nationality restrictions for Brenner.${prompt}
  10925: |-
    Quite a bold statement.
    However, teams would be composed of complete strangers if we enforce what you propose. Is that your desire?${prompt}
  10926: The adventurers have taught me much, but one of the greatest lessons I have learned is the strength of the bond between linkshell members.${prompt}
  10927: Linkshells provide an exemplary model of unity. The cooperation and friendly competition of these groups are like those of the closest companions or even family. And thus, I propose that we introduce matches divided by linkshell rather than nation.${prompt}
  10928: |-
    Interesting. You seem to have worked out these plans more thoroughly than I expected.
    Have you also given consideration to where the matches will be held?${prompt}
  10929: |-
    Of course.
    Wolfgang, shall we invite our guest in now?${prompt}
  10930: A pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am called Afdeen.${prompt}
  10931: I have come to your lands by order of the great Abdhaljs.${prompt}
  10932: |-
    By Altana!
    Do you mean to suggest that you are a direct disciple of Sir Abdhaljs? I believe I have heard your name before.${prompt}
  10933: |-
    Is your master in good health?
    He deserves our gratitude for the Diorama...${prompt}
  10934: Yes, he is quite well. However, he desires no reward. He is quite pleased with the Ballista matches that take place each day in the Diorama.${prompt}
  10935: On another note, he has expressed interest in a new form of Conflict. He has entrusted me with matters regarding his new diorama, which is designed after Purgonorgo Isle.${prompt}
  10936: The great Abdhaljs has created a new diorama specifically for this new form of Conflict? Magnificent! You will hear no argument from me.${prompt}
  10937: That's dandy-wandy, but don't forget that Windurst won't lend a single gil to the project!${prompt}
  10938: |-
    Well, there you have it. The preparations sound fine!
    Okay then, inform me when Windurst is next in line!${prompt}
  10939: The reinstatement of Brenner has now been approved!${prompt}
  10940: I will send a detailed explanation of the rules to each of you. If you should have any objections, please take them up with Sir Wolfgang.${prompt}
  10941: Obviously, the citizens of Windurst have the closestaru bond. Our adventurers will have to teach the rest of you a thing or two about teamwork now.${prompt}
  10942: |-
    I am simply beside myself--my prayers will not cease!
    Wishing your people get through this in one piece!
    Ohohoho～!${prompt}
  10943: |-
    I will not stand for these meaningless insults against the Royal Knights!
    Our records in Ballista prove our prowess in working as a team.${prompt}
  10944: I think it is time to call this meeting to a close. Thank you all for your participation.${prompt}
  10945: How can any idea be interesting when Bastok thoughtaru of it first?${prompt}
  10946: |-
    You're missing the point--this'll make them prepared
    for the time that they're needed, my plans unimpaired!${prompt}
  10947: Your plans? You can't mean...${prompt}
  10948: |-
    Now to just wait and see
    what Brenner will bring to me!${prompt}
  10949: |-
    I'll need many a strong adventurer
    for my grand plans, that's for sure!
    Ohohoho!${prompt}
  10950: |-
    Sending Ajido-Marujido to the assembly had results most intriguing.
    They actually helped me save time for my scheming!${prompt}
  10951: |-
    And time waits for no man!
    But lucky me--I'm a woman!
    Ohohohoho!${prompt}
  10952: '...And that, roughly, is how Brenner was reinstated.${prompt}'

  11413: They provide courses on practical chocobo riding and the proper ways to care for a chocobo, as well as working to improve the treatment of chocobos from here to Aht Urhgan.${prompt}

  11415: Chicks hatch from eggs, grow into young chocobos, and finally mature.${prompt}
  11416: They grow much faster than people do. Usually it takes about 1 month (Earth time) before you can ride your chocobo.${prompt}
  11417: The chocobo's traits are determined by the way in which you care for your animal. Without proper planning, you won't be able to raise the type of chocobo that you want.${prompt}

  11420: “Strength” is a term used to describe the chocobo's leg power. The more strength a chocobo has, the faster it will be able to run. Rental chocobos have been raised with an emphasis on this attribute.${prompt}
  11421: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  11422: “Endurance” is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.${prompt}
  11423: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  11424: “Discernment” is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.${prompt}
  11425: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  11426: “Receptivity” is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.${prompt}
  11427: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  11428: “Energy” is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.${prompt}
  11429: You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!${prompt}
  11430: “Affection” is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!${prompt}
  11431: You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.${prompt}
  11432: 'If you really want to raise your chocobo''s affection quickly, you can give it ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, but I can''t recommend doing so unless absolutely necessary.${prompt}'
  11433: “Satisfaction” is a term used to describe how full or hungry your chocobo is. If your chocobo is full, it will gain a lot of energy before the next day.${prompt}

    Nothing.${prompt}
  11436: A care schedule is a series of plans that you set up for your chocobo so that we can take care of it while you are away.${prompt}
  11437: How you want us to care for your chocobo each day is completely up to you.${prompt}
  11438: You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).${prompt}
  11439: When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.${prompt}
  11440: With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.${prompt}
  11441: The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.${prompt}
  11442: You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.${prompt}
  11443: The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.${prompt}
  11444: However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.${prompt}
  11445: We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.${prompt}
  11446: Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.${prompt}
  11447: Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.${prompt}
  11448: If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  11449: Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.${prompt}
  11450: If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  11451: Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.${prompt}
  11452: However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.${prompt}
  11453: If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  11454: Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.${prompt}
  11455: But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.${prompt}
  11456: If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  11457: You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  11458: The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.${prompt}
  11459: You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.${prompt}
  11460: The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.${prompt}
  11461: You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  11462: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  11463: You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.${prompt}
  11464: The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.${prompt}
  11465: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  11466: You can choose to have your chocobo act as an extra in a play to improve its receptivity.${prompt}

    Competing.
    Taking a walk.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  11469: In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  11470: Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.${prompt}
  11471: On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.${prompt}
  11472: However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.${prompt}
  11473: You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  11474: Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.${prompt}
  11475: You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.${prompt}
  11476: I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)${prompt}
  11477: Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.${prompt}
  11478: This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.${prompt}
  11479: Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.${prompt}
  11480: You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.${prompt}
  11481: I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.${prompt}
  11482: Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!${prompt}

    Vegetables.
    Wildgrasses.
    Carrots.
    Worms.
    Medicines.
    Pastes.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  11484: Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.${prompt}
  11485: However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.${prompt}
  11486: The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.${prompt}
  11487: At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!${prompt}
  11488: Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.${prompt}
  11489: There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!${prompt}
  11490: 'Just ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.${prompt}'

  11492: 'Chocobos also seem to enjoy ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  11493: These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.${prompt}
  11494: Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.${prompt}
  11495: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, the effects are different.${prompt}'
  11496: 'In addition, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is effective for illness, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for a stomachache. It''s a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.${prompt}'

  11498: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}, for example, affect the chocobo''s physical attributes, and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are good for its mental attributes. ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 2[2]} are in a category of their own.${prompt}'
  11499: Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  11500: Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!${prompt}
  11501: 'For example, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will dramatically increase your chocobo''s affection, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will restore its energy.${prompt}'
  11502: But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...${prompt}
  11503: 'The most curious of all the worms is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...${prompt}'
  11504: Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  11505: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will restore your chocobo''s energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.${prompt}'
  11506: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.${prompt}'
  11507: A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.${prompt}
  11508: Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.${prompt}
  11509: You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.${prompt}

    Abilities.
    Temperament.
    Weather preferences.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  11512: Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.${prompt}
  11513: For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.${prompt}
  11514: Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.${prompt}
  11515: But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.${prompt}
  11516: The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.${prompt}
  11517: Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.${prompt}
  11518: Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.${prompt}
  11519: Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.${prompt}
  11520: You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.${prompt}
  11521: After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.${prompt}
  11522: 'When your chocobo retires, you will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Be sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  11523: 'You can use the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  11524: The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!${prompt}
  11525: When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.${prompt}
  11526: 'You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}'
  11527: 'You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  11528: I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.${prompt}
  11529: 'When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  11530: You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  11531: That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.${prompt}

    Ah, my favorite customer!
    I've been hoping you'd walk through my door.${prompt}

  11782: |-
    Hm? Beautiful?
    Oh yes, she was quite attractive...${prompt}
  11783: Oh! The ring! Yes, exquisite!${prompt}
  11784: You must have dropped it right outside the tavern--I found it lying on one of the drains at the bottom of the stairs.${prompt}
  11785: |-
    You're lucky it got caught in the grille.
    One good storm and it would've been washed out to sea!${prompt}
  11786: Ah, yes!${prompt}
  11787: |-
    It just so happens that I have yet to return the remaining rings.
    Which means I have all three rattling in my hand here.${prompt}
  11788: |-
    Sooo...

    What's your poison?

    I-I'm not ready...

  11791: |-
    I tell you what; I'll be happy to look after them until you're ready to make a decision.
    Please come again any time!${prompt}

    You seem distraught, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/madame]...
    You've gone and dropped it again, haven't you?${prompt}
  11793: And it just so happens that I found another ring lying in the exact same place.${prompt}
  11794: The thing is, though...${prompt}
  11795: |-
    It rolled away when I tried to pick it up.
    I'm not sure if it was yours or not.${prompt}
  11796: Although, the look on your face tells me...${prompt}
  11797: Hm? The other rings?${prompt}
  11798: Now, now, let's not be greedy, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/madame].${prompt}
  11799: I made a promise to a customer--you can't ask me to break my word.${prompt}

    Do you want to be a dancer?

    I surely do.
    No, I have two left feet.${prompt}

    Wonderful.

    I can't be lettin' in ev'ry heavy-footed Galka and rhythmless Hume that walks in me door.

  11815: |-
    I began studying here after one of Laila's performances moved me to tears.
    Such grrrace...such talent...${prompt}
  11816: |-
    I overheard you speaking with Laila.
    So, you think you can dance?${prompt}
  11817: You'll have to show you're absolutely committed before she'll even think about taking you under her wing.${prompt}
  11818: 'Maybe I could ask Laila for some hints about this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. But how can I be sure you''re rrreally serious...?${prompt}'
  11819: |-
    I know!
    Have you heard of the Lion Springs Tavern in San d'Oria?${prompt}
  11820: If you have the courrrage to dance on that stage, it will prrrove to me you have a passion for performance.${prompt}
  11821: 'If you have the courrrage to dance on the stage in the Lion Springs Tavern, I''ll ask Laila about that ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  11822: That must have been some performance you put on in the Lion Springs. News of your “unique” dancing style made it all the way to Jeuno.${prompt}
  11823: Well, I guess I have to keep my end of the deal and tell you what I learned about that stone.${prompt}
  11824: 'I hate to brrreak it to you, but finding ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} might be close to impossible.${prompt}'
  11825: 'Twenty years ago, ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} could be found lying at the bottom of Lake Mechieume in Jugner Forest.${prompt}'
  11826: But their dazzling glow made them such a collector's item that not a single one remains there today.${prompt}
  11827: I believe our merciless leader has set you a task that cannot be completed.${prompt}
  11828: |-
    It's a shame.
    While you still lack the skill, you certainly have the spirit of a dancer...${prompt}
  11829: Ye here again?${prompt}
  11830: |-
    Ye've brought me ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}?

  11834: |-
    <Sigh>...
    Well, ye were up t'the task, and no mistakin'.
    Welcome to Troupe Brilioth.${prompt}
  11835: 'Ye know, I have another ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, but its light faded years ago...${prompt}'
  11836: Lookin' at this rock reminds me o' the day I learned the true joy of dancin'.${prompt}
  11837: I can still hear the sound of the pipes...${prompt}
  11838: '...?${prompt}'
  11839: Ye look awfully familiar fer some reason...${prompt}
  11840: Nah, it couldn't be...${prompt}
  11841: Now, before ye begin yer trainin', let me tell ye a little somethin' about the origin o' our dance.${prompt}
  11842: It's a martial style based on the traditional Bastokan “Kriegstanz”--a dance used in actual battle.${prompt}
  11843: O' course, we've learned how t'adapt this martial style into a form suitable fer performances.${prompt}
  11844: But first, ye'll have t'work on the basic, martial movements.${prompt}
  11845: |-
    Rhea!
    Show this rookie the ropes!${prompt}
  11846: And now yer body has been conditioned fer the fundamental movements o' the Kriegstanz.${prompt}
  11847: |-
    Don't just stand there scuffin' yer feet!
    I expect ye t'spend ev'ry spare moment practicin' those moves!
    Troupe Brilioth only accepts the best!${prompt}
  11848: You can now become a dancer!${prompt}
  11849: |-
    Dance is learned by doin', not by watchin'.
    Get yer body movin', and dance until ye drop!${prompt}
  11850: |-
    What are you gawpin' at?
    I don't give out autographs.${prompt}
  11851: 'I''m glad you''ve joined our little grrroup, but be warned: the hard work has only just begun!${prompt}'
  11852: |-
    They're so pretty!
    I wanna be a dancer too someday!${prompt}
  11853: Two maidens of the battlefield...and a Galka?${prompt}
  11854: There are many “dancers,” but only a select few are truly brilliant.${prompt}
  11855: |-
    And among those brilliant few, they say the most talented and graceful is visited by the Divinity of Dance.
    Could that be true?${prompt}
  11856: I've learned a lot about the Crystal War while looking after Ilumida.${prompt}
  11857: She's even told me about those awful statues people are calling “maws.”${prompt}
  11858: I haven't had the experience myself, but they say just the very sight of these idols brings back the most horrendous memories of the war...${prompt}
  11859: |-
    I wonder if there are other things in the world that remind people of that horrible time.
    If only such atrocities could be buried forever.${prompt}
  11860: Do the beastmen also have a god to whom they pray, in the same way we ask for the blessings of Altana?${prompt}
  11861: |-
    Although I'm not sure I would want to know what twisted prayers the beastmen might make.
    Would you?${prompt}
  11862: Why, isn't it ${name-player}? Been workin' hard on yer steps, have ye?${prompt}
  11863: Why don't ye show me some o' yer moves? Go on, let me see.${prompt}
  11864: Hmmm...sharp, conf'dent steps, an' great upper body balance t'boot. Without a doubt, ye've improved.${prompt}
  11865: Looks like ye've been faithfully rehearsin' the basics o' our martial style, the “Kriegstanz.”${prompt}
  11866: But yer dance still lacks a certain...“shine.”${prompt}
  11867: Listen up. What Troupe Brilioth is aimin' fer is a dance style that captivates an' enchants.${prompt}
  11868: I want ye to think about how ye can make yer dance “shine.”${prompt}
  11869: What Troupe Brilioth is aimin' fer is a dance style that captivates and enchants.${prompt}
  11870: What? You want to know what's lacking in your dance?${prompt}
  11871: That's a tough one... I personally believe you've imprrroved in leaps and bounds.${prompt}
  11872: Laila once told me about her childhood. Witchfire Glen, in Grauberg, was where her mother taught her to dance. She said that it was there she learned the true essence of dance.${prompt}
  11873: During the Great War, Witchfire Glen was rumored to be a mystical place, where pixies could be seen frolicking.${prompt}
  11874: Laila's mother selected only the most talented dancers, and trrrained them there. I would love to have been part of those lessons!${prompt}
  11875: I'm sorry I couldn't help you spice up your steps...${prompt}
  11876: Laila's mother selected only the most talented dancers, and trrrained them at Witchfire Glen, in Grauberg.${prompt}
  11877: So, ${name-player}. Did ye work out how to make yer dance “shine”?${prompt}
  11878: Ye think ye got the goods now? Go on then, give us a gander.${prompt}
  11879: Well, well, wasn't that somethin'.${prompt}
  11880: |-
    “A masterful dance can be the most lethal of weapons; a skillful fight, the most elegant of dances.”
    These be the words of me dear mother.${prompt}
  11881: But there's a key difference b'tween dancin' on stage, an' dancin' in battle.${prompt}
  11882: On stage, ye're dancin' in front o' an audience, with the goal o' bringin' smiles to their faces.${prompt}
  11883: Yer desire to entertain an' please the audience is what makes yer dance “shine.” Don't ye be forgettin' that.${prompt}
  11884: Laila! I've just met with Wyatt, the guy who runs a business prrromoting performance troupes...${prompt}
  11885: He said that Troupe Valeriano is next scheduled to perform rrright here, in Jeuno.${prompt}
  11886: Troupe Valeriano...in Jeuno!?${prompt}
  11887: Apparently, the leader of the trrroupe wants to come speak with you when they arrive.${prompt}
  11888: What business would the likes o' Troupe Valeriano possibly have with me?${prompt}
  11889: '...${prompt}'
  11890: Hey hey, that's enough daydreamin' already! Get back t'yer practicin'!${prompt}
  11891: I won't tolerate any o' yer makin' a fool o' yerself in front o' Troupe Valeriano!${prompt}
  11892: I wonder why she's gotten crrranky all of a sudden.${prompt}
  11893: Just a minute ago she was singing prrraises of you, ${name-player}, and even asked me to prepare something to give to you.${prompt}
  11894: I didn't think the news would tick her off like that... No news is good news, huh?${prompt}
  11895: Enough with the daydreamin'! ${name-player}, I wanna see more “shine” on that dance o' yers!${prompt}
  11896: I wonder why she's gotten cranky all of a sudden...${prompt}
  11897: Practicin' hard, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  11898: Show me yer progress from time t'time, will ye?${prompt}
  11899: Hmmm...${prompt}
  11900: Not bad, but ye still have a long way t'go if ye want t'be diva o' the dance troupe.${prompt}
  11901: Have ye ever danced to a musician's tune?${prompt}
  11902: On stage, a dancer must be one with the musicians who perform the accompaniment.${prompt}
  11903: Even when ye practice, ye've to visualize the music in yer mind, or ye'll become a self-centered dancer.${prompt}
  11904: An' I guarantee ye, self-centered dancers don't get very far.${prompt}
  11905: To become a top-notch dancer, ye have t'work with a top-notch musician. I recommend ye find yerself a good musician who'll play a tune fer ye t'dance to.${prompt}
  11906: Let me tell ye a story. When I was little, I once skipped practice an' stole off to a lake in Jugner Forest. It was there that me ears were treated to a most marvelous pipe tune. Its soul-stirrin' melody is still vivid in me mind t'this day.${prompt}
  11907: Even though I never actually saw the person playin', it was this chance encounter that made me the dancer I am today.${prompt}
  11908: If only I knew who was playing that tune, I would share its inspiration with ye, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11909: |-
    <Sigh>
    It was such a long time ago...${prompt}
  11910: If ye want t'become a top-notch dancer, ye better go an' find a top-notch musician t'work with.${prompt}
  11911: I wish I could meet a splendid musician who could strrrum on my heartstrings.${prompt}
  11912: Ye say ye met a bard who played a tune fer ye t'dance to?${prompt}
  11913: Alright then, let's see how ye've improved.${prompt}
  11914: '...!${prompt}'
  11915: Th-that was incredible! ${prompt}
  11916: That bard ye met must've been quite somethin'.${prompt}
  11917: It's high time ye had this.${prompt}
  11918: Ye've come a long way, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11919: 'T''be honest, on the day ye brought the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} an'' I had t''accept ye into Troupe Brilioth, I didn''t know how ye''d turn out.${prompt}'
  11920: But ye've exceeded all expectations.${prompt}
  11921: Aye, it's unfortunate, but the pebble ye brought has lost its glow.${prompt}
  11922: The same happened with me pebble I've had with me fer ages. See?${prompt}
  11923: What the...!?${prompt}
  11924: Excuse me, but you are Troupe Brilioth, are you not? It is an honor to meet you.${prompt}
  11925: V-Valeriano!${prompt}
  11926: What? Can it really be...Laila? It's you, isn't it!${prompt}
  11927: You know each other, Laila?${prompt}
  11928: N-no...${prompt}
  11929: You don't remember? Ten years ago...you came to me wanting to join Troupe Valeriano.${prompt}
  11930: No way!!!${prompt}
  11931: Is it trrrue, Laila?${prompt}
  11932: |-
    <Sigh>
    I suppose there's no use hidin' it...${prompt}
  11933: My, my, what a splendid dancer you have matured into! When I heard the news from Wyatt about the promising new dance troupe, I had a hunch that you'd be the one behind it, Laila.${prompt}
  11934: And such a fine dance troupe under your wings! Now I am certain it was the right decision to turn you down ten years ago.${prompt}
  11935: I've been looking forward to seeing you dance again, Laila. I'll be seeing more of you soon!${prompt}
  11936: Laila... What he just said...${prompt}
  11937: All o' it's true, Rhea.${prompt}
  11938: Except fer one thing... He has never, ever, seen me dance. How can he look forward t'seein' me “again” when he has never seen me...even once?${prompt}
  11939: How horrible!${prompt}
  11940: Ten years ago, me mother staged a big dance production, an' I was selected fer the lead role.${prompt}
  11941: It was the proudest moment in me life. It was all the more special because Mother was a strict teacher who didn't give special favors t'anyone, not even her own daughter.${prompt}
  11942: Not long after me debut as lead, Troupe Valeriano came t'town.${prompt}
  11943: Even back then, Troupe Valeriano had already grown into a circus o' a grand scale, with musicians as well as dancers in its repertory.${prompt}
  11944: Their performances were a hit with both young and old.${prompt}
  11945: It was the first circus I'd ever seen in me life, an' I was hopelessly spellbound.${prompt}
  11946: By the time they were packin' up t'move on, I was determined to join them. I wanted t'join Troupe Valeriano so badly, I took no heed o' objections from those around me.${prompt}
  11947: Waaait!${prompt}
  11948: And you are...?${prompt}
  11949: Me name's Laila Brilioth, an' I'm the number one dancer in town!${prompt}
  11950: Aaah, yes...${prompt}
  11951: I went to yer troupe's performances, and I liked what I saw!${prompt}
  11952: Why, I'm pleased to hear that. Thank you.${prompt}
  11953: So I've decided t'join ye.${prompt}
  11954: Is that so...${prompt}
  11955: Yer troupe will be soooooo much better with me dancin'.${prompt}
  11956: Thank you for offering...${prompt}
  11957: But, no thank you.${prompt}
  11958: Huh...?${prompt}
  11959: I'm afraid I cannot accept you into our troupe.${prompt}
  11960: I don't understand... Why won't ye accept me!?${prompt}
  11961: If ye would just watch me dance, ye'll see how good I am!${prompt}
  11962: I've already made up my mind, so that won't be necessary. I'm very sorry...${prompt}
  11963: '...${prompt}'
  11964: |-
    <Sniffle>
    Such a heartbreaking story...${prompt}
  11965: Not long after that, a great fire burned down Troupe Valeriano's tent an' all their equipment. The members were forced t'disband.${prompt}
  11966: All the dancers left, too.${prompt}
  11967: It was a big setback, an' I sincerely sympathize with them fer their misfortune. But, I've never forgotten the humiliation I felt when I was rejected.${prompt}
  11968: After the incident, I left home an' formed Troupe Brilioth.${prompt}
  11969: I was determined to surpass Troupe Valeriano, and did all I could t'get where I am today.${prompt}
  11970: I'm proud o' what I've achieved. But above that, I'm proud o' all o' ye.${prompt}
  11971: I've never forgotten the humiliation I felt when I was rejected by Valeriano.${prompt}
  11972: I never knew Laila had crossed paths with Troupe Valeriano in the past...${prompt}
  11973: I can't believe Troupe Valeriano rejected a great dancer like Laila... What were they thinking? ${prompt}
  11974: ${name-player}, just the adventurer I was lookin' fer.${prompt}
  11975: I was thinkin' it's about time ye stepped on stage, an'...${prompt}
  11976: '...?${prompt}'
  11977: Howdy folks! You mus' be Troupe Brilioth!${prompt}
  11978: An' who might ye be?${prompt}
  11979: The name's Wyatt, an' I work in the performance business. Boy have I godda proposal fur you!${prompt}
  11980: Fur mah next production, I've organized fur Troupe Valeriano t'come an' perform raht 'ere in Jeuno.${prompt}
  11981: An' I was thinkin' t'mahself, how magnificen' it would be if troupes Brilioth an' Valeriano could collaborate in a circus an' dance extravaganza!${prompt}
  11982: These be the deetails o' mah proposal... So whad'ya think?${prompt}
  11983: Sounds interestin'... But what does Troupe Valeriano have t'say about it?${prompt}
  11984: Well ma'am, that's jes' the prawblem... Troupe Valeriano's bayn busy tourin' the three nations, so I haven't had a chance t'speak with'em prawperly yet.${prompt}
  11985: Why don't ye leave that to us? We'll go an' inform Valeriano fer ye.${prompt}
  11986: Well ain't that sweet! I'd be most grateful if you could pass the proposal to them. Guess I'll be seein' y'all later then.${prompt}
  11987: ${name-player}, I want ye to take this proposal to the music shop in Bastok Markets, an' pass it to the owner o' the establishment.${prompt}
  11988: Valeriano often goes there, so I'm told. ${prompt}
  11989: 'Pass ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to the owner o'' the music shop in Bastok Markets. Valeriano is supposed t''be a regular patron.${prompt}'
  11990: Why did Laila agrrree to a collaboration? I thought she didn't like Troupe Valeriano... ${prompt}
  11991: Oh dear... Just thinking about performing alongside Troupe Valeriano gives me butterflies.${prompt}
  11992: What? Ye met Valeriano himself at the music shop?${prompt}
  11993: So...what did he think about the proposal?${prompt}
  11994: Really? He was that enthusiastic? Well, isn't that sweet...${prompt}
  11995: Hahahahahaaa!${prompt}
  11996: I've been waitin' fer this day fer so long...the day I surpass Valeriano.${prompt}
  11997: When Wyatt came here an' told us about his plan, I could barely contain me excitement.${prompt}
  11998: Needless t'say, ye'll dance with us too, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11999: This is the perfect opportunity...${prompt}
  12000: We'll show Troupe Valeriano who the audience prefers.${prompt}
  12001: That reminds me, ye've never performed on stage before, have ye?${prompt}
  12002: If ye ask Rhea Myuliah, she'll give ye tips an' tricks on how t'please the crowd when ye dance.${prompt}
  12003: We're dancin' fer real this time, so no slackin' off before the performance!${prompt}
  12004: No slackin' off before the performance!${prompt}
  12005: A collaboration's one thing, but a showdown? What could Laila possibly be thinking?${prompt}
  12006: For the upcoming performance, we will dance with Troupe Valeriano perforrrming beside us.${prompt}
  12007: "The whole purpose of the collaborrration is to allow the audience to enjoy both circus and dance performances simultaneously... \nBut Laila is hell-bent on outdoing Troupe Valeriano.${prompt}"
  12008: So we must perform a style of dance that will please and drrraw the audience's attention.${prompt}
  12009: Just to give you a general idea...${prompt}
  12010: Younger folk tend to prrrefer waltz, the elderly are more fond of samba, while little kiddies can't get enough of jigs.${prompt}
  12011: While you're dancing, observe what type of crrrowd is watching Troupe Valeriano's circus performance, then dance a style that is to their taste.${prompt}

  12013: But you also mustn't neglect those who are alrrready watching us.${prompt}

  12022: Please excuse our lateness. I hope you were not waiting too long.${prompt}
  12023: I've been waitin' ten whole years. A few more minutes won't make any difference.${prompt}

  12025: Valeriano, today's the day I make ye regret ye ever rejected me!${prompt}

  12030: Rrright away, Laila.${prompt}
  12031: Ye got it?${prompt}
  12032: Give the audience what they want so they watch us an' not Troupe Valeriano!${prompt}
  12033: That's enough talk. ${name-player}, show them what ye got!${prompt}
  12034: "Alright then... \n${name-player}! It's showtime!!!${prompt}"
  12035: Laila, we've lost almost the entire audience to Troupe Valeriano!${prompt}
  12036: Grrr... We'll save the rest fer tomorrow. This isn't over yet... ${prompt}
  12037: We'll show them next time.${prompt}
  12038: Losing to Troupe Valeriano like that... <Sigh>${prompt}
  12039: We went easy on ye yesterday, but no more! Today I'll make ye regret ever rejectin' me from joinin' Troupe Valeriano!${prompt}
  12040: Sir, the dancers have snatched the audience away from us...${prompt}
  12041: (Laila, what has become of you...?)${prompt}
  12042: (This is not what I had envisioned...not what I came for...)${prompt}
  12043: (What I wanted...was...)${prompt}
  12044: That pipe...?${prompt}
  12045: Could this be true...?${prompt}
  12046: All those years ago, ye were the one playin' the pipe at Lake Mechieume...${prompt}
  12047: Heard the silvery sound of the boss's piping before, have you?${prompt}
  12048: Aye... A long time ago, when I was but a child...${prompt}
  12049: |-
    I was born daughter to a renowned family o' dancers, an' grew up in the midst o' the Crystal War...
    Dance was me life, an' all I knew. But one day I became fed up with day after day o' endless drills, an' decided to run away from home.${prompt}
  12050: That was when I first heard the pipe, down by Lake Mechieume. Its soul-stirrin' melody flowed through me, guidin' each step, each whirl an' pirouette...${prompt}
  12051: It revived me dwindlin' passion fer dance an' inspired me t'continue. Everythin' I have, I owe to that pipe.${prompt}
  12052: I haven't forgotten that day, Laila...the day I first saw you dance.${prompt}
  12053: You were watchin'...?${prompt}
  12054: It was the most uplifting sight I have ever had the privilege of laying my eyes upon.${prompt}
  12055: When ${name-player} delivered the proposal to me in Bastok, I thanked the Goddess for giving me the opportunity to watch you dance once more.${prompt}
  12056: '......${prompt}'
  12057: B-but I can't do it... I don't have it in me anymore. Since the day ye rejected me, me sole purpose in life has been t'surpass ye.${prompt}
  12058: The only reason I've been dancin' all these years, was so I could look down me nose at ye. I-I don't deserve t'be a dancer...${prompt}
  12059: I am to blame for having caused you so much pain. Please forgive me, Laila.${prompt}
  12060: But...I still firmly believe I made the right decision. It would have been wrong to accept the most promising young dancer Vana'diel has ever seen into our troupe.${prompt}
  12061: What...?${prompt}
  12062: You were brought up surrounded by loved ones, and destined to become successor to the famed Brilioth style.${prompt}
  12063: Though tender of age, your talent had already bloomed beyond compare. Never before had such a young dancer been selected lead in your mother's production--even I knew this...${prompt}
  12064: But I had no right to pluck you away from where you belonged.${prompt}
  12065: You deserved so much more than I could have ever offered in my troupe.${prompt}
  12066: No circus tent could ever be large enough for you to grow and fulfill your potential, Laila...${prompt}
  12067: So...ye rejected me not because ye didn't think I was good enough?${prompt}
  12068: The answer is clear, Laila. You are everything a dancer could ever wish to be.${prompt}
  12069: I regret not having explained my decision more clearly when I turned you down.${prompt}
  12070: Even if ye did, I don't think I would've understood...${prompt}
  12071: I so wanted t'join Troupe Valeriano, I lost sight o' all those who cared about me most...${prompt}
  12072: I was--am--just a stupid girl...${prompt}
  12073: You need not be ashamed.${prompt}
  12074: Just look at the wonderful dance troupe that you have created! Cast your eyes upon the scores of fans who love you!${prompt}
  12075: V-Valeriano...${prompt}
  12076: Laila... Will you do me the great honor of dancing for me? Just like that time so many years ago?${prompt}
  12077: Aye!${prompt}
  12078: I have never enjoyed performing as I did today. I very much look forward to our next collaboration.${prompt}
  12079: Alright everyone, it's time to go.${prompt}
  12080: Hm?
  12081: That pebble...${prompt}
  12082: 'My ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}''s twin... So you had it with you all this time.${prompt}'
  12083: They finally found each other again...${prompt}
  12084: I'm goin' t'start over. Just like the day I found this pebble by the lake.${prompt}
  12085: I trust it will not take another twenty years before I next see you dance. All the best, Laila.${prompt}
  12086: Were my eyes just playing trrricks on me? Could it actually be...true?${prompt}
  12087: What am I talking about?${prompt}
  12088: You see, there is a legend that says that the most talented and grrraceful of dancers are visited by the Divinity of Dance.${prompt}
  12089: But I never actually believed it until this day... Just now when Laila was dancing, I could have sworn...${prompt}
  12090: But beforrre I forget, Laila was wanting to give something to you, ${name-player}. Why don't you go and speak with her?${prompt}
  12091: That was a helluva debut performance, ${name-player}. Ye never cease t'impress me.${prompt}
  12092: Nothin' rings truer than “practice makes perfect.” Here, this is fer all yer hard work.${prompt}
  12093: I've been such a fool all these years, usin' dance just t'try to patch up me broken ego.${prompt}
  12094: It's kinda embarrassin' to admit, but I haven't enjoyed dancin' like that fer ages.${prompt}
  12095: How I'd love t'dance beside Valeriano again...${prompt}
  12096: Here, take this. Ye deserve it fer all yer hard work.${prompt}
  12097: Dance can be illusive at times--the harder ye seek, the more ye lose sight o' it...${prompt}
  12098: When that happens, just clear all unnecessary thoughts from ye mind an' ev'rythin' will be alright.${prompt}
  12099: I will strrrive to become a great dancer like Laila.${prompt}
  12100: Golly! I can't remember the last time I enjoyed myself so much!${prompt}
  12101: |-
    You're so pretty!
    I wanna be a dancer like you someday!${prompt}
  12102: I remember a time during the Crystal War when I found myself surrounded by the enemy in battle. I had given up all hope when Field Musician dancers came to my rescue.${prompt}
  12103: With little more than a graceful wave of their arms, my wounds were healed and pains soothed. It felt as though the Goddess herself had descended from her celestial realm...${prompt}
  12104: |-
    The performance was touching beyond words.
    I have not a shred of doubt in my heart that the Divinity of Dance exists...${prompt}
  12105: Practicin' hard as usual, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  12106: 'I''ve been meanin'' to ask ye, have ye ever heard of ${item-plural: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  12107: They're marks that the Divinity o' Dance bestows t'dancers who are deemed worthy.${prompt}
  12108: Ye've traveled through many a land durin' yer trainin' t'become a dancer.${prompt}
  12109: 'If ye retrace yer steps, the Divinity o'' Dance may appear before ye an'' present ye with ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  12110: 'If that ever happens, bring the ${item-singular: 0[2]} back here an'' show me.${prompt}'
  12111: 'Got yerself ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ye say? Give us a gander.${prompt}'
  12112: There's no mistakin', this is the real McCoy...${prompt}
  12113: This means the Divinity o' Dance has deemed ye worthy. Ye've earned the right t'undertake the test t'become Diva o' the Dance Troupe.${prompt}
  12114: It's a title given t'dancers who are blessed by the Divinity o' Dance. The catch is, there can be no more than one such dancer in a troupe.${prompt}
  12115: Ye can now challenge t'become Troupe Brilioth's “diva.”${prompt}
  12116: Who's gonna test ye? Why, that'll be yers truly, of course. I never imagined this day would come.${prompt}
  12117: In our martial style, there's no better way t'test one's ability than t'go head-to-head. But don't ye think I'll be holdin' back, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12118: We'll duke it out at Qu'Bia Arena. Ye ready to go?${prompt}
  12119: |-
    Go to Qu'Bia Arena?
    ${selection-lines}
    Ready when you are!
    I need time to prepare...${prompt}

  12121: 'Good. When ye arrive, use yer ${item-singular: 0[2]} t''enter the arena.${prompt}'
  12122: 'Your ${item-singular: 0[2]} is torn...${prompt}'
  12123: Yer destiny is t'seek out bigger stages until ye one day become diva to the whole o' Vana'diel.${prompt}
  12124: Prrromise me you'll come back to dance with us again, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12125: "“Diva of the Dance Troupe”... \nIt sounds so dreamy... <Sigh>${prompt}"
  12126: Oh hey there, ${name-player}. I was wondering where you were.${prompt}
  12127: "I've been meaning to have a heart-to-heart with you for some time now. \nDon't take this the wrong way, but...have you ever considered getting a tailor-made dancer outfit? Hmmm?${prompt}"
  12128: "As professionals, we have to take extra care with our appearance, you know. \nAnd it just so happens that there's this tailor I know you'd just love!${prompt}"
  12129: His name is Matthias. The garments he makes at his shop in Bastok Markets are simply sublime!${prompt}
  12130: 'We''ve all had our outfits made up by Matthias, even the ${item-singular: 0[2]} Laila''s wearing. Just gorgeous, aren''t they?${prompt}'
  12131: You should definitely have Matthias make you an outfit, too. I promise you won't regret it!${prompt}

    It's as though...the Divinity of Dance is among us...${prompt}
  12135: You a fan of the dance as well, then?${prompt}
  12136: |-
    Don't get me wrong, the dance shows that are put on nowadays are all well and good.
    But they're nothing compared to the shows of old, back in the days when dance was in its prime!${prompt}

    You ever hear of Troupe Mayakov?
    They were one of the more popular dance troupes making the rounds about the time of the Crystal War.${prompt}
  12138: |-
    They had a young girl amongst them. Absolutely beautiful thing. The “Moonshade Butterfly,” they called her.
    They are still talking in San d'Oria today about the solo performance she gave in Lion Square all those years ago.${prompt}
  12139: |-
    I was lucky enough to get hold of a ticket for that show.
    Got all the way to the tavern before my wife managed to track me down and drag me back home.${prompt}

    What's that?
    Oh, Dom Kupeliaure is the MHMU representative in charge of administering all Mog House-related affairs.
    A most charming and charitable chap, kupo!${prompt}
  12362: |-
    That's odd, though...
    He always struck me as a bit more...literate?${prompt}
  12363: |-
    Then again, he is a busy moogle.
    Contracts to sign, inspections to oversee, deadbeat adventurers to evict...
    You know how it is, kupo. Perhaps he was just in a hurry?${prompt}
  12364: Anyway, let's take a swift survey of the area, shall we?${prompt}

    I'm afraid it's just as I feared, kupo.

    First, let's take care of this gaping gash in the ceiling.
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]} should do the trick, don't you think?${prompt}
  12368: |-
    An adventurer with your mining mastery should be able to find it in a flash, kupo!
    You wouldn't object to obtaining it for me, would you?${prompt}
  12369: |-
    While you're out, I'll take up my tools and get cracking.
    Happy hunting!${prompt}
  12370: Yes, Master?${prompt}
  12371: |-
    I'm all tied up making repairs at the moment.
    Do forgive me, kupo!${prompt}

    Now all it'll take is a tippity-tap here, a nudgety-nudge there, and...${prompt}
  12376: |-
    There! And sublimely done, if I do say so myself.

  12378: |-
    Phew! That'll do it.
    Truly, I'm shocked--stupefied, even--that our union-run Mog Houses are in a state of such disrepair!
    Something must be done...and soon, kupo!${prompt}
  12379: I know! I'll talk to Dom Kupeliaure!${prompt}
  12380: |-
    Knowing him, he'll fix these right up into lavish three-bedroom suites fit for King Kupofried himself!
    That's just the magnanimous moogle he is, kupo.${prompt}
  12381: |-
    Just leave it to me! I'll draft up an official renovation request.
    Why, we'll be living in the lap of luxury before you know it, kupo!${prompt}

  12383: |-
    Yes, yes...
    Why, it looks as if we're just about--${prompt}

    One last piece of material to put on the critical coup-de-grace!

    What's that, Master?
    Why, of course it's required for the repairs!
    Whatever are you insinuating, kupo!?${prompt}
  12387: |-
    I wouldn't dream of roasting it medium-rare, glazed with a delectable dragon-fruit-and-rolanberry sauce, and serving it on a romantic candlelit dinner date with my darling Kupiruru!
    That's the furthest thing from my innocent moogle mind!
    Please, Master! You're the only one who can save my romantic prospects--I mean, this dilapidated dwelling, kupo!${prompt}
  12388: |-
    ...and that should do it! Feast your eyes on this craftsmanship, Master!
    The precision! The perfection! Not a single bent nail! Not a single warped plank!${prompt}

    Could the stress of dealing with disgruntled boarders be getting to him in his advanced age, kupo?${prompt}

    It seems we have a sticky situation on our hands...

  12641: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  12642: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  12643: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  12644: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  12645: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  12646: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  12647: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  12648: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  12649: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  12650: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  12651: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  12652: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  12653: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  12654: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  12655: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  12656: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  12657: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  12658: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  12659: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  12660: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  12661: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  12662: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  12663: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  12664: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  12665: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  12666: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  12667: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  12668: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  12669: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  12670: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  12671: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  12672: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  12673: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  12674: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  12675: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  12676: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  12677: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  12678: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  12679: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  12680: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  12681: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  12682: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  12683: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  12684: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  12685: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  12686: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  12687: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  12688: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  12689: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  12690: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  12691: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  12692: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  12693: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  12694: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  12695: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  12696: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  12697: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  12698: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  12699: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12700: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  12701: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  12702: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  12703: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  12704: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  12705: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  12706: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  12707: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  12708: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  12709: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  12710: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  12711: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  12712: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  12713: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  12714: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  12715: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  12716: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  12717: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  12718: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  12719: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  12720: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?
    Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  12721: |-
    A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know.

    ...Alas.
    It's a shame, but it appears your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be etched.${prompt}

    I thought you'd never ask!
    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  12741: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  12742: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'
  12743: |-
    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  12744: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  12745: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  12746: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  12747: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  12748: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  12749: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}

    Why, you! Don't play coy with me, ${name-player}.
    You know verrry well what I'm talking about!${prompt}
  13071: I have something for you, courtesy of that mangy moogle we've all grrrown to love.${prompt}
  13072: And how inexplicably convenient; I swear your comrrrade can sniff out adventure from fifty malms away.${prompt}
  13073: |-
    When you plod through the same motions three times, it's not hard to find a pattern to them.
    I suppose I'll be off to the Ru'Lude Gardens now, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13074: |-
    My ol' adventurer's intuition has never steered me wrong before, and it told me to come here at this very moment!
    Let's be off, ${name-player}! I can already hear an adventurous etude playing for us in Ru'Lude.${prompt}
  13075: |-
    There is no need for surprise; this will be our fourth undertaking, after all.
    So, shall we be on our way shortly, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13076: |-
    I simply analyzed the data available from our three previous exploits and concluded that ${name-player} would arrive around this time.
    Let us make haste for the gardens before the Mooglehood feels slighted by our tardiness.${prompt}
  13077: |-
    We've done this more times than I can count, Luto! Of course I know when and where my mentor will show up!
    Are you ready, ${name-player}? I'm ready! Ru'Lude ho!${prompt}
  13078: |-
    “The fourth time's the charm,” I always say. I must admit, though, I am a bit surprised as well.
    At any rate, will you be ready to depart soon, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13079: |-
    I may very well know ${name-player} better than ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] knows ${choice-player-gender}[himself/herself] after our various outings together, so ascertaining ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] location was no trouble at all.
    Anyway, I am ready whenever you are, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13080: |-
    I had an inkling that today would be the day, and lo and behold, it is! I'm so lucky!
    Or maybe it's because ${name-player} and I have already journeyed together so often?${prompt}
  13081: |-
    Such acumen may very well be thanks to the bonds we have forged together in battle, Luto.
    ${name-player}, I am at your service. Might I suggest we first make our way to the Ru'Lude Gardens?${prompt}
  13082: |-
    Maybe doing all these trials in tandewhatsit has bestowed us with some magical connective powers?
    I don't know why, but I just had a feeling that ${name-player} would be here today. Gee, I'm so glad I listened to that hunch!${prompt}
  13083: |-
    This ability--if it can even be called that--is merely the byproduct of our shared experiences.
    ${name-player}, I shall expend my utmost effort in this new trial. I trust you will do the same as well.${prompt}
  13084: |-
    This will be our fourth trial in tandem. I did not get this far by ignoring ${name-player}'s behavior.

    You do not deserve this, Luto.

    I cannot adequately express the depth of my remorse.

    My sincerest apologies, Luto.
    I never once considered the bind in which my failures would entrap you...${prompt}

    How unbecoming of me.
    I am supposed to help contribute to your business, yet I cannot even do that...${prompt}
  13102: |-
    I feel so immensely terrible, Luto!
    Never in my wildest dreams did I mean to inflict such misery upon you!${prompt}

    I cannot help but feel responsible for this.
    You can place all the blame on me and my shortcomings as an adventurer.${prompt}

    What can I do to make things better!? I'll do everything within my power to help you!${prompt}

  13107: Cut the histrrrionics! Are you an adventurer or some mewling kitten!?${prompt}
  13108: Keep your chin up and concentrate on your trrrial. I don't want to get your fur all in knots before you even start, so let's just forget I said anything, okay?${prompt}

  13110: |-
    And when they do, I'll make sure to tuck it away until you're done training.

  13126: |-
    Oh ho. I see you're still both in one piece. Congratulations then on your trrriumph.
    How do you feel? Have you noticed any changes since your departure?${prompt}
  13127: |-
    As tedious as these trials are, I think I'm ready for another. Why, this is the strongest I've felt since I kicked that little...
    No, I'd best not say any more.${prompt}
  13128: Now I'm light as a cloud and tough as a tree! My hands can hit what even my eyes don't see!${prompt}
  13129: I'm not half bad. I wager I could go one-on-one with the Shadow Lord and barely even break a sweat.${prompt}
  13130: I feel quite empowered, thank you. All my senses seem heightened to the point where, for a fleeting moment, I almost questioned my mortality.${prompt}
  13131: What can I say? I'm ready to sink my teeth deep into the next job and tear off a chunk of absolute victory!${prompt}
  13132: |-
    I feel good enough to ask you out to dinner with me next week.
    Stay that thought! I'm not sure you're ready for me yet, my dear.${prompt}
  13133: This is a wonderful feeling. I am quite sure that were I to gaze into a mirror, all my senses as well as my face would be given point.${prompt}
  13134: I've never felt anything like this! I could take on all the evil in Vana'diel and emerge unscathed, to say nothing of your next task for me!${prompt}
  13135: This is a splendid feeling indeed. A simple wave of my hand seems sufficient to accomplish even the most arduous of tasks.${prompt}
  13136: |-
    This feeling is the best! It's like I huffed and puffed and blew down a wall that was blocking me!
    Now, what would you call that? A boundary bust, maybe?${prompt}
  13137: What a spectacular sensation. I can feel an unbelievable power welling up from the very depths of my being, surging through my limbs...${prompt}
  13138: I feel like I could claim all the world with a swift stroke of martial justice that's been sharpened upon my newly heightened senses.${prompt}
  13139: It's good to see you're enjoying your powerrrs.${prompt}
  13140: |-
    And while I'd like to rrreward your vim with an equally vigorous assignment, I don't have any right now.
    As I'm out of other ideas, why not continue training with ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13141: I suppose if there's nothing better to do...${prompt}
  13142: You won't be sorry, Luto. I promise to be so valiant that you'll hear minstrels singing my praises before I even return!${prompt}
  13143: If that's how it is, that's how it is. I have no qualms with more training.${prompt}
  13144: As long as you suggest such a course of action, Luto, I shall heed your sage advice.${prompt}
  13145: |-
    You're abso-truly-complelutely fine with me training some more!?
    You're the greatest, Luto!${prompt}
  13146: How do you always know exactly what to say to me, Luto? A purrrfect response, if I do say so myself.${prompt}
  13147: That would be simply divine! What a wonderful idea, Luto.${prompt}
  13148: |-
    Really!? Can I!?
    Then I'm going slay so many monsters that I'll forget why I'm slaying them in the first place!${prompt}
  13149: You are more than kind, Luto, and I shall avail myself of your generous offer.${prompt}
  13150: |-
    They say faith makes you stronger, and I have crates of faith in both you and ${name-player}!
    A little more training and I should be almost invincible!${prompt}
  13151: I shan't question your acumen, Luto. If that is what you suggest, I shall devote myself to training as thoroughly as possible.${prompt}
  13152: |-
    Is that your consent I hear?
    Then ${name-player} and I shall form an army of two, leaving nothing but a wake of utter destruction in our path.${prompt}
  13153: Don't pull any punches, either. I think it'd be the cat's meow if you come back even strrronger.${prompt}
  13154: The same goes for you, ${name-player}. You wouldn't want the disciple to become the masterrr, would you?♪${prompt}
  13155: The faster we depart, the faster we can finish this errand. Therefore, I'll be taking my leave now.${prompt}
  13156: I'll forge the way for us, ${name-player}! Just make sure you don't fall too far behind!${prompt}
  13157: I'll take the lead on this one and let you bring up the rear, ${name-player}. Rendezvous with me when you're able.${prompt}
  13158: |-
    I beg your leave.
    I apologize for my early departure, ${name-player}, but I shan't be too far ahead.${prompt}
  13159: I'm going to run on ahead, ${name-player}. Catch up with me if you can!${prompt}
  13160: |-
    Well, ${name-player}, I'm going on ahead. Just call my name if you find yourself in trouble.
    ...And here's looking at you, Luto. You're welcome to join us anytime.${prompt}
  13161: Well, I'm off. Remember, ${name-player}, no dilly-dallying. Finish what you have to do, then hurry right along.${prompt}
  13162: |-
    I can barely contain myself. I mean I can't contain myself at all!
    You better not linger long, ${name-player}, or there won't be any monsters left for you to practice on!${prompt}
  13163: |-
    And this is where I take my leave.
    Should you require my presence, ${name-player}, simply say the word and it shall take me mere moments to appear at your side.${prompt}
  13164: |-
    I'm going to leave now so I can start training right away.
    You're going to be so proud of me, ${name-player}. I just know it!${prompt}
  13165: |-
    Please excuse me, I must be going now.
    If you would be so kind as to let me know when you leave, ${name-player}, I would be extremely appreciative.${prompt}
  13166: "Good-bye, Luto. \nAnd ${name-player}, if you don't make haste after your conversation's finished, the consequences will be...how should I say...excruciating?\nBwahaha!${prompt}"
  13167: Hmmm. I should prrrobably get this business back up and running soon.${prompt}
  13168: I realize that capable adventurers like you and your friend won't stay satisfied with trrraining missions forever, now, will you?${prompt}
  13169: Maybe my old scrrratching post will help me come up with some good ideas to get back on track.${prompt}
  13170: Anyway, get out there and rrraise hell, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  13171: "I knew you'd be back, ${name-player}. \nYou seem to sense exactly when I'm in the mood for your special serrrvices.${prompt}"

    Oh, you. Stop prrretending to be such a kitten.

    Your whiskers really told you that, Luto? Because I came here after my adventurer's sense began tingling!
    We're so alike that we should start a business together! One where I get to do real jobs and not just train all the time!${prompt}

    Your mental acuity is most laudable, Luto. I expected nothing less from my employer.

    It's time once again for a trial in tandem, is it?
    Of course, I'm completely fine with undertaking this task so crucial to my own development, but--if I may--it does seem a tad suspicious that we never actually receive any job offers.${prompt}

    This is just the chance I need to prove how dashing and daring I can be. Be forewarned, Luto, lest you fall so hard for me that you can't get back up.

  13270: |-
    Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!

    No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”
    Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt}

  13311: They're easily manipulated, though, and the Moblins have taken advantage of that. They put the Meebles to work throughout a network of burrows.${prompt}
  13312: |-
    Meeble Burrows may be a quaint name, but what sort of fiends lurk amongst these dank caverns? Why are the Moblins making Meebles do their dirty work? And how large are these underground tunnels anyway?
    Maybe we haven't learned as much about the Meebles and their habitat as we thought...${prompt}
  13313: |-
    Wait...if you don't mind crawling through caves and dirtying your own hands for a good cause, how about joining in the exploration?
    We could use another pair of eyes down there. Just talk to me when you decide you'd like to help the scientific community.${prompt}
  13314: |-
    Oho, I knew it was a good idea to prepare this grimoire.
    Here, it should help with your research.${prompt}
  13315: It looks like you can't carry any more. Try emptying some articles out and return when you have the room.${prompt}
  13316: |-
    Hahaha, you look like you've just been thrown from a chocobo!
    No need to be scared. I'll explain the process as best I can, but feel free to ask if I've missed something.${prompt}
  13317: |-
    Let's see if I can do this. First, form a party of one to six people.
    Next, trade your grimoire to the Burrow Researcher in charge of the burrows you're investigating.${prompt}
  13318: If the need arises, I can always transport you there.${prompt}
  13319: |-
    Alright, here goes nothing. First, form a party of one to six people.
    Next, trade your grimoire to me.${prompt}
  13320: |-
    ${choice: 0}[You'll receive/I'll give you/I'll give you] ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} and ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} once you hand it over.
    After that's done, you're ready to go spelunking...unless you're the party leader.${prompt}
  13321: 'Then you''ll have to talk to ${choice: 0}[the Burrow Researcher/me/me] again to decide which expedition to undertake.${prompt}'
  13322: I must warn you, though, that some expeditions require everyone to make a unanimous decision.${prompt}
  13323: Once your party's expedition has been chosen, it's time to go spelunking.${prompt}
  13324: |-
    Have your party leader talk to the Meeble guarding the burrow entrance.
    He'll escort you to the right research site.${prompt}
  13325: 'After you''ve finished an expedition, use ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to return aboveground and report to ${choice: 0}[the Burrow Researcher in charge or me/me/me] to get your grimoire back.${prompt}'
  13326: |-
    Now for a word about grimoires.
    They impart various benefits depending on what expeditions you've completed.${prompt}
  13327: It's dangerous down there, so be sure to make use of your grimoire.${prompt}
  13328: |-
    Finally, while there are many types of grimoires, they all share the same attributes.
    Feel free to change them out depending on your companions and the research assignment at hand.${prompt}
  13329: You must be the explorer my compatriot in Jeuno was talking about. What brings you here?${prompt}
  13330: "Well, well, look who it is. \nWhat do you need this time?${prompt}"
  13331: Finally! I've been waiting for you this whole time.${prompt}
  13332: We thought we had a bead on the Meebles' habitat, but it turns out we were dead wrong. There's another set of caverns in the vicinity of Batallia Downs!${prompt}
  13333: I can't understand how it remained buried for so long. Reports abound that the Moblins have expanded their base of operations and are employing Meebles for “nefarious deeds” once again.${prompt}
  13334: |-
    Now it's up to us, the Meeble Burrows Exploration Committee, to unearth heaping amounts of knowledge for our glorious archives!
    Oh, and maybe to save the day, too.${prompt}
  13335: How, you ask? By collecting as much information as possible through new expeditions and finally getting to the bottom of this Moblin nuisance! We're always in need of proven researchers like yourself, should you wish to join in the action.${prompt}
  13336: |-
    What do you want to do?
    ${selection-lines}
    Head to the burrows.

    Review expedition specifics.
    Nothing for the nonce.${prompt}
  13338: |-
    Any questions?
    ${selection-lines}
    No, not right now.
    How does this whole research thing work?
    I...descend into underground caves!?
    What are these grimoires about?
    How do I begin an expedition?
    What goes on after an expedition?
    What dastardly foes lurk down below?
    Any rhyme or reason to these burrows?
    What are research marks?
    Can you tell me about the Meebles?
    What is grimoire engraving?
    Could you tell me about wizened worms?
    Palimpsests? Huh?${prompt}
  13339: |-
    You adventurers can help us collect data by embarking on certain expeditions belowground.
    The goals and activities for each journey you undertake will vary, so this won't be just some routine experiment.${prompt}
  13340: |-
    Although these subterranean caverns may appear simplistic from the outside, their twisting corridors disorient even the Moblins.
    Be careful.${prompt}
  13341: Of course, you'll have to prove your problem-solving skills during more forgiving operations before we let you tackle the truly scary stuff.${prompt}
  13342: |-
    Each expedition has a total of three goals for you to achieve. Complete just one goal or up to all three--the choice is yours.
    However, it should go without saying that the more goals you achieve, the better the reward.${prompt}
  13343: Lastly, the caves are no place for a solo adventurer to be traipsing about. We'll need you to travel in groups of three or more.${prompt}
  13344: |-
    Grimoires are types of magical books that ancient sorcerers brandished in battle long, long ago.
    Now that they've been unearthed again, we can use them for our benefit.${prompt}
  13345: |-
    What's the point of adapting them for use in the burrows? Why, to record the feats of explorers like you.
    Without them, it would be much harder to complete expeditions.${prompt}
  13346: |-
    Like I said, they're no picture books for children.
    They grant powerful effects for each expedition you finish.${prompt}
  13347: |-
    These boons pack a punch from the get-go, but completing expeditions also allows you to increase their potency twice!
    See, I'm sure these grimoires will prove useful in your studies of the Meebles' tunnels.${prompt}
  13348: Just to warn you beforehand, though, boons that affect Auto-Reraise and spoils cannot have their potency increased.${prompt}
  13349: |-
    Another catch is that only the effects of your leader's tome may be bestowed upon your party for normal expeditions.
    Hopefully that should be all the firepower you need, though.${prompt}
  13350: 'At the moment we only have ${number: 0} types of grimoires available, but we do plan on adding to that number eventually.${prompt}'
  13351: When you want to start a new expedition, just hand over your grimoire to the Burrow Researcher in charge of the burrows you're investigating.${prompt}
  13352: When you want to start a new expedition, just hand over your grimoire to me.${prompt}
  13353: 'Once you do that, ${choice: 0}[he''ll/I''ll/I''ll] dole out ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} and ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  13354: Those're the only supplies you'll need to start spelunking, but not so fast. You first have to decide what expedition you'll undertake.${prompt}
  13355: I'll help you make the necessary preparations for that based on your grimoire's records.${prompt}
  13356: |-
    It may seem like a lot to handle, but there's no need to start shaking in your boots.
    The Burrow Researcher in charge of the burrows you're investigating will help you make all the necessary preparations for that based on your grimoire's records.${prompt}
  13357: Only then can your party leader declare which journey you and your companions shall embark upon.${prompt}
  13358: 'It may smack of red tape, but you can only embark upon expedition #1 of each rank at first. At least you''re allowed to choose any expedition you''ve already proven your worth on.${prompt}'
  13359: Oh, and before I forget--for particularly grueling endeavors, everyone must sign up individually. The higher-ups like to think of it as “exonerating the committee from responsibility” or something I don't understand.${prompt}
  13360: 'After signing up, you''ll <cough> almost <cough> be ready to set off. The thing is...Meebles${choice: 0}[/, like that one over there,/, like that one over there,] roam the mouth of the burrows.${prompt}'
  13361: They don't trust anyone but the Moblins, so you'll have to dance like Moblins, prance like Moblins, and even romance like Moblins to gain access to the caves.${prompt}
  13362: |-
    ...Actually, you'll only need to stink like Moblins.
    I can give you ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} in exchange for a grimoire to make sure you smell the part.${prompt}
  13363: |-
    Don't worry, this method is tried and true.
    Meebles have very bad eyesight, so they mostly use their sense of smell to determine who's who.${prompt}
  13364: 'That sense of smell, however, is unrivaled. Even if you''re the only one who isn''t carrying ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}, they''ll sniff you out in an instant.${prompt}'
  13365: In fact, the only reason I haven't been turned into Galka gristle after standing here so long is because I keep one on me at all times.${prompt}
  13366: 'Once the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} does its thing and the Meebles take you down into their burrows, you''re free to experiment all you want.${prompt}'
  13367: '...Oh, but if you ever let enthusiasm get the best of you and forget your objectives, just use ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} to remind yourself.${prompt}'
  13368: There should be Speleological Handbooks secretly placed by our members all over the burrows.${prompt}
  13369: 'Holding your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} up to one should do the trick.${prompt}'
  13370: They can also serve as a way to record your underground activities.${prompt}
  13371: Once you finish an expedition, any information you record will have to be reflected in your grimoire.${prompt}
  13372: 'You''ll be given ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} after completing an expedition.${prompt}'
  13373: 'One puff on your ${item-singular: 1[2]} will allow your whole posse to climb back aboveground.${prompt}'
  13374: 'After making your escape, there''s only one thing left to do. Pay a visit to either the appropriate Burrow Researcher or me and show him your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  13375: 'After making your escape, you can show your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} to me.${prompt}'
  13376: '${choice: 0}[One of us will/I''ll/I''ll] reference the data you''ve collected and catalog it in your grimoire.${prompt}'
  13377: 'If you ever need to escape before completing an expedition, though, you can always use ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} instead.${prompt}'
  13378: |-
    Sadly, using ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} allows only its bearer to come up for air.
    Don't forget to show your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} once you exit, even if you've bowed out midway through.${prompt}
  13379: |-
    There's nothing wrong with leaving in the middle of an expedition.
    You'll never be penalized for it, as we wouldn't want to weaken your adventuring spirit.${prompt}
  13380: 'Oh, and if you''ve been wondering how to get ahold of one of these ${item-plural: 3[2]}, you''ll get one from the Meeble guarding the entrance.${prompt}'
  13381: |-
    Some scary, twisted fiends roam the depths of these caverns...at least that's what our scouts who come back alive tell me.
    Of course, you'll likely come face-to-face with these nightmares, too.${prompt}
  13382: |-
    Why? Well, because you'll be tasked with culling one of them after completing the first four expeditions in a course.
    That's why.${prompt}
  13383: Whether you choose to accept such a dangerous mission is all up to you. However, keep this in mind.${prompt}
  13384: Accepting such an assignment means you'll never get back any grimoires we're holding for you.${prompt}
  13385: |-
    That's right. We'll need to archive all the precious data you've collected.
    Jeuno wasn't built in a day, and the same goes for our analysis of Meeble Burrows.${prompt}
  13386: Oh, I almost forgot. For extremely harrowing journeys such as these, everyone must sign up individually.${prompt}
  13387: This way we can be absolutely sure that everyone's prepared for the task at hand. We wouldn't want people without enough experience getting hurt down there.${prompt}
  13388: In return for your cooperation (or to make sure you truly survive), I'll bestow on your whole party the boons everyone has received up until now.${prompt}
  13389: This way you'll all be at your best to face the worst...in the name of science!${prompt}
  13390: This may seem obvious, but you can't just mull around all you want down there.${prompt}
  13391: 'Even if you can use ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to confuse the Meebles, they aren''t stupid enough to ignore you forever.${prompt}'
  13392: |-
    That's why we've set a ${number: 2}-minute limit per expedition (Earth time).
    We want to limit the number of casualties to as few as possible. Safety first, that's our motto.${prompt}
  13393: 'You should also know that we only give out one ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} every ${number: 1} ${choice: 3}[hour/minute]${choice-plurality: 1}[/s] (Earth time).${prompt}'
  13394: |-
    We do want you to be the best researcher you can be, though...
    How about we give you ${number: 3} ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} as a first-time offer? That way you can learn the ropes faster.${prompt}
  13395: It took us a while to realize, but the health of our explorers started failing after they'd carry multiple pouches for long periods of time.${prompt}
  13396: |-
    On the bright side, I'm bound by the Meeble Burrows Exploration Committee code to keep up to ${number: 3} of them for you.
    Don't ask why the pouches don't affect me. And if you make a joke about my mother being a Moblin...${prompt}
  13397: |-
    I may be haler and heartier than the average Galka, but there's only so much of that stench I can take.
    If you need more pouches than I can carry, you'd better get yourself a pherobarrier box.${prompt}
  13398: Mind if I change to a fairer smelling subject now?${prompt}
  13399: 'In the event that the spirits haunting these caverns disallow one of your brethren entry, just return aboveground within three minutes without completing any objectives. You''ll be refunded your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} at no cost!${prompt}'
  13400: How nice of the committee, right? Now you don't have to burst a blood vessel if something happens during your descent.${prompt}
  13401: We may have many limits and regulations, but we're not heartless. We also dole out “research marks” to those who help us learn about Meeble Burrows.${prompt}
  13402: |-
    How do you get them? It's simple.
    The more you accomplish down there, the more marks you receive. You can also turn in marks for certain items and equipment.${prompt}
  13403: |-
    There's no need to be a forlorn funguar, either.
    The more fellow researchers on your expedition, the more marks you reap. “The more the merrier” has never rung more true!${prompt}
  13404: Our results suggest that Meebles are rather docile creatures, with little if any culture to speak of. They shouldn't pose much of a threat.${prompt}
  13405: They're easily manipulated, though, and the Moblins have taken advantage of that. They put the Meebles to work in caverns all over the realm.${prompt}
  13406: |-
    Meeble Burrows may be a quaint name, but what sort of fiends lurk amongst these dank caverns? Why are the Moblins making Meebles do their dirty work? And how large are these underground tunnels anyway?
    Maybe we haven't learned as much about the Meebles and their habitat as we thought...${prompt}
  13407: |-
    Wait...if you don't mind crawling through caves and dirtying your own hands for a good cause, how about joining in the exploration?
    We could use another pair of eyes down there. Just talk to me when you decide you'd like to help the scientific community.${prompt}
  13408: I'm sure I don't have to lecture you on receiving certain boons from your grimoire depending on the expeditions you've completed.${prompt}
  13409: But you do remember that boons from one grimoire can't be applied to another, right?${prompt}
  13410: Even worse, you build a relationship with your grimoire only to have it stolen away from you by some unfeeling bookworms right before you set off to slay the most fearsome of monsters!${prompt}
  13411: Well, even if you don't remember, those days are long gone! That's the wonderful thing about science--it progresses!${prompt}
  13412: We've identified unique arcane essences that are released with the completion of some goals and imbue the ink of our pens as we record your exploits.${prompt}
  13413: |-
    Using these essences, we can reconstruct the boons you've received from your grimoire records.
    Let me explain.${prompt}
  13414: 'If you had completed Adjunct Expedition #1, we could inscribe the boons from that expedition onto a blank grimoire.${prompt}'
  13415: Of course the boon would be the same as the one granted from completing that expedition...except for the fact that we can only inscribe level one boons into grimoires. Sorry, but the process is not yet perfect.${prompt}
  13416: |-
    Want to know what else isn't perfect? These inscriptions aren't free.
    It's sad, but grimoires and pheromone sacks don't sprout from the ground, you know!${prompt}
  13417: Meebles use their long sniffers to snuff up odds and ends from the burrow floor.${prompt}
  13418: According to our latest scouting report, they dredged up some things called... Give me a minute here...${prompt}
  13419: |-
    Palimpsests?
    I may not have the biggest brain this side of the Sea of Shu'Meyo, but I do know that these papers are some powerful stuff.${prompt}
  13420: The MBEC now also gives away wizened worms to adventurers who complete objectives.${prompt}
  13421: |-
    Meebles love their wizened worms, and how.
    Quite a non sequitur I pulled on you, right?${prompt}
  13422: |-
    Except it's not!
    Give the Meebles that guard the burrow entrances some of those water-starved wrigglers and they'll give you stuff in return...possibly even some parades...sorry, palisades...uh, palimpsests.${prompt}
  13423: |-
    Ridiculous name, I know. I can barely say it.
    These palimpsests are types of magical paper that temporarily aid everyone in your troop.${prompt}
  13424: All you need to do is trade it to the grimoire inside the caverns and you're good to go.${prompt}
  13425: I haven't been able to use it myself yet, so this might not be true. Still, a friend of a friend told me that while each piece of parchment has three possible effects, you can only choose one!${prompt}
  13426: Don't worry, he assures me that you can choose your desired effect through the wonders of that grimoire down there.${prompt}
  13427: If you want the beat-'em-up power of all three effects, though, you'll need to gather three pieces of parchment.${prompt}

  13722: '...and in those hollows I''ve left some of our erstwhile companions'' favorite treats for you to give to her. If you''ll forgive the saying--you''ll have her eating out of your hands.${prompt}'
  13723: But eight spots is a trifle much, hmm? So let's cut it down-wown to five. That should be enough to make her cuddle up to you like a puppy.${prompt}
  13724: And when you're done with that, I need you to go over here.${prompt}
  13725: My good friend Syrillia will be waiting for you to return that raptor-waptor.${prompt}
  13726: '${choice: 2}[Like I just said,/You may recall that] sometimes our friend here can be...less than cooperative.${prompt}'

  13736: Don't give me that dirty look--this one is a bit more docile than the one I had you take around Batallia Downs.${prompt}
  13737: To ride a mount, just select “Mount” from the “Abilities” submenu.${prompt}
  13738: 'Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is a bit special, because it can produce all manner of lovely sounds.${prompt}'
  13739: 'If you come across ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} in your travels, would you mind showing it to me? I can register it in your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'

  13761: Anyways... What do you want to ride?${prompt}
  13762: Ah, an excellent choice.${prompt}

  13764: Flying mounts are great, aren't they?${prompt}

  13767: Oh! The stethoscope is almost finished. I think...${prompt}
  13768: Ah, let me guess. He was talking about flying mounts-wounts again, wasn't he?${prompt}

  13774: '...${prompt}'
  13775: Fine. How about you aim to be an airship pilotaru then?${prompt}
  13776: Airships are fine and all, but I'd rather fly through the sky like a bird.${prompt}
  13777: I suppose I've got no choice but to make something myself. It'll be a mount that is so stable even I'll be able to ride it!${prompt}
  13778: Okay, I just need to sneak into the Grand Duke Palace and borrow a set of airship blueprints.${prompt}
  13779: Hey, you'll help me, won't you?${prompt}
  13780: W-wait just a momentaru!${prompt}
  13781: I'm just joking. The blueprints won't do me any good without some kind of engine. That's the one thing that I can't make by myself.${prompt}

  13783: Maybe it's up above the sky? Or perhaps...${prompt}
  13784: Get back to fixing-wixing that stethoscope already!${prompt}
  13785: I know how he seems, but Jeridade is quite capable-wapable and super smart too, so I imagine if he had the materials, he could probably make a flying mount.${prompt}

  13808: Umm... Wh-when you put it like that... I don't know.${prompt}
  13809: 'Oh, I got it! Maybe you could go to ${unknown: 0x01053782CC8180} and search for clues for me?${prompt}'

  13821: Get ready to take off!${prompt}
  13822: Huh!? The chocobos! Waitaru!
  13823: I made a slight mistake with the tuning. Here, I'll fix it right away.${prompt}
  13824: There, it should be fine now.${prompt}
  13825: Well? Care to give it a try?${prompt}
  13826: (I'd be scared too if I were you...)${prompt}
  13827: Alright! It worked!${prompt}
  13828: Okay now, I want you to use it.${prompt}
  13829: I thoughtaru you were making this for yourself, Jeridade.${prompt}
  13830: This Levitus... Oh, that seems to be this mount's name. It's carved into the seat.${prompt}
  13831: Anyways, I'll make my own once I develop a new engine. I think I can use the old one for reference.${prompt}
  13832: Now then... I need to go out and get some parts.${prompt}
  13833: Jeridade! What's got you all excited now!?${prompt}
  13834: Hey! Stop! Don't you run away from me!${prompt}

  13840: Hmm... What is the meaning of this...${prompt}

  13922: I must admit that my mental health has taken a turn for the better knowing I can count on you to handle this issue.${prompt}
  13923: I must remain resolute, for it will not be much longer before my plans come to full fruition.${prompt}
  13924: But I am vexed that my comrades--my lord's right-hand troops--have been lax in their reporting of late.${prompt}
  13925: Doubtless they have their hands full. May the will of my lord be done.${prompt}
  13926: Goddesspeed, hero.${prompt}
  13927: Why won't the dead just stay dead? This goes against all our calculations.${prompt}
  13928: Perhaps they fear my lord's wrath and deemed their chances best on this side of the veil.${prompt}
  13929: Ah, my erstwhile friend! You couldn't have arrived at a more fortuitous time.${prompt}
  13930: At risk of sounding like a broken orchestrion, I confess that I require your assistance once more.${prompt}
  13931: I had been under the impression that the dead were set on returning here, to the world of the living--but it appears I was mistaken.${prompt}
  13932: What their true aim is remains yet a mystery, but one thing is certain--their leader possesses an immense power that defies expectations. Their plans must not be allowed to succeed.${prompt}
  13933: I say this not to diminish the vast capabilities of my master, but to demonstrate to you the commitment of my colleagues and I to ensuring that their machinations bear no fruit.${prompt}
  13934: Yet as the field of battle expands, our forces find themselves stretched increasingly thin. Even my master is vexed at where best to concentrate our efforts.${prompt}
  13935: And so my master created--employed--new soldiers to aid in the efforts. Prompt though their reports were, I found the content thereof to be impudent at best.${prompt}
  13936: “Stop yapping and clean up the stragglers. Those are your orders, and you'd best follow them.”${prompt}
  13937: The audacity! Whether they are right or not is immaterial--their tone is completely unaccpetable.${prompt}
  13938: Ugh. To think they get to me so easily...${prompt}
  13939: The will of my master is paramount. If we are to clean up the “stragglers,” then so be it.${prompt}
  13940: I will fill my charge without fail.${prompt}
  13941: I have taken the liberty of preparing a list of your next targets.${prompt}
  13942: Though information on previous marks was collected by my underlings, this time I have taken it upon myself to collate the necessary materials.${prompt}
  13943: Fear not. It is as accurate as the previous entries. I take my job quite seriously.${prompt}
  13944: It remains to be seen why our foes are mustering their forces here in Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13945: Ah, but you fancy yourself a defender of Vana'diel, do you not? How quaint.${prompt}
  13946: I wish you the best of luck.${prompt}
  13947: What is this? You wish to know if I'm familiar with a black-clad Goblin?${prompt}
  13948: Yes, I have had the displeasure. A more uncouth specimen I have never come across.${prompt}
  13949: But if you're going to wallow in the mud like a pig, then it was only appropriate that I gave them an appropriate porcine companion...so I introduced them to Shami.${prompt}
  13950: Pleasure to see you, ${name-player}. How are those two pig-headed buffoons doing?${prompt}
  13951: “What buffoons?” Why, Shami and Shemo, of course.${prompt}
  13952: I sent them that accursed Goblin and their accompanying retinue. Filth loves its own kind.${prompt}
  13953: Hahaha... Tell me how that turned out?${prompt}
  13954: Wh-what? Not only were the Goblin team not there, but then Duke Alloces...?${prompt}
  13955: But if the gate is closed, then it stands to reason that Duke Alloces shouldn't even be here!${prompt}
  13956: Ugh. This is why you can never trust anything to a low-level demon.${prompt}
  13957: |-
    But setting that small matter aside...
    You are after more information on the World Eater Egg, are you not?${prompt}
  13958: You must wonder what this means for the baneful dead.${prompt}
  13959: Worry not. I have prepared a list of more targets for you.${prompt}
  13960: |-
    Haha...
    Surely each one you banish brings a little bit more peace back to Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13961: Perhaps you have already surmised my true identity, but it is too late for you to turn back now.${prompt}
  13962: After all, the proverbial contract has already been signed.${prompt}
  13963: Hoho...a deal with the devil is not so easily overturned...at least not without paying the ultimate price.${prompt}
  13964: And with what you now know about some of the world's ugly truths, well...${prompt}
  13965: And that lovely retinue who depends on you oh-so-much will surely come through for you in the end.${prompt}
  13966: And of course, my lord Odin is depending on you as well.${prompt}
  13967: And I'm sure none of us want these targets to be in cahoots with Garazu-Horeizu, correct?${prompt}
  13968: Betrayal will be deemed a failure to fulfill the obligations of your contract. Surely I need not say more.${prompt}
  13969: So keep doing what you do best, and there will be no problems.${prompt}
  13970: Ah, and one last thing. If you try to flee, or tell anyone who we really are, it will not end well for you.${prompt}
  13971: This, too, would be an egregious violation of the terms of our little “agreement.”${prompt}
  13972: You see, ${name-player}, we have eyes and ears in every corner of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13973: And we are always watching...listening...${prompt}
  13974: Ah, ${name-player}. Somehow, I knew you would come.${prompt}
  13975: The sealing of the gate has been quite the catalyst. Wouldn't you agree?${prompt}
  13976: My understanding is that you are working together with Skokkr to reforge the Prime Weapons, are you not?${prompt}
  13977: My understanding is that you have worked together with Skokkr and succeeded in reforging a Prime Weapon, have you not?${prompt}
  13978: I wish you all the best in your journey to vanquish Chaos. After all, the Prime Weapons are the keys.${prompt}
  13979: Your Prime Weapon holds the key to besting Chaos, as you doubtless already know.${prompt}
  13980: 'But I would advise you one thing: the Prime Weapons belong to my master, and my master alone.${prompt}'
  13981: And when they return to him, I have no doubt that they will make their way into my hands...as my just reward for all I have accomplished.${prompt}
  13982: Oh, yes. The time for me to wield the Prime Weapons is close at hand.${prompt}
  13983: In fact, this puts me in the mood for a rousing tale. A secondhand tale, so I leave the analysis of its veracity to you.${prompt}
  13984: 5000 years ago, the Prime Weapons were made manifest after an eternity of trial and error.${prompt}
  13985: Those in charge searched endlessly for a way to figure out how to stop Chaos from devouring the astral plane.${prompt}
  13986: Of course, that was eons ago, so the exact time frame isn't clear, but I am led to believe that over one hundred years of effort were poured into this endeavor.${prompt}
  13987: It started with research into souls that hungered for more. A contract between them was established.${prompt}
  13988: But those initial results were...disappointing. More pure souls were required.${prompt}
  13989: I need not spell out for you what that implied.${prompt}
  13990: Many souls were snuffed out on the altar of progress, irrevocably removed from the cycle of life and death.${prompt}
  13991: And that is how those involved eventually arrived at the idea of imbuing souls into implements of power.${prompt}
  13992: If those souls are angered or cry out for vengeance, well...I'm sure that manifests itself in the potency of the armament.${prompt}
  13993: Perhaps that is why the Prime Weapons gleam with that beautiful obsidian light.${prompt}
  13994: Why, it is positively inspiring! Surely you wish to brandish them in battle even more than before.${prompt}
  13995: Ah, but we have time for one more tale. You know of the relic weapons, correct?${prompt}
  13996: My master conceived them during Ragnarok, and they contain the souls of the enlightened races.${prompt}
  13997: My master chose only the strongest from among those who proffered themselves up in his service.${prompt}
  13998: They cried out for succor. Who were we to deny them?${prompt}
  13999: Why, we were even able to help them defend their kingdoms, although perhaps in a different way than they had envisioned.${prompt}
  14000: Not that those nations exist anymore, mind you.${prompt}
  14001: That is enough stories for one day.${prompt}
  14002: I trust you found it a pleasant enough diversion, but now I bid you return to the task at hand.${prompt}
  14003: My success is linked to your success, after all. And I have new targets for you to hunt.${prompt}
  14004: Yes...I can feel it. The Prime Weapons will soon be mine to wield...${prompt}
  14005: '${color-alt: 15}Elijah smiles at you.'
  14006: '${color-alt: 15}Elijah begins laughing boisterously!'
  14007: ${name-player}. I must confess, I thought you had forgotten about me.${prompt}
  14008: We are at our watershed moment. I promise to be brief.${prompt}
  14009: As you are eminently aware, Garazu-Horeizu is on the move.${prompt}
  14010: Of course, we have no choice but to answer in kind.${prompt}
  14011: Yet moving too hastily has caused the downfall of many, so I would ask for your aid once more.${prompt}
  14012: The first issue is dealing with the defectors amongst the beastmen who have joined forces with Chaos.${prompt}
  14013: Unfortunately, their contingent is present not only in the Middle Lands, but Aht Urhgan and the Far East as well.${prompt}
  14014: With the enemy spread out across the world, I have had to dispatch some of my most loyal retainers to the far reaches of the globe.${prompt}
  14015: While they are dealing with the threat above, you will deal with Garazu-Horeizu at the gate between this world and the next.${prompt}
  14016: Of course, this will allow the gate to be opened.${prompt}
  14017: I will take up the rear guard, so you have not to fear.${prompt}
  14018: Ah, but perhaps you are concerned that my protection alone may prove insufficient.${prompt}
  14019: |-
    Are you concerned?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course!
    Of course not!${prompt}
  14020: Then we shall continue along the same path we have traveled to date.${prompt}
  14021: Oho. I may not have a Prime Weapon, but I promise that my skills are more than sufficient.${prompt}
  14022: Then we have our tasks. Let us see them through.${prompt}
  14023: This is our watershed moment. We must defeat Garazu-Horeizu and his minions.${prompt}
  14024: Best of luck to us all.${prompt}
  14025: ${name-player}. It has been a spell, hasn't it?${prompt}
  14026: You did well in ridding us of Garazu-Horeizu and Chaos.${prompt}
  14027: I would venture to say that your performance exceeded my wildest expectations.${prompt}
  14028: So much so, in fact, that I find myself at a bit of a loss.${prompt}
  14029: The original plan involved my master having a bit more of a...pivotal role in the aftermath, so to speak.${prompt}
  14030: But you kept all the best parts for yourself.${prompt}
  14031: Still, he was quite pleased with how you presented yourself during the entire ordeal.${prompt}
  14032: And my efforts were rewarded in turn, as I have been permitted to remain in this world for a spell.${prompt}
  14033: A curse in disguise, if you will, for I had hoped to return to his side.${prompt}
  14034: Yet you deserve to know a little bit more...perhaps my true name. Consider it a gift.${prompt}
  14035: I am Markgraf Eligos, and I serve as one of Odin's elite.${prompt}
  14036: May our relationship remain as fruitful going forward as it has been to date.${prompt}
  14037: Yes, “going forward,” as I still have the usual tasks for you to fulfill.${prompt}
  14038: Though Garazu-Horeizu no longer poses a threat, his hypnosis magic has still not completely dissipated from the land.${prompt}
  14039: And given the details of our pact, that means you still have your end to hold up.${prompt}
  14040: The pact cannot be broken, but rest assured that you will continue to be rewarded.${prompt}
  14041: The terms should be familiar to you by now. Continue to serve.${prompt}
  14042: And just to reiterate--there is no way to escape your obligation.${prompt}
  14043: I wish you the best of luck...${prompt}
  14044: '...and trust you will continue to meet the terms of our deal.${prompt}'
  14045: Keep at it.${prompt}
  14046: Good day, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  14047: It seems you have been quite busy cleaning up the riff-raff.${prompt}
  14048: The A.M.A.N. has reported to me that your data has come in quite handy--and that you have filled all the tasks I have required of you.${prompt}
  14049: What's this? You wish to discuss it further?${prompt}
  14050: Ah, you wish to receive additional rewards for vanquishing what threats remain. I see, I see.${prompt}
  14051: And you have been unsuccessful in your efforts to procure such rewards, no?${prompt}
  14052: For when you defeat them, they keep coming back?${prompt}
  14053: Forgive me for laughing, but you are aware that you are asking for rewards for killing that which is already dead.${prompt}
  14054: They are of a different world than ours, after all, and trapping them in this one is a fool's errand.${prompt}
  14055: But I do admire your gumption.${prompt}
  14056: I am not an unreasonable man. If you are able to best them again if and when they should appear in our plane, then who am I to deny you an extra prize?${prompt}
  14057: Then I shall prepare some more objectives for you to sink your teeth into. That strikes me as fair, wouldn't you agree?${prompt}
  14058: 'Let us set the rate: one additional reward for every three objectives completed.${prompt}'
  14059: After all, what adventurer does not love rewards, hmm? Just don't get yourself offed in the process.${prompt}
  14060: Oh, yes, and be aware that the additional reward can only be earned monthly (Earth time).${prompt}
  14061: Just keep doing what you're doing.${prompt}
  14062: Good day, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  14063: Oh, worry not. Your achievements have not gone without notice.${prompt}
  14064: Here are your additional rewards.${prompt}
  14065: May our paths cross again soon.${prompt}
  14066: Good day, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  14067: “Additional rewards?” Surely you do not think you have earned any.${prompt}
  14068: Remember that your contract with me must be carried out in full.${prompt}
  14069: Good day, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  14070: You may consider your monthly duties filled. As always, your support is greatly appreciated.${prompt}
  14071: Hopefully our paths will cross again next month.${prompt}
  14072: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Rolandienne in Southern San d'Oria (G-10).
  14073: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Isakoth in Bastok Markets (E-11).
  14074: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Fhelm Jobeizat in Windurst Woods (J-10).
