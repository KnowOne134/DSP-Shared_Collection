    Hello, therrre.

    Tell me about Mhaura.
    Any shops or guilds in town?

    Nothing for now.${prompt}
  6859: |-
    As you wish.
    Mhaura is a port town situated within the boundaries of the Windurstian Federation.${prompt}
  6860: The natural basin here was ideal for building a port. In time, people started building their homes in the surrounding cliffs. Thus Mhaura came to be.${prompt}
  6861: Geographically, Mhaura is situated in the southern half of the Buburimu Peninsula in Southeastern Mindartia. Windurst City is southwest of here.${prompt}
  6862: From the port, you can board one of the transit ships to Selbina, a town in Central Quon.${prompt}
  6863: Lately, there are even ships traveling to a city called Al Zahbi in the Near Eastern Empire of Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  6864: |-
    As you wish.
    The Blacksmiths' Guild and Goldsmiths' Guild have their salesrooms on the level below us.${prompt}
  6865: Across from them spans a bridge leading to a two-story inn called the Sailors' Stay. The reception desk is on the first floor. The armorer, Graine, is also there.${prompt}
  6866: Across the Sailors' Stay, on ground level, is the sea travel agency. Ships bound for Selbina and Al Zahbi dock there.${prompt}
  6867: To the west of the agency you'll find an antique shop. I should tell you that the owner, Orlando, has some very peculiar tastes...${prompt}
  6868: Further west, down a flight of stairs, is the warehouse.${prompt}
  6869: Pikini-Mikini, a dealer in goods, and Tya Padolih, a seller of arcane scrolls, have set up shop there.${prompt}
  6870: Jobs in Mhaura? Hmm... I believe Lady Take at the Sailors' Stay is the person to talk to about such matters.${prompt}

    You got them! They're still fresh, too!
    Thanks so much! Now I know who to ask when I need something!${prompt}
  6894: Ah...thanks, but when I saw you wouldn't make it, I asked someone else. Well, since you did bring them, though, I'll give you some gil for your efforts.${prompt}
  6895: 'Let me tell you something about cooking: a dish is only as good as its ingredients. The fresher they are, the better the food.${prompt}'
  6896: Just remember that next time, okay?${prompt}
  6897: |-
    Hey, long time no see.
    Remember the last order I got? That was from the governor herself, and she really liked the dish I made for her!${prompt}
  6898: She liked it so much, she said she wants me to prepare all her meals from now on!${prompt}
  6899: I don't want to disappoint her, so I need you to bring me exotic ingredients to practice my cooking skills!${prompt}
  6900: 'I heard they''re pretty hard to get, but I''d like to start with ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Whaddaya say?${prompt}'
  6901: |-
    Really? That's great!
    You can take your time with it, just as long as you bring me one. Good luck!${prompt}
  6902: Yeah, well, I don't blame you. They're not easy to get. Come back, though, if you change your mind.${prompt}
  6903: 'Back so soon, eh? So, do you think you can find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} for me?${prompt}'
  6904: |-
    Wow! You got it!
    I have to say, I'm really impressed!${prompt}
  6905: Here's your well-deserved reward. Come back in two or three days if you can. I still have some work for you. ${prompt}
  6906: So, how's it going? Working hard or hardly working? Take it slow, though. There's no hurry.${prompt}
  6907: Rycharde is a good cook. I'm glad to hear you've been working hard to help him. Good luck to you both!${prompt}
  6908: |-
    There you are!
    I've managed to make a pretty good dish--if I may say so myself--with the ingredient you brought me last time.${prompt}
  6909: I know I've been giving you tough jobs so far, so this time I'm going to give you an easy one.${prompt}
  6910: All you have to do is take this dish to a man named Valgeir in Selbina. Whaddaya say?${prompt}
  6911: |-
    All right!
    Go to the port and board the transit ship to Selbina. Here, I'll pay for your travel fare in advance.${prompt}
  6912: Oh, when you get back, tell me what Valgeir's reaction was, okay?${prompt}
  6913: What? C'mon, it's just a delivery job! I'll even pay your travel fare! Whaddaya say?${prompt}
  6914: |-
    So, how was it? Did he say anything?
    Oh...you haven't gone yet. Remember, the man's name is Valgeir. Now hurry to Selbina!${prompt}
  6915: |-
    So, how was it?
    Did he say anything?${prompt}

    Exactly what Valgeir said.
    That Valgeir didn't say anything.${prompt}

    He said that!? Damn that old man!
    Will he never admit that I've become as good as him?${prompt}
  6918: Really? No, I can tell from your face he did say something, and it wasn't anything good. Thanks for being considerate, but I'm okay with it.${prompt}
  6919: |-
    Oh...your reward, right. Here.
    I don't think I'll have any work for you for a while... Thanks for your help, though.${prompt}
  6920: |-
    Oh...it's you.
    Sorry, I don't have any work for you. Give me some time to...recover.${prompt}
  6921: Hi, there. You've been working for Rycharde for a while now...do you know what's wrong with him lately? He looks down.${prompt}
  6922: |-
    What? He sent you to Valgeir?
    Let me guess: he refused to recognize Rycharde's talents again, right?${prompt}
  6923: Valgeir is Rycharde's father, and one of the best cooks in Vana'diel. He's also a very strict man, especially to his son.${prompt}
  6924: He raised Rycharde to be a great cook like him, but there were some things they could never agree on. In the end, Rycharde ended up leaving home.${prompt}
  6925: Rycharde has worked hard and become a very good cook. Valgeir really should give him some credit. Don't you agree?${prompt}
  6926: But you know what? I wouldn't mind tasting some of Valgeir's cooking someday. I wonder what it's like?${prompt}
  6927: You went and brought me some of Valgeir's cooking? Thank you! I'll have Rycharde taste some of it, too.${prompt}
  6928: And here, take these. It's the least I can do.${prompt}
  6929: Thank you for working so hard to help Rycharde. I promise I'll have him taste some of his father's cooking.${prompt}
  6930: |-
    Ah, you're back.
    Ms. Take told me. I want to thank you.${prompt}
  6931: As for the old man's cooking...it was incredible. I don't think I would ever be able to make anything like that.${prompt}
  6932: But I'm not trying to emulate him. I just want to make him acknowledge my way of cooking, you know? And I need your help to accomplish that.${prompt}
  6933: 'I''d like you to bring me four ${item-plural: 0[2]}. These, again, are hard to find.${prompt}'
  6934: |-
    No deadline. I'll wait until you bring back four of them.
    So, whaddaya say?${prompt}
  6935: |-
    Great! I knew I could count on you!
    Good luck!${prompt}
  6936: |-
    That's all right, I understand. It is pretty hard work.

    Wow! Thank you!
    I knew you wouldn't let me down!${prompt}
  6939: |-
    Here, take this, you earned it!
    All right! Now I'll show that old man!${prompt}
  6940: Thanks, but...this isn't enough. Could you come back when you find four of them? Good luck!${prompt}
  6941: Thanks for bringing some of Valgeir's cooking. It was delicious! I think tasting it really helped Rycharde.${prompt}
  6942: |-
    Hi! I was waiting for you to come.
    Rejoice! My new dish is done, and I have a job for you!${prompt}
  6943: |-
    I need you to take it to Valgeir again.
    Whaddaya say, will you do it?${prompt}
  6944: So, how was it? Did he say anything? Oh...you haven't gone yet. I'm sure this time he'll be surprised, so go quick!${prompt}
  6945: 'Hmm? He sent you back to give this to me? But it''s just ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}... What does it mean?${prompt}'
  6946: |-
    Anyway, here, this is your reward.
    Thanks again.${prompt}
  6947: |-
    Hi again. Thanks for last time!
    I finally got what that ${item-singular: 0[2]} meant!${prompt}
  6948: 'My old man used to make me practice on them when he was teaching me to cook. I would usually mess it up, and he would yell at me for wasting perfectly good ${item-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  6949: For years, he kept yelling at me for every little mistake I made... So one day I left, promising myself I'd show him I could become a good cook without his help!${prompt}
  6950: 'But you know, when I was a kid, my mom used to make the best ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  6951: She wasn't trained like my old man, and she wasn't even using the best utensils...${prompt}
  6952: |-
    But Mom's ${item-plural: 1[2]} were the best!
    I loved them!${prompt}
  6953: That's what this reminded me of, and I realized I had forgotten the most important thing about cooking.${prompt}
  6954: I have to get back to the basics. But I'm glad you came along and helped me see my mistake. Thank you!${prompt}
  6955: Have you seen Rycharde lately? He seems changed. He has this look of determination I've never seen before.${prompt}
  6956: He must've rediscovered something deep inside...something he had long forgotten. I'm glad for him, and it's all thanks to you.${prompt}
  6957: What do you want? Yes, I'm Orlando the antiquary, but I don't deal with people who can't ride chocobos. That means you. Go away.${prompt}
  6958: |-
    Ah! You can ride chocobos, I see.
    I'm Orlando the antiquary. I have a proposal for you, if you're interested.${prompt}
  6959: Did you know that some of the Goblins around here hide items in the ground?${prompt}
  6960: Find those hiding spots and dig them up with a chocobo. If you're lucky, you might even find something valuable.${prompt}
  6961: But most of it will be junk. That's where I come in. Bring the junk to me and I'll buy them off you.${prompt}
  6962: I only buy items in bunches of eight, though, so only come if you have enough. Of course, the amount I'll pay depends on what you bring.${prompt}
  6963: |-
    Good hunting, then!
    But be careful. There are things worse than Goblins out there!${prompt}
  6964: 'Let''s see what you''ve brought... ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 1[2]}, eh? I''ll give you ${number: 0} gil for them. Come back when you''ve dug up some more!${prompt}'
  6965: Hmm? It seems like you can't carry anything else. Come back when you've lightened your load.${prompt}
  6966: This isn't enough. I told you, I only buy items in bunches of eight. Come back when you have enough, all right?${prompt}
  6967: |-
    So, how goes the hunt?
    Bring me eight of the same items and I'll buy them off you. I'll pay more if their quality is good. Good luck!${prompt}
  6968: People call me a “junk collector,” but they're just a bunch of ignoramuses. Only connoisseurs like me can appreciate the true value of what I have.${prompt}
  6969: |-
    Oh... Hello.
    I'm waiting for my husband. He's a sailor. I'll be fine. I'm used to waiting.${prompt}

    Hello again.
    Thank you for helping us. Hm? What am I still doing here?${prompt}

  7016: So I've decided to stand here and pray for the safety of all who make their living out on the sea.${prompt}
  7017: May the sea be kind to those who venture out in her realm...${prompt}
  7018: Eh? What have we got here? A fledgling adventurer! I have no business with the likes of you!${prompt}

  7020: |-
    Well, uh...
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I am!
    No, not really.${prompt}
  7021: Heh-heh-heh. A confident one! Good, good! You remind me of me when I was young!${prompt}
  7022: Heh-heh-heh. Modest, are we? You don't have to be. I may be old, but I'm not blind.${prompt}

    Interested?
    ${selection-lines}
    What is it?
    I'm too busy.${prompt}
  7025: |-
    I'm glad you asked.
    You see, I've been making pottery in this town for as long as I can remember... I'm what they'd call an artisan.${prompt}
  7026: I've used clay from nearby areas in my work for many years, but I've been favoring clay from the Gusgen Mines lately.${prompt}
  7027: 'The thing is, though, a bunch of fiends seem to have made those mines their home, and traders haven''t been able to get any ${item-plural: 0[2]} out of there.${prompt}'
  7028: It wasn't so hard to get some a few years back... You have to understand, to an artisan like myself, getting that clay is a matter of life and death.${prompt}
  7029: 'So...I need a stalwart adventurer like you to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. I''ve heard you can find it deep within the mines.${prompt}'
  7030: Just make sure to get a map so you don't get lost in there. Good luck!${prompt}
  7031: You're too busy, eh? Well, then...come back when you have time.${prompt}
  7032: 'Yes? Did you forget something? Please get me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} as soon as you can. Those mines are dangerous, though, so you take care, eh?${prompt}'

    Ah, you've come back!
    I need another ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Can you go get some for me?${prompt}
  7035: |-
    Very good!
    Remember, it's in those mines I told you about before. Be careful, eh?${prompt}
  7036: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    Thanks, but I have enough for now.
    Come back later. I may need some more then.${prompt}
  7037: Eh? What does an adventurer like you want with me? Shouldn't you be out fighting beastmen, bringing peace to the world and all that?${prompt}
  7038: Eh? Another fledgling adventurer? There seem to be more and more of you people these days.${prompt}
  7039: I may be able to teach you a thing or two... Interested?${prompt}
  7040: 'I''m glad you are. But I won''t talk for free. Why don''t you bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} for starters, eh?${prompt}'

  7047: |-
    Hoh-hoh.
    Yes, this is what I asked for. I'm ready to talk now.${prompt}
  7048: So, you see... Oh, dear. What was I going to say? I forget so many things these days.${prompt}
  7049: 'Hmm...you know, I heard ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is good for your memory.${prompt}'
  7050: If you bring me some, I might remember what I was trying to tell you. Would you go look for some?${prompt}
  7051: |-
    Thank you.
    I'll try to remember on my own in the meantime.${prompt}
  7052: |-
    That's too bad for you.
    I'm sure whatever I was going to tell you would've helped you a lot. Are you sure you won't go?${prompt}
  7053: Ah! Yes, this is it. But I managed to remember without it. Hoh-hoh. Now, listen close...${prompt}
  7054: Have you ever seen people use abilities from jobs other than their main one? Those people are using something called “support jobs.”${prompt}
  7055: And if you can't use support jobs, you don't deserve to be called an adventurer! But I can help you with that. Hoh-hoh.${prompt}
  7056: 'It''s all up to you, but if you do want me to teach you...you''ll have to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} first.${prompt}'
  7057: Hmm... I see you've got some vim after all. You may become a real adventurer yet. Hoh-hoh. All right, I'll teach you about support jobs as I promised.${prompt}
  7058: You can add a support job to your main one wherever you can change jobs. Of course, it has to be a job you've already acquired.${prompt}
  7059: But whatever you choose as your support job, its effective level will never exceed half that of your main one. Your support job won't benefit from any experience points you gain, either. It is, after all, only meant to be supplemental.${prompt}
  7060: 'Let me give you an example: Let''s say you''ve achieved level 20 as a warrior and level 10 as a white mage. If you choose warrior as your main job and white mage as your support job, the following will occur...${prompt}'
  7061: Your warrior level stays the same at 20, and your effective level in white mage also stays at 10--half the level of your main job. In this case, both jobs function to the fullest in their roles.${prompt}
  7062: Now, say you choose the same white mage job as your main one and put your warrior job as your support job...${prompt}
  7063: Your white mage level is still 10, but the effective level of your warrior job drops to 5, half the level of your main job. Now, that's a lot of wasted potential, isn't it? Hoh-hoh.${prompt}
  7064: And selecting a job with a level less than half of your main one as your support job isn't going to do you much good, either. Make sure you're using your jobs to their fullest when choosing support jobs.${prompt}
  7065: As to which job is best suited to your main job...ideally, it should be one that either covers your main job's weaknesses, or one that enhances its strengths.${prompt}
  7066: |-
    ...That's about it.
    Is everything clear?${prompt}
  7067: |-
    Do you understand how support jobs work?
    ${selection-lines}
    Got it.
    Can you run that by me again?${prompt}
  7068: Good. Then why are you still here? Go try it out, already! And don't forget to thank me when it saves your skin. Hoh-hoh.${prompt}
  7069: |-
    Oh, you again.
    You must've thought I was asking you to bring me those things out of greed. Hoh-hoh.${prompt}
  7070: But you realize I was only testing you to see if you could actually get them. I used to be in the Market...Mooseket...Muskewhatchamacallits before, you know?${prompt}
  7071: You look dubious. I did teach you how to use support jobs, didn't I? Well, you're free to believe whatever you want, but what you have now is real power. Use it wisely. Hoh-hoh.${prompt}
  7072: You can now use support jobs!${prompt}
  7073: I heard once that old Vera was a warrior of some renown when she was young. It's before my time, of course, so I don't know if it is true.${prompt}
  7074: And by her age, I'd say anyone who could testify to the veracity of that rumor would be long gone.${prompt}

    Fishing is an art...
    I have nothing to say to one who has never held a fishing rod in his life.${prompt}

  7173: I've always wondered...where do pirates live? I mean, they can't always be living on their ship. They must have a base somewhere...${prompt}
  7174: The old woman who's always standing in front of the warehouse gives me the heebie-jeebies, but for some reason a lot of people come to see her. I wonder why?${prompt}

    Hmm?

  7263: Well, you're not going to fool me. I'm done talking with you, so be on your way.${prompt}
  7264: The Tenshodo is treating this talk of the Atarefaunet treasure as just another rumor. To spread this far, though, there must be a kernel of truth to it.${prompt}

  7274: |-
    Do you know of the Fire Tribe?
    They are a Mithran tribe that lives on the southern continent.${prompt}
  7275: |-
    It was some thirty years ago now.
    The chieftainness of that tribe committed the sin of slaying a fellow tribal member.${prompt}
  7276: |-
    She spent ten years atoning for that sin in the homeland...
    When war broke out here, she escaped from prison, crossing over to this continent with her daughter in tow.${prompt}
  7277: At the time, I was performing the dangerous duty of escorting people and supplies between Jeuno and Windurst.${prompt}
  7278: One day, a Mithran woman and her child slipped into our company.${prompt}
  7279: We set out for Jeuno, not realizing it was the chieftainness and her daughter who had joined us.${prompt}
  7280: |-
    However, things didn't go as planned.
    We were discovered by a party of Yagudo in the Meriphataud Mountains.${prompt}
  7281: The Yagudo quickly overwhelmed us, and we were taken to Castle Oztroja and held as prisoners.${prompt}
  7282: The prison of Oztroja was a terrible place. All we could do was shiver in the biting cold.${prompt}
  7283: At regular intervals, the Yagudo would come to drag one of us from the prison.${prompt}
  7284: |-
    Finally, the Chieftainness of the Fire Tribe was taken away, leaving her daughter behind.
    Only the two of us were left...${prompt}
  7285: '......${prompt}'
  7286: Not long after that, we were saved by the elite warriors stationed in the Meriphataud Mountains, led by Perih Vashai herself.${prompt}
  7287: I took the child back to Jeuno, but she grew thinner by the day from misery and exhaustion.${prompt}
  7288: '...Her body was interred in the Eldieme Necropolis, along with the remains of the other races who had died in the war.${prompt}'
  7289: The daughter of the sinner could not be buried in the lands of the Mithra...${prompt}
  7290: I go now to check the verrracity of that story, to see for my own eyes the body of Syu Befrathi, daughter of Chieftainness Nhev Befrathi.${prompt}
  7291: I have heard from the townspeople that dangerous creatures rrroam the dark hallways of the Eldieme Necropolis.${prompt}
  7292: It is a place that cannot be entered alone. But of course, I have no intention of giving up on my quarrry.${prompt}
  7293: |-
    You are one of the brrreed they call adventurers, right?
    Adventurers are said to take on almost any kind of work as long as the pay is good.${prompt}
  7294: I will follow after you, keeping out of sight. Clear the path ahead, making for the cemetery in the center of the necropolis.${prompt}
  7295: Meet me at the necropolis, and don't be late.${prompt}
  7296: Most of the old Mithra living near Windurst are of the southern Fire Tribe.${prompt}
  7297: However, they would not harborrr the sinner out of pity. A sin must be atoned for, and this cannot be avoided.${prompt}
  7298: It would seem the Mithran Tracker was not satisfied with the way things turned out.${prompt}
  7299: I don't believe she can return home without first discovering the whereabouts of the Bow of Light.${prompt}
  7300: |-
    You must be...
    You are the one who is in the employ of Chieftainness Perih Vashai?${prompt}

  7309: |-
    ...!
    So, it was switched...${prompt}
  7310: |-
    Yes, by your mother's request...
    To help the sinner's daughter escape, your mother gave her earring to the sinner.${prompt}
  7311: And, just to be safe, your earring was also switched.${prompt}
  7312: |-
    ...!!
    Why would my mother do such a thing...?${prompt}
  7313: You know the story of the company that was held captive in Castle Oztroja twenty years ago, and how the sinner and her child were with them?${prompt}
  7314: Perih Vashai was deeply troubled over whether or not to send the child back to the homeland.${prompt}
  7315: One night, the chieftainness came to me. We would report to the homeland that the sinner and her daughter had both perished in Castle Oztroja at the hands of the Yagudo.${prompt}
  7316: 'And for prrroof of her identity...it was necessary to swap the ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  7317: Yes. At the time, we were unaware of the scent that lingers on the sinner. We believed that everything would be solved.${prompt}
  7318: Using my mother's earring to help the sinner...how can I forgive something like that?${prompt}
  7319: All of this was done for the Bow of Light carried by the sinner, rrright?${prompt}
  7320: At this point, you wouldn't believe anything I had to say. What I can tell you is...${prompt}

    The ${item-singular: 1[2]} that you hold, the one that really belongs to you...

    I have no rrreal desire to see a mother who would leave me to travel to the Northlands, but since I have come this far, I will go.

  7331: |-
    Now...
    Let me tell you what really happened those twenty years ago.${prompt}
  7332: When we were imprisoned by the Yagudo in the Meriphataud Mountains, only the Fire Tribe chieftainness, Nhev Befrathi, managed to escape.${prompt}
  7333: However, this left her daughter, Syu Befrathi, in the clutches of the Yagudo...${prompt}
  7334: To save her daughter, Chieftainness Nhev Befrathi ran into the nearby camp of Perih Vashai and her elite warriors.${prompt}
  7335: For the chieftainness, this act was akin to jumping right back into prison, but it was the only option she had left for her daughter's rescue.${prompt}
  7336: After hearing the words of Nhev Befrathi, Perih Vashai immediately led her warriors on a raid of Castle Oztroja, not waiting for the dawn.${prompt}
  7337: The power of the Bow of Light was incredible to behold. Even so, many warriors lost their lives that day.${prompt}
  7338: When we finally escaped from the castle, only a handful of warriors remained.${prompt}
  7339: In that battle, Chieftainness Perih Vashai lost the light, and Nhev Befrathi, her life.${prompt}
  7340: |-
    Left behind were the sinner's daughter, Syu Befrathi, and the Bow of Light...
    We did our utmost to deceive everyone.${prompt}
  7341: |-
    ......
    Semih Lafihna must have learned something in the Northlands by now.${prompt}
  7342: Please travel to the Northlands and look for a cave near Castle Zvahl.${prompt}
  7343: And if you happen to meet someone there, please give her my letter.${prompt}
  7344: Please travel to the Northlands and look for a cave near Castle Zvahl.${prompt}
  7345: And if you happen to meet someone there, please give her my letter.${prompt}
  7346: Has Semih Lafihna discovered who her mother is?${prompt}
  7347: This is not a matter that can be resolved with a few simple words from me. The long years have shackled her heart in chains.${prompt}
  7348: It will take both time and a strong will for her to free herself from them.${prompt}
  7349: Owzie-wowzie! Don't make me talk. I hurt all over!${prompt}
  7350: Try though you may, there will come a time when failure is inevitable.${prompt}
  7351: Channel that agony and bitterness into creating a new plan.${prompt}
  7352: Owzie-wowzie! Don't make me talk. I hurt all over!${prompt}
  7353: Hey! You're that famous adventurer, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7354: Yippee! It must be destiny that brought us together!${prompt}
  7355: Let me introduce myself. I am from the Rhinostery in Windurst. I do research on various living things.${prompt}
  7356: And I'm the besty-westy they've got! I've been looking into phenomena at a certain place.${prompt}
  7357: |-
    I can't talk about it too loudly, but have you ever seen one of those huge crystals?
    They're found all over the world, far into the wilderness, and deep down in dungeons...${prompt}
  7358: |-
    From those crystals, a strangey-wangey power is constantly pouring forth.
    Our research team had been investigating the unusual emanations when...${prompt}
  7359: Well, take a look at this!${prompt}
  7360: As a result of our research, we finally succeeded in awakening the crystals!${prompt}
  7361: |-
    Our theory on what lay dormant inside the crystals was proven to be rightaru on the money!
    However, they didn't appreciate being woken up, and attacked us.${prompt}
  7362: |-
    Why do they so despise talking with us that they would rather fight?
    And what on Vana'diel would happen if someone were to defeat them?${prompt}
  7363: |-
    I'm sure that you could do it!
    Will you help us out with our research? ${prompt}
  7364: |-
    Take up the challenge?
    ${selection-lines}
    Bring it on!
    Ah, no, thanks...${prompt}
  7365: |-
    Wonderful!
    Here, take this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}. But be warned--only a person who carries one can enter the crystal.${prompt}
  7366: 'This ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} will awaken the giant crystal that is found ${choice: 2}[in Ifrit''s Cauldron/in the Quicksand Caves/in the Den of Rancor/in Cape Teriggan/in Fei''Yin/in The Boyahda Tree].${prompt}'
  7367: |-
    Without it, you won't be getting inside no matter how sneaky-weaky you are!
    Oh, and if you want to take some friends with you, they also have to get ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} from me. Okey-dokey?${prompt}
  7368: If you don't prepare yourself for battle, you'll get beaten to a pulp, like we did! ${prompt}
  7369: "As soon as we gather our companions, we'll be jumping into the fray again. \nI just hope this little researcher doesn't get in our way...${prompt}"
  7370: |-
    Excuse me!
    If I don't go with you, there's no pointaru to the research now is there?${prompt}
  7371: |-
    Is it true?${wait-36: 1}
    You really defeated a prime avatar!?${prompt}
  7372: |-
    ...I see.
    The prime avatar said that to you?
    I wonder what it could mean.${prompt}

  7402: Oh, it's Ildy-Goldy!${prompt}
  7403: It's been some time since you made that tuning fork. Are you still researching those giant-viant crystals?${prompt}
  7404: Ah, yes, I've asked a veteran adventurer to look into that for me, but ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] hasn't come back yet.${prompt}
  7405: |-
    ...Wait.
    Did ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] come back already?

    Vhat's wrong vith you? Pull yourself together, man.
    I don't think the food in this country agrees with you. Or maybe you haven't been getting enough snoozy-vooze time lately?${prompt}

    No, it's nothing like that...
    I guess I have been kinda tired lately, though...${prompt}
  7408: |-
    Vell, no mattaru.
    I'll go take a look. I've been asked to carry out an experiment with the new version of the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, the ${color: 5}improved tuning fork of earth${color: 1}.${prompt}
  7409: 'Hey ${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Miss] Adventurer, you look like the reliable-viable type. Maybe you can help me out here. Take this ${item-singular: 3[2]} to the Quicksand Caves in the Eastern Altepa Desert.${prompt}'
  7410: 'Using my improved tuning fork of earth along with the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, should allow more people to be drawn into the crystal than using the regular ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  7411: Ildy-Goldy is extremely-wemely proficient in hand-to-hand combat, something very unusual among we Tarutaru. He's always high on the list when researchers are looking for a Rhinostery adventurer to accompany them to the wild lands.${prompt}
  7412: With his skill, he's likely to defeat the avatar that slumbers within the protocrystal.${prompt}
  7413: 'Please make your way to the Quicksand Caves of the Eastern Altepa Desert and bring the ${item-singular: 5[2]} into contact with the crystal.${prompt}'
  7414: |-
    ...By the way...
    You probably want to assist Ildy-Goldy with his experiment, but have you ever thought of doing your own investigation into the protocrystals?${prompt}
  7415: |-
    Do you want to do your own investigation?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I thirst for knowledge!
    Um, not really...${prompt}
  7416: |-
    Well, then.
    First, let me introduce myself.${prompt}
  7417: I am a researcher from the Rhinostery in Windurst. Rhinostery researchers study all kinds of plants and animals in every corner of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7418: 'You lost the ${item-singular: 1[2]}!?${prompt}'
  7419: |-
    What a spacey-wacey individual...
    Well, I guess I'll give you a new one.${prompt}
  7420: |-
    Welcome back.
    Ildy-Goldy returned a little while before. He's been waiting for you.${prompt}
  7421: |-
    Oh good, you made it back in one piece.
    I'm sorry about before, I was completely-vetely caught up with chasing down Uran-Mafran.${prompt}
  7422: I didn't end up collaring him, though. Those mages can be a slippery-vippery bunch...${prompt}
  7423: '...But at least ve know the reason vhy the researchers have been acting so odd-voddly lately.${prompt}'
  7424: |-
    It vas all his doing.
    Uran-Mafran... He's been erasing everybody's memories.${prompt}
  7425: Vhen you get back to Vindurst, could you report this to the principal?${prompt}
  7426: I don't know if Principal Koru-Moru vill remember Uran-Mafran, but it's vorth a shot.${prompt}
  7427: Urrrrgh...${prompt}
  7428: |-
    Ah, excuse me!
    I need your help!${prompt}
  7429: 'I just had a run-in with the beastmaster regarded as Professor Shantotto''s prize student. That rogue wrested the ${color: 5}improved tuning fork of ice${color: 1} from me and took off!${prompt}'
  7430: I have absolutaruly no obligation to hand over that incredibly difficult-to-make tuning fork to someone so uncooperative towards the Rhinostery's experiment!${prompt}
  7431: |-
    I beg of you!
    Please go to Fei'Yin and get back the ${color: 5}improved tuning fork of ice${color: 1}! Take this ${item-singular: 1[2]} for your troubles.${prompt}

    Investigate the crystal in Fei'Yin?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  7436: '...Well then, allow me to introduce myself...${prompt}'
  7437: I am a researcher from the Rhinostery in Windurst. Rhinostery researchers study all kinds of plants and animals in every corner of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7438: The improved tuning fork was used by that rougue...?${prompt}
  7439: |-
    But it didn't work properly?
    Ahahaha, that's justice for you!${prompt}
  7440: |-
    ...Oh dear Goddess...
    Something terrible has happened. An adventurer just collapsed in front of me and hasn't regained consciousness.${prompt}
  7441: When he collapsed a cutesy-wutesy creature glowing with blue energy leaped out towards the north.${prompt}
  7442: Would the adventurer's condition be the fault of that blue-glowing pixie? It must be that creature called “Carbuncle” I've been hearing rumors about.${prompt}
  7443: |-
    Please take this.
    North of here...there is a protocrystal hidden within the Boyahda Tree. Maybe the source of this malady lies there...?${prompt}
  7444: '...Well, I must regain my focus and continue with my work...${prompt}'
  7445: Um, I'm looking for an adventurer to investigate a protocrystal in this area.${prompt}
  7446: |-
    Investigate?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure.
    Not right now...${prompt}
  7447: |-
    Well, then.
    I should start by introducing myself...${prompt}
  7448: I am a researcher from the Rhinostery in Windurst. Rhinostery researchers study all kinds of plants and animals in every corner of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7449: |-
    ...We m-m-meet again...
    ...There is no need for violence, adventurer...${prompt}
  7450: |-
    ...I just wish to ask you som-m-me questions.
    ...Why do you think the avatars...give power to people...without a reason...?${prompt}
  7451: ..And...have you...felt the power...of the avatars...?${prompt}
  7452: "Hahaha...\n...Rather than strength without purpose... \n...you should be seeking...true power...${prompt}"
  7453: |-
    ...We m-m-meet...again...
    I shall...fulfill...my charge.${prompt}
  7454: The beast...shall claim...its due...${prompt}
  7455: I shall...see it...carried out...${prompt}
  7456: 'What? You want another ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}?${prompt}'
  7457: Oh, all right... But be careful-wareful with this one! These things don't grow on star trees, you know.${prompt}
  7458: |-
    Hmmm...
    Hrmmm...
    So it's time to use...no...${prompt}
  7459: |-
    Hello?
    You're an adventurer, right?
    Maybe you can help us out.${prompt}
  7460: Let me introduce myself and my companion. We're from the Rhinostery in Windurst.${prompt}
  7461: 'I was hired by the ministry to accompany this researcher to ${choice: 2}[Ifrit''s Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei''Yin/the Boyahda Tree] and assist her in her study of a series of giant crystals.${prompt}'
  7462: But what was waiting for us inside those crystals was more than I could deal with...${prompt}
  7463: |-
    We tried countless times, but I could not defeat that beast.
    Another researcher at the Rhinostery sympathized with our plight and developed an improved tuning fork.${prompt}
  7464: |-
    No no no no no!
    That crazy-wazy contraption won't provide us with any useful data!${prompt}
  7465: |-
    Listen, muscle-hussle brain.
    Science is not about winning or spinning, life or strife, even or Steven! It's a more delicate subjectaru!${prompt}
  7466: Do you see what I have to deal with? I don't know how much longer I can work with such a pessimist.${prompt}
  7467: |-
    That's where you come in.
    I was thinking of letting one of you adventurers test out the new fork and prove to my colleague that it is able to return data valuable to her research.${prompt}
  7468: |-
    No no no no no!
    Even if they use that half-rate spork, it'll take a tip-top summoner to defeat the prime avatar!${prompt}
  7469: |-
    Listen up.
    The fandangled ${item-singular: 1[2]} won't make it any easier for you to downright defeat the monster inside the crystal. Sure, it'll lower the power of the prime avatar to around ${number: 3}, but it will do the same to you! And on top of that, you'll only be able to summon that itty-bitty blue bugger, Carbuncle!${prompt}
  7470: And to make things worse, nobody-buddy else can enter the crystal with you! You'll be battling one-on-one, man-to-man, Taru-et-Taru!${prompt}
  7471: |-
    ...
    Yes, but ma'am... The Rhinostery has been pressing us to produce results. If we do not take some sort of action quickly...${prompt}
  7472: |-
    Hmmm...
    You do have a point there...
    I guess one round with a prime avatar wouldn't hurtaru.${prompt}
  7473: No, one round could not hurt.${prompt}
  7474: |-
    You know that you probably won't gain anything from this battle-waddle.
    Are you sure you still want the fork?${prompt}
  7475: |-
    Are you really-dilly sure?
    ${selection-lines}
    Fork me!
    On second thought...${prompt}
  7476: |-
    Well, you asked for it!
    Take this ${item-singular: 1[2]} and ring it near one of those giant crystals. The prime avatar won't be slap-happy to be woken up, and you'll have to deal with its wrath.${prompt}
  7477: 'I guess because you are helping us check out this new tuning fork, I can use my mighty-minty magic to warp you near the giant crystal in ${choice: 2}[Ifrit''s Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei''Yin/the Boyahda Tree]. When you''re ready, just show my companion the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  7478: 'The researcher who made the ${item-singular: 1[2]} warned that “the door home would only open to those who defeated the prime avatar.”${prompt}'
  7479: |-
    I'm not quite sure what that is supposed to mean, but I suggest that you prepare well before taking on this journey.
    Remember, you have to be at least a level ${number: 3} summoner.${prompt}
  7480: 'Are you and Carbuncle ready to fight the prime avatar as a level ${number: 3} summoner?${prompt}'
  7481: Also, regardless of whether you defeat the avatar or not, you will be unable to re-enter the protocrystal again for a number of days.${prompt}
  7482: |-
    Are you sure you are ready?
    ${selection-lines}
    Off to ${choice: 2}[Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree]!
    My dog ate my ${color: 5}mini tuning fork${color: 1}.
    Not just yet...${prompt}
  7483: Ma'am, our adventurer has completed ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] preparations and requests a warp.${prompt}

    ...
    Alacazimzam-scooby-dooby...
    ...
  7485: Sha-mone!
  7486: |-
    Don't use that excuse on me, ${choice-player-gender}[young man/young lady].
    If you want another ${item-singular: 1[2]}, all you have to do ask.${prompt}
  7487: 'If you do not bring the ${item-singular: 1[2]} we gave you, my companion cannot warp you to ${choice: 2}[Ifrit''s Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei''Yin/the Boyahda Tree].${prompt}'
  7488: 'Did you remember to bring the ${item-singular: 1[2]}?${prompt}'
  7489: |-
    What!?
    You defeated the prime avatar!?${prompt}
  7490: Ma'am!${prompt}
  7491: |-
    Hmmm...
    Just as I thoughtaru. The prime avatar that you fought with this spunky-junky tuning fork was nothing but a fake. Researching real avatars with real tuning forks is how real researchers do real research in the real world!${prompt}

    ...
    Ma'am...${prompt}
  7493: |-
    ...${wait-36: 1}
    (Now if I could only find me some real work so I could do some real adventuring...)${prompt}
  7494: 'I don''t think you''ll get much out of it, but if you want to go get your buttaru kicked by the prime avatar again, all you have to do is ring another ${item-singular: 1[2]} near a giant crystal.${prompt}'
  7495: 'Remember that you must fight the prime avatar as a level ${number: 3} summoner. As you already know, this will not be an easy task. Prepare well for the battle.${prompt}'
  7496: |-
    Do you want another ${color: 5}mini tuning fork${color: 1}?
    ${selection-lines}
    Fork me baby, one more time.
    Stick a fork in me, I'm done.${prompt}
  7497: Hey! You're that famous adventurer, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7498: Maybe you can help us outaru!${prompt}
  7499: Let me introduce myself. I am from the Rhinostery in Windurst. I do research on various living things.${prompt}
  7500: You already-weddy know about the super-giant crystals, rightaru?${prompt}
  7501: |-
    Why do these avatars so despise talking with us that they would rather fight?
    And what on Vana'diel would happen if someone were to defeat them?${prompt}
  7502: You were able to handle one all by yourself. You should have no problem defeating one with your buddy-wuddies. You'll help us out, right?${prompt}
  7503: Ahem, now let me introduce myself...${prompt}
  7504: Ah, you are back. How was your battle with the avatar?${prompt}
  7505: Remember, the protocrystals will only resonate with the tuning forks ever so often. Use this time to rest before taking upon another challenge.${prompt}
  7506: I got no business with a flea like you. Get outta my face before I decide to messy-wess you up.${prompt}
  7507: You're ${name-player}, right? Ha ha ha! I knew it! Just like Gilgamesh described. Lemme tell you what I gotty-wot so far.${prompt}
  7508: The creepy-weep that stole our helmet isn't from any large syndicate. He isn't even very famous among other pirates. He's just a simple thiefy-weef trying to pull off a big job for a big profit.${prompt}
  7509: According to the owner of that inn, he traveled numerous timey-wimes between here and Selbina, and would sometimes talk about his plans after a few too many drinky-winks. But then one day, he just disappeared.${prompt}
  7510: After looking at Norg's nautical loggy-wogs, I learned that the time he disappeared matches the time he must have entered our headquarters. But where he went from therey-where, I don't know.${prompt}
  7511: Wa-wa-wait! There's something else.${prompt}
  7512: One of our men in Bastok is piecing together all the information we've gathered so far. He's hiding out in a run-down old housey-wouse in the Mines District (J-6). He should be able to give you something juicy-wuicy.${prompt}
  7513: I thought that this might have been the work of some large groupy-woop, but when I heard that it was just one guy...boy, was I surprisey-wised!${prompt}
  7514: I can understand wanting to makey-wake it big overnight, but he should have thought a little bitty-wit longer before deciding to take us on!${prompt}
  7515: Would you mind leaving me alone? I have no time for small talk.${prompt}
  7516: You are ${name-player}, are you not? I have been waiting for your arrival. I do not have much time, so I will keep this quick.${prompt}
  7517: The day of the theft, there were numerous reports of a strange character wearing an even stranger helmet traveling on foot towards Zulkheim.${prompt}
  7518: I journeyed here from San d'Oria, but heard nothing of such sightings on my way. This leaves the possibility that he may have turned back to Jeuno.${prompt}
  7519: I feel that he may still be in the area. I am going to continue my search here.${prompt}
  7520: And one other thing.${prompt}
  7521: One more of us is stationed in a small, run-down building in the Bastok Mines (J-6). He may have some useful information.${prompt}
  7522: The type of helmet that was stolen is known in the Far East as a “kabuto.” Many people find its design strange, but I find it quite interesting.${prompt}
  7523: You're finally here, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7524: |-
    I've heard of you from my associates in Norg. As much as I would like to sit and chat with you about your adventures, we must work quickly to find our thief.
    I have just received a new piece of information and will be setting out shortly to investigate.${prompt}
  7525: To the northeast of here is a place called the Palborough Mines. I've received information on several adventurers sighting a young man wearing a strangely shaped helmet journeying deep into those caves.${prompt}
  7526: This is more than likely the same character that Sanosuke learned of in Jeuno. But why would he head to the Palborough Mines? I'm heading there myself to find out.${prompt}
  7527: I have heard that the Quadav made that place into one of their strongholds. I wonder if there could be some connection...${prompt}
  7528: You may journey to the mines with me if you wish. When you have made your preparations, meet me there. I will be waiting.${prompt}
  7529: I-it's you...${prompt}
  7530: We're too...late. He's already...passed through the...portal. The seal...on the helmet...won't hold much...longer.${prompt}
  7531: Unless you want to end up...like me, don't...touch the burning circle. It's protected...by a powerful curse.${prompt}
  7532: Hurry...back to Norg and tell...them what's happened. Get something to...break the curse...keep the demon...from escaping...${prompt}
  7533: '.........${prompt}'
  7534: 'He has lost consciousness.${wait-animation: 2}'
  7535: The time has come for me to rise again... I am no longer bound by the chains that annoying Hume forced upon me...${prompt}
  7536: Many a night I wasted away, rotting in the darkness of my prison...${prompt}
  7537: Gnyah-hah-hah! But Humes are a frail species. They grow old and wither away. The one who sent me to my hell is no more...${prompt}
  7538: Now there are none who can stand in my way!${prompt}
  7539: What is this? I sense someone approaching... Someone with the same power as that Hume...${prompt}
  7540: You did it!${prompt}
  7541: The seal was broken, but thanks to you, the demon has been put to rest.${prompt}
  7542: 'Our ancestors'' ${item-singular: 0[2]} has been damaged, but its tattered appearance is proof of the evil sprit''s demise. Take this back to Norg and inform them of your deeds.${prompt}'
  7543: |-
    Much of the cursed seal still remains. I will remain here and attempt to clear the rest of it away.

  7557: 'Hey! You look like a well-trrraveled ${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady]. Have you ever heard of a thing called a ${color: 5}mannequin${color: 1}?${prompt}'
  7558: You know, they're these life-sized dolls that are used to display clothes and armor. I heard that up until a few years back, you couldn't walk into a guild or tailor shop without running into one. They were all overrr the place!${prompt}
  7559: According to my mentor, it wasn't just the looks of a mannequin that set it apart from other dolls, but the crrraftsmanship of the joints that held the parts together.${prompt}
  7560: Supposedly, the joints were all crafted by a single master goldsmith whose skills were years ahead of her time. Thanks to her work, the mannequins could be posed in any way thinkable--they were more human than a Hume!${prompt}
  7561: Whether it be a stiff suit of armor or a complicated tunic, there wasn't a thing that didn't look naturrral on one of those works of art. Just the thought of making one of my own gets my goldsmithing heart racing.${prompt}
  7562: However, as you can see, there's not a mannequin to be found within five thousand malms of this place. Nobody's making 'em and nobody's using 'em. What I can't figure out is why all of 'em disappeared...${prompt}
  7563: |-
    So!
    You're gonna help me find out how I can make the display dolls.
    Don't give me that look! You'll get your reward.
    How about I make you your own mannequin? How does that sound?${prompt}
  7564: Hmm... I already checked the Weavers' Guild in Windurst and they didn't have any mannequins left...${prompt}
  7565: But maybe they still have one lying arrround the guild in Selbina!${prompt}
  7566: Ah-ha! So there must be some deep, darrrk reason why people stopped crafting mannequins...${prompt}
  7567: |-
    Good work, ${name-player}.
    But I'm still not satisfied. Hearing all this talk about curses and beastmen just gets me morrre excited! Now I just have to have one of my own!${prompt}
  7568: Looking at this catalog you brought back gives a fairrrly good idea of what a mannequin looks like, but it tells me nothing about what materials I'm gonna need.${prompt}
  7569: |-
    I think we should go on that lead the old lady at the Weavers' Guild gave us.
    Go on! Get your tail over to the Carpenters' Guild in San d'Oria!${prompt}
  7570: |-
    Diagrrrams!
    With these, I think I'll be able to reproduce the joints.${prompt}

  7572: Unbelievable! You've found all the parts!${prompt}
  7573: |-
    I'll start on the joints rrright away.
    This might take me a while, but I guarantee you won't be disappointed with the final product.${prompt}
  7574: |-
    Ta-dah!
    I've done it! I've successfully reproduced the master goldsmith's finest work...well, almost. You can't actually move the joints, but the mannequin still looks great standing strrraight. And just think how marrrvelous a suit of armor will look resting on it!${prompt}
  7575: |-
    I've learned a lot from making this, and my next work is surrre to be a masterpiece! I still have a ways to go, but soon everyone will be calling me a master goldsmith!
    Oh yeah, you can take this mannequin as your reward. Thanks for all your help!${prompt}
  7576: So, how's my mannequin holding up? ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] looks prrretty good, doesn't ${choice-player-gender}[he/she]?${prompt}
  7577: You know what I don't under-blunder-stand? You'd think a port town like this would be over-grover-flowing with fresher-fishermen (and women). I guess I'm just not trying hard enough...${prompt}

  7585: Oh, and one more thing...${prompt}
  7586: I just joined the Fussy-Fishermen's Guild and am not quite that good at repairing rods yet (my wood-waddly-working skill's only 16). I still have a lot of trouble fixing the ones with the teeny-tiny little cracks in them.${prompt}
  7587: If possible, I'd appreciate it if the poles you bring back were busted clean in two. Thanks, mate-aru!${prompt}
  7588: Recently I've been receiving a lot of crabby complaints about how my recycled rods break really easily. I wonder if I'm doing anything wrong when repairing them...${prompt}
  7589: If you have the time, do you think you could travel to Bibiki Bay and try to find one of my recycled rods? I have to get to the bare-bottom of this if I want to keep my busy-business going.${prompt}
  7590: No no no no no... This would be way too darn difficult for me to repair. I can only fix rods that have been snippity-snapped clean in two.${prompt}
  7591: Oh! What a clean break! Even I can fix this guy!${prompt}
  7592: |-
    Hm?
    Huh?
    What?${prompt}

  7597: |-
    Anyway, thanks for bringing back the rod. Here's your reward.
    I'll report the dittily-details of this matter to the guild.${prompt}
  7598: Thanks to the hard work of you adventurers, my workshop has been overrrflowing with mannequin parts. Unfortunately, as you can see, I don't have much in the way of storage space here. That's why I've decided to start putting the pieces together and sell the finished prrroducts!${prompt}

    But these crimes I hunt, against whom have they been perpetrated?

    And then I felt it.
    The sense of justice within me.${prompt}

    Words cannot explain it.
    It is something you must learn about yourself as you live and grow.${prompt}

    Do not lament the fact that you have yet to learn this truth.

    My journey with you has brought priceless experiences and valuable time to think.

    Snap out of it, fuzz-for-brains.
    It's time to see our sister off.${prompt}
  7688: |-
    Yeah...
    After all, she's still our big sister.
    That will neverrr change.${prompt}
  7689: |-
    Exactly.
    We're not just hunters of sin.
    We're also guardians of those we love.${prompt}
  7690: |-
    Why, this brings back memorrries.
    The daughters of the Mithran Tracker I met twenty years ago have also chosen the life of the sin hunter.${prompt}

  8161: Oh, does the luck-wuck of the A.M.A.N. know no bounds!?${prompt}
  8162: This slightly repurposed Maquette Abdhaljs - Legion has undergone a variety of improvementarus by some of our association's most skilled thaumaturges.${prompt}
  8163: Steel yourselves for our latestaru creation--Ambuscade!${prompt}
  8164: In Ambuscade, you'll square off againstaru a bevy of foes just chomping at the bit to see you torn into itty-bitty pieces!${prompt}
  8165: Every month (Earth time), new challengers enter the arena, providing different challenges from the month before.${prompt}
  8166: Now, now, wipe that dribble off your chin, for there are a couple hoops-woops we're going to make you jump through before you can join.${prompt}

  8171: And now, I would like to discuss the rewards.${prompt}
  8172: Simply put, all you need to know is that victory in Ambuscade will reward you with a special currency known as hallmarks.${prompt}

  8175: It goes withoutaru saying that there are special rewards available in exchange for badges of gallantry, too.${prompt}
  8176: I can see your lips quivering at the thought of receiving such extraordinary spoils!${prompt}
  8177: Be advised-wised in advance that you will lose all your hallmarks and badges of gallantry once the Ambuscade has switched to new content.${prompt}
  8178: (...And I'm not supposed to tell you this, but the rewards change as the Ambuscade does.)${prompt}
  8179: That's the long and short--mostly long--of it. Now get those items and try your luck!${prompt}
