    I am to be released to this world for the first time in an age.
    Is this reason to celebrate, or despair...?${prompt}
  7984: In any event...${prompt}
  7985: What is going on here?${prompt}
  7986: Ah, my successor has come.${prompt}
  7987: 'I sought to master the way of the samurai, and traveled to the Far East for training. By the time I had gained the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and returned to my home, the Great War had begun.${prompt}'
  7988: When I think on it, my life has been a long road of trials. But to see the arrival of my successor makes me feel that all has not been in vain.${prompt}
  7989: |-
    You have my gratitude.
    Farewell, ${item-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt}
  7990: '...${prompt}'
  7991: It has been a hard path to reach this point.${prompt}
  7992: |-
    But your journey in the way of the samurai has just begun.
    You have yet to attain perfection.
    Let us continue your training...${prompt}
  7993: |-
    ...
    At long last, you have arrived.${prompt}
  7994: I was not convinced you were serious about completing this trial...${prompt}
  7995: You have proven me wrong...${prompt}
  7996: I have heard of your coming.${prompt}
  7997: You are to be the new master of this hammer of war?${prompt}
  7998: |-
    Every time ${item-singular: 0[2]} is reborn it gains a new wielder, who ultimately must pass it on to a successor.
    I have swung this hammer for more than eight hundred years. I never wished to part with it.${prompt}
  7999: "However, there is little meaning in me keeping it now. \nIf you will wield this weapon for a just cause, I hand its power over to you.${prompt}"
  8000: |-
    Now, take the hammer and go!
    Just be careful with how you handle it.
    Do not let its might crush you as well...${prompt}
  8001: '...${prompt}'
  8002: My might is yours to wield.${prompt}
  8003: Go forth and experience the destructive power that laid low the Earth Serpent...${prompt}
  8004: |-
    ...
    So, you have found me.${prompt}
  8005: |-
    I must give you my thanks.
    I have been freed from the hell of Dynamis and can regain my true power once again.${prompt}
  8006: And now...${prompt}
  8007: Hwaah!${prompt}
  8008: Just when I thought I had finally returned to this world, I find you standing here, ready to snatch my precious staff away.${prompt}
  8009: |-
    Well, it's for the best, I suppose.
    In my current state, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is nothing more than an ornament, its power going to waste.${prompt}
  8010: |-
    I entrust this staff to you!
    Take up ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${name-player}, and bind it to you in a contract of blood!${prompt}
  8011: |-
    I take my leave of you now.
    I only wish that I was able to stay a little longer...${prompt}
  8012: '...${prompt}'
  8013: I am yours to wield.${prompt}
  8014: |-
    But you are not yet my master.
    By watching your actions from this time onwards, I will decide if you are worthy of the title...${prompt}
  8015: |-
    ...
    You have discovered my resting place.${prompt}
  8016: |-
    The prison of souls has let loose its shackles, and I am free to loose arrows in this world once more.
    My thanks.${prompt}
  8017: Ah, one more test of your patience...${prompt}
  8018: Where is this place?${prompt}
  8019: |-
    Of course. How could I forget.
    I am Ghebben. I was entrusted with this bow by a warrior of the Far East.${prompt}
  8020: |-
    Your hands tell me that your skill in archery is far from ordinary.
    ${item-singular: 0[2]} will fit snugly into your sure grasp.${prompt}
  8021: |-
    However, this bow belongs to Sir Nasu, the warrior of whom I spoke.
    You must remember that you are merely its keeper for a time.${prompt}
  8022: Farewell...${prompt}
  8023: '...${prompt}'
  8024: |-
    It is an honor to be owned by a just master.
    Sir Ghebben was a truly splendid archer.${prompt}
  8025: |-
    You are now the one to draw me in battle.
    I will be at your side on any road you choose to travel, along with the destructive power of my arrows.${prompt}
  8026: |-
    ...
    We finally meet.${prompt}
  8027: I am now free from the pit of Dynamis to spit fire in this world once again.${prompt}
  8028: But I must ask you to wait before taking me into your possession...${prompt}
  8029: |-
    Why'd you have to go and wake me up? I was having the most relaxing sleep.
    Oh, this place looks familiar...${prompt}
  8030: Hm? You think you're the one who's going to take up my gun?${prompt}
  8031: 'You do seem to have a fair eye for marksmanship. And ${item-singular: 0[2]} would look perfect nestled in the crook of your arm...${prompt}'
  8032: Well, I have no more use for this weapon, so I guess you can have it. But there is one thing I want you to remember.${prompt}
  8033: This gun is a fearsome weapon that unleashes a blast upon your enemies many thousands of times greater in strength than the tiny effort it takes you to pull the trigger. Needless to say, be careful who you aim it at...${prompt}
  8034: '...${prompt}'
  8035: A weapon has no will of its own. But it was made for a purpose.${prompt}
  8036: Take me to a new battlefield, a new arena for the hunt...${prompt}
  8037: |-
    ...
    I am saved.${prompt}
  8038: Silenced for too long in the prison of Dynamis, I can once again let my brazen call echo through this land!${prompt}
  8039: A few more moments, if you please...${prompt}
  8040: |-
    Hello there.
    I am Terounalivet, a military musician of the Hydra Corps.${prompt}
  8041: |-
    You've never heard of me?
    Before joining the army I was quite the famous bard, mobbed by fans in every town I passed through.${prompt}
  8042: 'To be completely truthful, I am heartbroken to be giving up the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the most famous of instruments, even to a fellow bard.${prompt}'
  8043: But an instrument only shows its true worth when being played. This horn should be delighted to be passed on to such a talent as yourself.${prompt}
  8044: She has a capricious soul, but do treat her well. And do not forget that even without a raging battle, you can still play a tune for the simple enjoyment of those around you...${prompt}
  8045: '...${prompt}'
  8046: He was a wonderful performer.${prompt}
  8047: |-

  11339: |-
    What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo!
    Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!${prompt}
  11340: |-
    We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers.

  11342: |-
    Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo.
    Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom.
    It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!${prompt}
  11343: The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!${prompt}
  11344: |-
    In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign.
    Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.${prompt}
  11345: Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...${prompt}
  11346: |-
    King Kupofried was greatly dismayed.
    How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?${prompt}
  11347: In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.${prompt}
  11348: “Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo,” he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.${prompt}
  11349: |-
    Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin.
    A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?${prompt}
  11350: |-
    We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition.
    We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!${prompt}

  11453: The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called “Voidwalkers.” Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt}
  11454: |-
    Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.
    This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt}
  11455: Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt}
  11456: A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt}
  11457: Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt}
  11458: |-
    Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.
    Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt}
  11459: Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt}
  11460: Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt}
  11461: However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt}
  11462: |-
    When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.
    These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt}
  11463: Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt}
  11464: The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt}
  11465: |-
    Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.
    Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt}
  11466: As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt}
  11467: Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt}
  11468: Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt}
  11469: After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt}
  11470: Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt}
  11471: Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  11472: While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  11473: Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt}
  11474: Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt}
  11475: Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt}
  11476: Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt}
  11477: Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt}
  11478: The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt}
  11479: The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt}
  11480: Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt}
  11481: 'Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt}'

    Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts.
    By infusing atmacite to one's body using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.${prompt}
  11483: Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}
  11484: Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.${prompt}
  11485: Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.${prompt}
  11486: As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.${prompt}
  11487: Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.${prompt}
  11488: 'Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level ${number: 0}.${prompt}'
