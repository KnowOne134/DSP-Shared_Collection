  0: Hm? You don't look like someone from around here.${prompt}
  1: My name is Lion. I'm an adventurer like you.${prompt}
  2: I, too, came here to pick up the offering to the Yagudo.${prompt}
  3: It's terrible! The Yagudo are just using the frightened Tarutaru to get more and more supplies.${prompt}
  4: The representatives here in Heavens Tower won't listen to me, but I'm certain that most of the weapons and food that are offered are just sold to other beastmen around Vana'diel.${prompt}
  5: With all this talk of a new leader bringing the beastman forces together, I just hope that Windurst opens its eyes in time.${prompt}
  6: Work for the Yagudo... Can you believe it?${prompt}
  7: This is the Star Tree Orchard. The hard, brown fruitaru that grows on these trees is used to make the heads of the Cardian guards.${prompt}
  8: It may give you a shocktaru, but an itsy-bitsy seedling grew into a humongous star tree! This humongous star tree!${prompt}
  9: You see, the Great Star Tree is the guardian of all Windurst! A miracle it is, a miracle!${prompt}
  10: |-
    My star tree has a first name, it's S★T★A★R♪
    My star tree has a second name, it's T★R★E★E♪${prompt}
  11: My buddy in the Rhinostery told me that singing to plants helps them grow all biggy-wiggy.${prompt}
  12: We love harvesting the shiny, hard, smooth, ripe starfruitaru.${prompt}
  13: But there is always a fight over who picks the biggest, juiciest, grandest, most lovely one!${prompt}
  14: The star tree is a plant, very delicate-cate. Clean and magical, the water must be, or it will die-die.${prompt}
  15: Before the war-war, outside of Windurst there were star trees as well. But now disappeared, they all have-ave...${prompt}
  16: We don't make any new types of plants here, like they do at the Rhinostery. We just plant the seeds from the Great Star Tree, and grow more and more and more new baby star trees!${prompt}
  17: Welcome to Heavens Tower--a sanctuary to guide our thoughts and dreams and dreams and thoughts to heaven.${prompt}
  18: We are inside the Great Star Tree--the protector of Windurst and the bridge between the heavens and Vana'diel.${prompt}
  19: On the highest-driest-bo-biased floor of this tower, you will find the Planetarium and the Star Spring. There, one can see all the stars-jars-bo-bars in the heavens.${prompt}
  20: The Star Sibyl uses the power-cower-toe-tower of those stars in the Star Spring to see all the way into the future.${prompt}
  21: Adventurers from foreign countries are allowed access to the basement and first floor of Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  22: The Star Sibyl believes that the Great Star Tree is not only the property of Windurst, but the property of all beings in Vana'diel.${prompt}
  23: Somebody somewhere said something about rubbing the Great Star Tree's roots for good luck. Well, that's just rubbing-rubbish!${prompt}
  24: You don't have to touch, feel, stroke, or pet anything to have the tree help your dreams travel to the heavens.${prompt}
  25: On the basement floor you will find the orchard, where new star trees are raised.${prompt}
  26: Don't go running round-around and causing motion-commotion down there. The star trees need their peace and quietaru.${prompt}
  27: What's this? Are you under the delusion that I, Zubaba, head lady-in-waiting, would let a slimy adventurer like you journey into our holy Planetarium!?${prompt}
  28: And talk to the Star Sibyl? Hah! I've never heard of anything so absurd! The personage with whom you seek audience is the Dawn Goddess Reincarnate, you impertinent scally-wally-wag!${prompt}
  29: Long ago, the Star Sibyl lost someone very close...but even with that burden, she has never failed to fulfill her duties to the people of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  30: To quietly watch over her...that is all we ladies-in-waiting can do. That is how it has been, and that is how it shall be.${prompt}
  31: I apologize, but no matter how many itty-bitty battles you have fought for Windurst, our trust must be earned in other ways here.${prompt}
  32: Our hopes and beliefs lie fully in the Star Sibyl. Only she can duly-truly guide us.${prompt}
  33: You want to become a lady-in-waiting? Well, there are many conditions. First of all, you must be a female Tarutaru. Then, you must possess neither magic nor strength, and must free yourself of all desires.${prompt}
  34: (...but to tell you the truth, I sure desire a juicy-wuicy mutton tortilla right now.)${prompt}
  35: Like, guess what? The other day when I was running one of baba-Zubaba's errands to the planetarium...I saw...(the Star Sibyl!)${prompt}
  36: She was like, just sitting there gazing off into the Star Spring. I bet she was looking into the future, or something! Isn't that just the coolest?${prompt}
  37: The only one of us who actually has the HONOR to interact with the Star Sibyl is the lovely-dovey, kind and CARING head lady, ZUBABA.${prompt}
  38: (That old prune still brags about how she protected the Star Sibyl in the Great War twenty years ago!)${prompt}
  39: The young ladies-in-waiting these days are more interested in gabby-gabbing and party-wartying than their duties... What is Heruru to do?${prompt}
  40: Where will their small talk get them when there's a real emergency?${prompt}
  41: You should lock up all memories of this place in the back of your mini-mini miniscule brain and throw away the key. Understood?${prompt}
  42: Nothing good ever comes from curiosity. Even the most beautiful love story can be packed with putrid poison for the mind.${prompt}
  43: The Star Reading ceremony is not something that hippy-hoppy-happens every day.${prompt}
  44: Once a year, the five ministers gather here to view the events of the upcoming months. The ceremony requires extreme concentration and drilly-drooly-drains the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  45: Whenever I sneak a peek into the Star Spring, I always, always get this strangey-wangey feeling.${prompt}
  46: It's a feeling like...one day I will become one of those countless, countless stars fleeting and floating in the heavens...${prompt}
  47: Th-th-th-this is the Vestal Vestibule for the Star Sibyl's ladies-in-waiting. I-I-I guess you could call it the second floor of Heavens T-T-T-Tower. <Cower>${prompt}
  48: A-a-a-above, you will find the planetarium. M-m-m-many travel here to see it, b-b-b-but only those chosen are allowed to go anywhere near there. <Scare>${prompt}
  49: Uh...um... My name is Kinono. This is my first week as a lady-in-waiting.${prompt}
  50: I pledge my loyalty to the Sto--Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  51: Who is the Star Sibyl? I don't know either! But ya know, I'd love to meet her someday!${prompt}
  52: At my age, all they let me do is make beds. I have a good ten years 'til they let me do something important like take out the Star Sibyl's trash!${prompt}
  53: I apologize, but no matter how many itty-bitty battles you have fought for Windurst, our trust must be earned in other ways here.${prompt}
  54: However, I can tell you this. Thanks to you, the Star Sibyl is feeling a little bitter-better, and most of the ladies-in-waiting are relieved.${prompt}
  55: N-now that the Star Sibyl is feeling better, we can get back to our everyday w-w-work.${prompt}
  56: We must pr-pray harder to make sure that something like this never-ever happens again!${prompt}
  57: You see. Lady ZUBABA is not as terrible as YOU thought. We ladies-in-waiting WORK just as HARD as you adventurers. Why don't YOU try doing our job for a day?${prompt}
  58: (I guarantee you wouldn't last an hour without Zubaba making you achy-break out in tears, begging to go home!)${prompt}
  59: Yeah! The Star Sibyl is, like, back on her feetsy-toes again! You go girl!${prompt}
  60: I can't wait to see her back, gazing into the Star Spring...but not for too long, you know. She needs her rest!${prompt}
  61: Cool! So this is the Star Spring!${prompt}
  62: Huh. I don't see any stars... What? Is it cloudy out?${prompt}
  63: Did you come-come here to see-vee the stars in the Star Spring?${prompt}
  64: Well, you're out of luck, then. Only those chosen-hosen can make-ache their way through the magic doors leading up there.${prompt}
  65: |-
    SHHHHHHHH!
    (Your prayers...transported from...spring directly to...Sibyl. She...uses...Star Spring to convey...prayers to...heavens.)${prompt}
  66: |-
    SHHHHHHHH!
    (Don't forget...gratitude to...Star Sibyl in...prayers.)${prompt}
  67: You say you want to go to the second floor? No, no. Not you. You'll have to bust your britches a little bit harder if you want get past that magic door.${prompt}
  68: Missions! Do some missions, raise your rank, and maybe...just maybe, they'll let you by!${prompt}
  69: You want to know more about missions? Well, mosey on over to any gatehouse and ask a guard!${prompt}
  70: You say you want to go to the second floor? No, no. Not you. They never let any foreigners up there!${prompt}
  71: There's a magic door blocking the way to the staircase, and only people reeeally important can pass through. And that doesn't mean you!${prompt}
  72: Before the Great War, there were no Sibyl Guards. The only ones living in this damp-ified, dark-ful tower were the Star Sibyl, the ladies-in-waiting, and...${prompt}
  73: |-
    ...the HUUUUU-ndreds of TERRIFYING magic dolls!!!
    Ha ha ha! Did I scar-ify you? That one always gets the kids. Hee hee hee.${prompt}
  74: I'm not sure of the details, but the guards protecting the Star Sibyl are supposedly the children of Mithra who died in the Great War.${prompt}
  75: I wonder why that is. Maybe they feel they are in debt to her...${prompt}
  76: Whoa... It's busting strrraight through the ceiling!${prompt}
  77: I can see what my mom meant when she told me to grow up big and strong like the Grrreat Star Tree! You can feel the powerrr!${prompt}
  78: 'Hey, is that ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}?${prompt}'
  79: Wow! Does that mean you saw the Star Spring?${prompt}
  80: |-
    Do you want to warp to the first floor?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    Not now.${prompt}
  81: I sense a great strrrength running deep within your soul. Will you not use that strrrength to help us build the Windurst of tomorrow?${prompt}
  82: I believe that you can make a difference.${prompt}
  83: I'll let it pass this time, but this is not a place for scrrruffy adventurers like yourself to be wandering arrround in.${prompt}
  84: You can get back to the firrrst floor through that portal there, so I suggest you move on before you cause any rrreal trouble.${prompt}
  85: Why are all the Sibyl Guards Mithra, you ask? That's easy. We are offerings to the Star Sibyl from ourrr chieftainness.${prompt}
  86: Ha ha... Lady Semih Lafihna always has a cat fit when anyone puts it that way. Forget what I said. Ha ha...${prompt}
  87: |-
    Sibyl Guard Vahn Paineesha!
    I will personally punish any who even think of harming the Starrr Sibyl.${prompt}
  88: After the Great Warrr twenty years ago, Windurst was in ruins. I was just a kitten, and I had lost my home and my parrrents.${prompt}
  89: It was our chieftainness and the Starrr Sibyl who took me in and gave me a place to live. Some people talk ill of their relationship, but I have nothing but utter rrrespect for the two.${prompt}
  90: |-
    Sibyl Guard, Shaz Norem!
    I will not tolerrrate any who attempt to deface Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  91: As you can see, we Sibyl Guards are not a chosen few.${prompt}
  92: This is a position we werrre given, and we must trrrain as hard as anyone else. We can't let down the people who gave us this job.${prompt}
  93: There is no stopping tomorrow from coming, but there is no guarantee that the tomorrow that comes will be a bright one.${prompt}
  94: To create a better tomorrow...that is why we Mithra left our jungle home for this city. And we will not rrreturn until we have accomplished our task.${prompt}
  95: Compared to most independent Mithra, we Sibyl Guards get along extremely well. If we ever disagree on something we just have a catfight, and everything is solved.${prompt}
  96: Whoeverrr wins the fight wins the argument!${prompt}
  97: Welcome to Heavens Tower. Are you the adventurer who came for your mission orders?${prompt}
  98: '...You''re rank 2?${prompt}'
  99: This next mission is really, really, rea～lly important, and will test your abilities in many different ways.${prompt}
  100: I am not sure that someone of your rank will be able to handle it...${prompt}
  101: Oh, I know I shouldn't...but you di～d complete the Rhinostery mission...${prompt}
  102: And if you were good enough to do that, then I gue～ss you can handle the next one.${prompt}
  103: And you are...${prompt}
  104: Do you know Lady Semih Lafihna?${prompt}
  105: Kupipi, what business does ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] have here?${prompt}
  106: ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] is here to accept ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] next mission from Heavens Tower...but ${choice-player-gender}[he's/she's] still only rank 2.${prompt}
  107: ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] is here to accept ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] next mission from Heavens Tower...but ${choice-player-gender}[he's/she's] still only rank 2.${prompt}
  108: I don't need the details, Kupipi. Show me ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] file.${prompt}
  109: This is a nice resume. It seems as if you fight betterrr than you look.${prompt}
  110: '...And it also seems that today is not your day.${prompt}'
  111: Kupipi. Process this adventurer's mission paperrrs.${prompt}
  112: 'Relay ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] orders to ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] and give ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] ${keyitem-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}'
  113: |-
    Umm...
    Uh... Understood!${prompt}
  114: I didn't think we would meet again so soon.${prompt}
  115: I can sense many good things within you. Let's see how you manage with this new task.${prompt}
  116: Kupipi. I'll leave the rest to you.${prompt}
  117: Yes, now where was I...?${prompt}
  118: According to the pact constructed by the three countries, Windurst is allowed a consulate in both Bastok and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  119: Your next mission is to travel to the consulates in these two countries and gather any information you can. Which country you travel to first is up to you.${prompt}
  120: You may receive various tasks from them, so use that as a means of gathering useful information.${prompt}
  121: When you have learned something interesting, return back here to Windurst with your report.${prompt}
  122: The quickest way to get to either of the two countries is by the ferry that departs from Mhaura.${prompt}
  123: Do you have a～ny questions?${prompt}
  124: |-
    A～ny questions?
    ${selection-lines}
    I got it the first time.
    Could you go over that one more time?${prompt}
  125: |-
    Are you su～re?
    The Republic of Bastok in the west and the Kingdom of San d'Oria in the north; journey to either one.${prompt}
  126: There, seek out the Windurstian consulate and obtain information from the consuls.${prompt}
  127: |-
    Hmm...
    Are you su～re you were listening?${prompt}
  128: San d'Oria in the north and Bastok in the west; travel to these two countries and meet the Windurstian consuls in each. They'll tell you what to do from there.${prompt}
  129: Don't forget that Windurst is a neutral country set on maintaining peace.${prompt}
  130: No matter what you are told in those other countries, you must remember that Windurst is not about to get involved in another Great War.${prompt}
  131: That is all.${prompt}
  132: Now skedaddle!${prompt}
  133: You will face many new hahdy-hahdships in zose fah-away lands.${prompt}
  134: Vhen you feel like you just can't take it anymore, remember how you gaht zis far, and sings might naht seem as bad as you sink zey ahre.${prompt}
  135: In the Great War, the three countries of Windurst, Bastok, and San d'Oria joined forces under the command of The Grand Duchy of Jeuno to defeat the Shadow Lord and his beastman forces.${prompt}
  136: Who would have thought that twenty years later Windurst would be all buddy-wuddying with the Yagudo?${prompt}
  137: |-
    Welcome back, adventurer!
    Hm? What is that you have there? Is it a pre～sent? A present for Kupi...${prompt}
  138: '...Oh. Your report. You were told to deliver it to the Star Sibyl?${prompt}'
  139: I see. Well, we can't have common adventurers like yo～u dirtying up our sacred to～wer, so I will take your report to the Star Sibyl myself. ${prompt}
  140: |-
    You're still here?
    What? You say you're entitled to some kind of certificate?${prompt}
  141: 'Oh yes, it must have slipped my mind. Here is your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}. Now you are a full-fledged adventurer.${prompt}'
  142: |-
    You're still here?
    You can go home now.${prompt}
  143: |-
    What? I sound upset?
    That's silly! Just because SO～MEONE didn't bring me back a present from their mission doesn't mean Kupipi's in a bad mood...${prompt}
  144: You say you've been called by Lady Semih Lafihna, the Sibyl Guard?${prompt}
  145: You mean to tell me you've REA～LLY-WILLY been called by Lady Semih Lafihna? You?${prompt}
  146: |-
    Hmph. I guess I'll trust you this time.
    Use this ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} to gain access to the top floor. But don't forget to give that back!${prompt}
  147: When visiting the upper floors of the tower, you must be on your be～st behavior. Especially around the head lady-in-waiting, Zubaba!${prompt}
  148: 'And another piece of advice: be ca～reful when dealing with the other Sibyl Guards. There''s one in there with a lion''s temper!${prompt}'
  149: If you are looking for Lady Semih Lafihna, you will have to wait. She is currently with the Star Sibyl in her chambers.${prompt}
  150: Ah, I see you have already arrived. Did I keep you waiting?${prompt}
  151: Our fine cleric, Kupipi, didn't doubt that I had called you herrre, did she?${prompt}
  152: This is the Planetarium. By using the sacred Star Spring, one can see all the stars in the heavens.${prompt}
  153: When the Star Sibyl peers into this spring, she can decipher the movements of the stars, and reveal to us our futurrre.${prompt}
  154: We Sibyl Guards exist to protect that futurrre.${prompt}
  155: I showed the report you deliverrred to the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  156: Do not worry, as she had already sensed the imminent revival of the Shadow Lord.${prompt}
  157: However, for the sake of national security, we ask you to keep this information to yourself.${prompt}
  158: There is no reason to inform the public at this time. The wounds that the Tarutaru received twenty yearrrs ago still have not healed, and releasing this information now would only cause unwanted confusion.${prompt}
  159: As for you, you can go back to your adventuring. The Sibyl Guards will take the investigation from here.${prompt}
  160: Halt! Do not prrroceed any further!
  161: Lady Semih Lafihna has prohibited you from entering this arrrea!
  162: 'Ajido-Marujido! ${wait-animation: 1}'
  163: |-
    What is the meaning of this!?
    You are no longer allowed to have audiences with the Star Sibyl. Leave at once, traitorrr!${prompt}
  164: The leader of the most powerful War Warlocks in Windurst...a traitor? Give me a break!${prompt}
  165: Do you actually think that a mere group of kitty cats can save Windurst?${prompt}
  166: Well, I'm sure we can fare better than some powerrr-hungry minister with his head in a hole.${prompt}
  167: |-
    How--how dare you!
    Look around. Does the Windurst you see around you look peaceful and happy-wappy?${prompt}
  168: What is this?${prompt}
  169: Wait! Ajido-Marujido!${prompt}
  170: The pages... They're all blank. Is this some kind of joke?${prompt}
  171: Joke? Show those blank pages to the Star Sibyl, and see if she's laughing.${prompt}
  172: The Book of the Gods has gone blank! The broken Cardian soldiers are up to no good! And all Windurst has is an ancient, worn out, good-for-nothing army!${prompt}
  173: And you just sit here, with your tails between your legs!${prompt}
  174: Well, I'm tired of waiting! I, Ajido-Marujido, will save Windurst from these terrible-werrible times!${prompt}
  175: '...${prompt}'
  176: ${name-player}... I have a mission for you.${prompt}
  177: Follow that Tarutaru and find out what he is up to. Report to me when you do.${prompt}
  178: I cannot forgive any who endanger the peace of Windurst.${prompt}
  179: Orastery minister, Ajido-Marujido...${prompt}
  180: He's so determined to decipher the mystery behind the forbidden magic that he cannot see what is rrreally going on around him.${prompt}
  181: If it wasn't for the Sibyl Guards' strrrength in numbers, we would have had no chance against a powerful magician like Ajido-Marujido.${prompt}
  182: But, to tell you the trrruth, I think that Lady Semih Lafihna could have taken his little head off with one swipe of her claws.${prompt}
  183: Tarutaru are usually cowards, but once they get fired up, there's no contrrrolling them. They are even willing to make enemies of the Sibyl Guards in order to carrry out their silly plans.${prompt}
  184: Am I hurrrt? Oh, you don't need to worry about me. I think he went “easy” on us...${prompt}
  185: Don't let Lady Semih Lafihna hearrr I said this, but I don't think that little Tarutaru was one hundred percent wrong.${prompt}
  186: Both sides are thinking of Windurst's futurrre... I just wish therrre was some way we could be on the same side.${prompt}
  187: The Orastery minister returned to the firrrst floor via this portal.${prompt}
  188: If he's alrrready left Heavens Tower, you can prrrobably find him at the Orastery.${prompt}
  189: Have I seen the Orastery minister? He just stormed out of here a few minutes ago.${prompt}
  190: Don't ask m～e where he went. For all I know, he returned to the Orastery.${prompt}
  191: Currently, Lady Semih Lafihna is not in Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  192: Wait. She has just rrreturned.${prompt}
  193: Ah, I see you are back, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  194: Tell me what you have learrrned.${prompt}
  195: I see... So, Ajido-Marujido went all the way to Castle Oztroja.${prompt}
  196: And had an audience with their king!? How many of our country's laws does he have to brrreak to be satisfied?${prompt}
  197: I commend you on your fine work. I will report this information to the Star Sibyl at once.${prompt}
  198: And following that, I think I will personally deliver a grave warning to our rogue ministerrr.${prompt}
  199: You, for now, may rest. I sense another mission for you very soon.${prompt}
  200: The Yagudo have been living on this continent as long as the Tarutaru. Our conflict with the beastmen goes back that far.${prompt}
  201: The Yagudo are not as ignorant as many may think. In the Great Warrr, their tactics confused even our finest leaderrrs.${prompt}
  202: There must be some rrreason for them allowing the Orastery ministerrr to return unharmed.${prompt}
  203: Just because they are ministers doesn't mean we can allow them do as they please.${prompt}
  204: Perhaps it is time for the Sibyl Guards to take action and gatherrr up all the traitors in Windurst.${prompt}
  205: Many Mithra lost theirrr lives at Castle Oztroja...${prompt}
  206: The heaviest fighting came nearrr the cells where ourrr comrades were locked up.${prompt}
  207: Have you succeeded in proving your worth to Lady Semih Lafihna?${prompt}
  208: Keep it up, and you may just end up taking your orders directly from the Star Sibyl herself. Although by doing so, you will be creating enemies with many who serve our chieftainness...${prompt}
  209: Stars above...tell me...what am I to do?${prompt}
  210: ' Tell me... Karaha-Baruha... We... I need...you...${prompt}'
  211: You say that the old...the head lady-in-waiting, Zubaba, requests your audience?${prompt}
  212: It must be a～ll the good things I told her about you! Don't screw up, or I'm the one who's going to pay!${prompt}
  213: |-
    You're la～te!
    Late late late late late!${prompt}
  214: You pathetic adventurers are never-ever on time!${prompt}
  215: You think that being late affects only you, my dear? Did you ever think of those who have to wait for you? Hmm?${prompt}
  216: And what of the people who have to wait for the people who are waiting for you? You see, your lack of punctuality creates problems for all of Vana'diel!${prompt}
  217: |-
    Are you paying attention, young ${choice-player-gender}[man/lady]?
    Very well. Let me tell you why I have summoned you here.${prompt}
  218: I have heard of your exploits from the young lady in the Clerical Chamber.${prompt}
  219: What we ladies-in-waiting need right now is an adventurer of good standing.${prompt}
  220: |-
    ...
    Let us retire to a place where we may converse in private.${prompt}
  221: My request concerns...the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  222: From generation to generation to generation to generation, the Star Sibyls inherit a mysterious ability to read the future from the stars that appear in the Star Spring.${prompt}
  223: The first time that a new Star Sibyl uses this power is during her inauguration on a day we call the Starway Solstice.${prompt}
  224: But during the Star Reading ceremony on her inauguration, the Sibyl learned of a terrible calamity that would befall all Windurst.${prompt}
  225: You are aware of the Great War that occurred twenty-wenty years ago, are you not?${prompt}
  226: The Star Sibyl had a vision of the war before it began.${prompt}
  227: She collapsed after beholding that vision, and remained speechless, shivering in her bed, for days.${prompt}
  228: All we ladies-in-waiting could do was kneel by her side and pray for her quick-wick recovery.${prompt}
  229: '...And now history is repeating itself.${prompt}'
  230: Ever since Ajido-Marujido brought that blank copy of the Book of the Gods here, the Star Sibyl has been gazing into the Star Spring every night. And then last night...${prompt}
  231: She collapsed, just as she did twenty years ago! Oh, what did the Star Sibyl do to deserve this?${prompt}
  232: However, before she collapsed, she received some sort of sign from the stars.${prompt}
  233: It was a sign that revealed that something malevolent is stirring in the central tower of the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt}
  234: The same central tower that has been sealed since the end of the Great War.${prompt}
  235: What is down there, you ask? Well, part of the talisman that seals Castle Zvahl, and...${prompt}
  236: No, the only thing that matters is the talisman. It is located in a small, small room in the central tower.${prompt}
  237: |-
    Hold out your hand.
    This is a charm that will allow you to enter that room.${prompt}
  238: Keep it safe, for this charm is exceedingly important. If it were to fall into the wrong hands...${prompt}
  239: Now, be off with you. The sooner you come back with good news, the sooner the Star Sibyl will recover.${prompt}
  240: Surely an adventurer of your stature knows of the Horutoto Ruins. I wish for you to travel to its central tower and rid the place of the wicked creatures that lurk below.${prompt}
  241: In the past, we have had other adventurers travel there to confirm the Star Sibyl's readings. However, recently there has been a rise in monster activity in the ruins.${prompt}
  242: I would like you to travel to the central tower of the Horutoto Ruins and check up on the safety of the talisman that seals Castle Zvahl.${prompt}
  243: That talisman is one of three used by Windurst, Bastok, and San d'Oria to prevent the Shadow Lord from ever returning. If anything has happened to it...${prompt}
  244: At times like this I feel so powerless... Please help the Star Sibyl! You are our only hope!${prompt}
  245: I cannot see why Lady Zubaba would ask a blimey-grimy adventurer like you to help her.${prompt}
  246: Now don't go off blabby-wabbing all that you've heard here today. This matter is between you, Lady Zubaba, and the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  247: One must meet many conditions to become a lady-in-waiting. First of all, one must be a female Tarutaru. Then, one must possess neither magic nor strength, and must free themselves of all desires.${prompt}
  248: Other than pray and gab and gossip, there is nothing much we can do...${prompt}
  249: |-
    What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
    The Star Sibyl's collapsed! What are we gonna do?${prompt}
  250: If it would save the Star Sibyl, I'd like, sell my soul to the Shadow Lord!${prompt}
  251: The Star Reading ceremony performed at the Star Spring brain-drains much energy from the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  252: From what I hear, the Sibyl rides on starlight that takes her to a place where she can see our futures. It's just too difficult for a lady-in-waiting like me to imagine!${prompt}
  253: After the Great War, the Star Sibyl tried to hidey-wide her fatigue from us.${prompt}
  254: Lately I can sense the same fatigue in her eyes. It's all because of that evil-weevil Orastery minister!${prompt}
  255: You remember when we had our visit from that overly obnoxious Orastery minister, don't you?${prompt}
  256: Well, I heard the captain of the Sibyl Guards, Semih Lafihnam, is on the trail of that fraudulent fiend. It looks like his time to pay has come.${prompt}
  257: The Star Reading ceremony is usually not something that hippy-hoppy-happens every day.${prompt}
  258: However, before she collapsed, the Star Sibyl was down at the Star Spring every night. I wander-whimper-wonder what she was wally-weary-worried aboutaru...${prompt}
  259: The reason that the light of the stars is so dim is because they are so far, far, far away. If you were to get close to them, you would be blinded by their magnificent light.${prompt}
  260: I always thought that being surrounded by such a powerful, powerful force, one day she would collapse...but to think that I was actually right! Oh, Star Sibyl! Forgive me!${prompt}
  261: Th-th-th-this is a special hall for the Star Sibyl's ladies-in-waiting. I-I-I guess you could call it the second floor of Heavens T-T-T-Tower. <Cower>${prompt}
  262: |-
    H-h-h-have you talked to Lady Zubaba, yet?
    P-p-p-please speak with her as soon as possible, f-f-f-for the Star Sibyl's sake. <Quake>${prompt}
  263: U-um, my daddy-pappy said that the only way somebody-buddy could get into the central tower of the Harryto--Horutoto Ruins was by entering through the east tower in East Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  264: But there are three magic doors that can only be opened by using the power of three magicians...or at least that's what my daddy-pappy said.${prompt}
  265: |-
    <Sigh>
    I wish I they'd let me take care of the Star Sibyl, rather than put me on bedmaking duty...${prompt}
  266: If it was the Sibyl's bed, I would be slap-happy, but no! I get stuck with old Lady Zubaba's bed!${prompt}
  267: |-
    You're late!
    Late late late late late!${prompt}
  268: You were gone for ever so long... How were we to know you were not devoured by monsters!?${prompt}
  269: Well, at least you returned in one piece. Now inform me of what you discovered.${prompt}
  270: '...I see. So the talisman was intact. Then the sign must have been...${prompt}'
  271: Oh, but that is nothing for you to fuss-muss over. I will relay your findings to the Star Sibyl once she awakens.${prompt}
  272: I am positive that she will begin her recovery when she hears that the talisman remains in its rightful place.${prompt}
  273: However, I still do not understand why...${prompt}
  274: Well, something is amiss--there is no question of that. And my Tarutaru intuition tells me that awful Orastery minister is behind it all.${prompt}
  275: I still cannot put my finger on what is really going on.${prompt}
  276: However, I do know that something is amiss--there is no question of that. And my Tarutaru intuition tells me that awful Orastery minister is behind it all.${prompt}
  277: You need not worry any longer. Our prayers have reached the Star Sibyl. She now sleeps peacefully in her chambers.${prompt}
  278: The Star Sibyl will be resting for the next few days.${prompt}
  279: You can trust us ladies-in-waiting to take good carey-wary of her.${prompt}
  280: These last few days have been terrible-wearable for us ladies-in-waiting.${prompt}
  281: If I were a strong adventurer like you, I would not hesitate to dive deep into a monster-infested crazy mazey for the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  282: The Star Sibyl's looking tons better. Whenever she's down she keeps coming back for more. You go girl!${prompt}
  283: I must be, like, the power-wower of the Great Star Tree! I prayed every night, and now my prayers have been answered. It's like, whoa!${prompt}
  284: I may be imagining it, but as of late the light emanating from the Star Spring has dimmed ever-so slightly. Oh, WISE lady ZUBABA, what are we to DO?${prompt}
  285: (Like she'd know. It is said that the Star Sibyl is the reincarnation of the Dawn Goddess. Maybe the Sibyl and the Star Spring are connected in some way...)${prompt}
  286: Have you heard if the Orastery minister has been captured yetaru? Oh where, oh where, could Lady Semih Lafihna have gone?${prompt}
  287: ${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Miss] ${name-player}, please remember, just because that minister is a terrible man doesn't mean all Tarutaru are.${prompt}
  288: I heard that our overtly obsessed Orastery minister traveled to meet the Yagudo king.${prompt}
  289: If only the Yagudo had eaten him up for dinner!${prompt}
  290: Don't let Lady Zubaba know that I said this, but I heard the Star Sibyl tumbling-mumbling-grumbling in her sleep.${prompt}
  291: She was cooing-crying-calling out the name of a summoner who passed many years ago...${prompt}
  292: There was nothing wrong with the talisman in the Horutoto Ruins, was there?${prompt}
  293: I shudder-butter at the thought of having to see the chaos that war brings again and again.${prompt}
  294: Y-you m-made it back s-safe and s-sound! Kinono is so relieved!${prompt}
  295: The Star Sibyl is looking much better-wetter! Now I can get back to concentrating on making Lady Zubaba's bed... <Sigh>${prompt}
  296: Th-th-th-this is the Vestal Vestibule for the Star Sibyl's ladies-in-waiting. I-I-I guess you could call it the second floor of Heavens T-T-T-Tower. <Cower>${prompt}
  297: I-I-I see you made it back from the ruins in one piece. H-h-h-have you already reported to the head lady-in-waiting. <Fainting>${prompt}
  298: Late again, are we, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/miss] ${name-player}?${prompt}
  299: Well, no matter. I have no time to listen to your idle excuses. I need you to travel once more to the central tower of the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt}
  300: I have learned from my sources that the tower is once again overrun with squirming vermin.${prompt}
  301: It may be in ruins, but ever since the first Star Sibyl sealed it, the central tower has been a place very sacred and important to Windurst.${prompt}
  302: And that is all the more reason to have you journey down there and cleanse our holy tower.${prompt}
  303: 'If you understand your mission, then be off with you. Do not forget to bring back three ${item-plural: 1[2]} as proof of your work.${prompt}'
  304: Journey to the central tower of the Horutoto Ruins and rid the place of those pernicious-vicious vermin.${prompt}
  305: 'If you understand your mission, then be off with you. Do not forget to bring back three ${item-plural: 1[2]} as proof of your work.${prompt}'
  306: Well, well, well. I am impressed that a mere adventurer such as yourself was able to carry out my biddy-bidding.${prompt}
  307: If you ever wish another respite from your wastrel existence, then I will arrange some more honest work for you.${prompt}
  308: Strictly speaking, adventurers are forbidden to enter the central tower of the Horutoto Ruins. We make exceptions, however, since adventurers make such efficient monster exterminators.${prompt}
  309: The Star Sibyl is troubled over whether to completely close off the ruins to all travelers or not.${prompt}
  310: The door to the Vestal Chambers is locked shut.${prompt}
  311: To get to the Star Sibyl's chambers, you must pass through the Planetarium and enter through the door in the back.${prompt}
  312: No, no. You don't need to say anything. I already know why you are here.${prompt}
  313: I～'m the one who wrote the star crested summons that you carry!${prompt}
  314: To think that the Star Sibyl would want to see a slimy-grimy adventurer! Have all my lessons in proper etiquette been in vain?${prompt}
  315: If you are entertaining even the slightest thought of beguiling our divine Lady, heads will roll, do you hear me!${prompt}
  316: Proceed to the door in the back.${prompt}
  317: Watch yourself in therrre, or you will have Lady Semih Lafihna to answerrr to!${prompt}
  318: Rrremember, you will be rrrepresenting your country. Act accordingly!${prompt}
  319: I shall pray to the starrrs that your mission is a success.${prompt}
  320: How go your adventures? Are you finally starting to make a name for yourself in Windurst?${prompt}
  321: If you don't feel like walking by that old battle axe, Zubaba, again...I recommend using the portal to the firrrst floor.${prompt}
  322: I am pleased that you came.${prompt}
  323: ${name-player}, was it not? I have heard of your accomplishments from Semih Lafihna.${prompt}
  324: After realizing how dedicated you have been in serving Windurst, I felt I must meet with you in person.${prompt}
  325: I am honored to have such a noble adventurer here in my presence. You are much younger than I imagined.${prompt}
  326: However, the reason I have called you here today is not solely for the purpose of greetings.${prompt}
  327: I, the Star Sibyl, hereby appoint you, ${name-player}, to the post of ambassadorial envoy in the Grand Duchy of Jeuno.${prompt}
  328: I apologize if I startled you with this sudden responsibility; however, the stars have already decided your fate.${prompt}
  329: I can sense the fire that burns deep within your heart. I feel that you will not disgrace the new title that I have given you.${prompt}
  330: No longer will you need to travel the perilous roads that accompany adventuring.${prompt}
  331: You have seen with your own eyes the evil that lurks in Vana'diel. Soon that evil will have spread to every corner of our beloved lands.${prompt}
  332: However, during these terrible times, Windurst must remain the beautiful, sublime mecca that it has become. To maintain this state, the cooperation of Jeuno is necessary.${prompt}
  333: This is why sending a trustworthy delegate, such as yourself, to represent our country is of extreme importance.${prompt}
  334: I am positive that your presence in Jeuno will benefit Windurst immeasurably.${prompt}
  335: Will you travel to the Grand Duchy of Jeuno as an envoy of Windurst?${prompt}
  336: |-
    Will you become an envoy?
    ${selection-lines}
    I would be honored.
    I'm sorry, but...${prompt}
  337: The will of the Star Sibyl is the will of the Dawn Goddess! How darrre you defy her!${prompt}
  338: Semih Lafihna... It is all right.${prompt}
  339: I sense that your spirit is as free as the wind. You feel that committing yourself as an envoy will strip you of that freedom.${prompt}
  340: It would be a lie to say that you would not be tied by this new responsibility.${prompt}
  341: However, I have seen within your soul. I know that you want to do what is right for the peace of your country.${prompt}
  342: It may be against your will, but I will appoint you as envoy to the Consulate of Windurst in Jeuno.${prompt}
  343: I am certain that, in time, the stars will lead you there.${prompt}
  344: I am grateful for your cooperation, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  345: Journey to the Embassy of Windurst in the Grand Duchy of Jeuno.${prompt}
  346: And do not forget, no matter where the stars lead you, I will always be watching.${prompt}
  347: To get to the Star Sibyl's chambers, you must pass through the Planetarium and enter through the door in the back.${prompt}
  348: The Sibyl is not taking what has happened very well...${prompt}
  349: Lady Semih Lafihna has also returned. You should hurry-scurry to the Planetarium.${prompt}
  350: So this is what the Star Sibyl had envisioned?${prompt}
  351: After twenty years of hard work to build bridges between Windurst and the beastmen, to have the Yagudo burn them down...${prompt}
  352: Proceed to the door in the back.${prompt}
  353: Watch yourself in therrre, or you will have Lady Semih Lafihna to answerrr to!${prompt}
  354: To tell you the truth, I neverrr thought Windurst and the Yagudo could get along anyway.${prompt}
  355: If any news of the theft leaks out of Heavens Tower, who knows what the Mithra will do.${prompt}
  356: During any Star Reading ceremony, we Sibyl Guarrrds are present in the hall with the ladies-in-waiting.${prompt}
  357: The same is true for the night on which the talisman was stolen. However, none of us saw any “bearerrrs of darkness.“${prompt}
  358: Have you hearrrd that on the night of the Star Reading ceremony, a “bearer of darkness” appearrred?${prompt}
  359: We Sibyl Guards do not rrrecall seeing anything out of the ordinary, but later that night is when the talisman sealing Castle Zvahl was stolen...${prompt}
  360: The talisman sealing Castle Zvahl has been stolen from the Horutoto Rrruins.${prompt}
  361: It is not clear yet who the perpetrators were, but we Sibyl Guards are rrready for any foe.${prompt}
  362: Who could have stolen the talisman from right underrr our tails?${prompt}
  363: Everybody is saying that it had to have been the Yagudo, but I'm going to take a shot in the dark and say it was...the Orastery ministerrr!${prompt}
  364: What? That's not a shot in the dark?${prompt}
  365: To think that a barrier that strong couldn't protect the talisman...${prompt}
  366: And now, even the Star Sibyl's power to read the stars is not enough to stop the rise of the Shadow Lord. What is Vana'diel coming to!?${prompt}
  367: So, once again history has begun to repeat itself. We ladies-in-waiting must get ready-steady for the coming battle.${prompt}
  368: No, no, no. I have to believe the remaining talismans are still intact.${prompt}
  369: The other day, I saw Lady Semih Lafihna return from one of her missions.${prompt}
  370: Now this is just a rumor, but I heard somebody saying that all five ministers have been called for a conference. What is to become of Windurst!?${prompt}
  371: Hey, did you, like, like, like get to see the Star Sibyl?${prompt}
  372: She must be feeling really bluesy-woozy. I wonder how she can take it all!${prompt}
  373: Just being able to READ the future doesn't mean having the power to CHANGE it...${prompt}
  374: (To think, after all these years, that oldy-moldy battle axe Zubaba was right.)${prompt}
  375: Twenty years ago we were able to prevent the baddie-waddies from taking control of the Great Star Tree.${prompt}
  376: But to think this “bearer of darkness” could just waltz right in here without anyone knowing! Woey-woe-woes is me!${prompt}
  377: You should lock up all memories of this incident in the back of your mini-mini miniscule brain and throw away the key. Understood?${prompt}
  378: No one outside of Heavens Tower, including your abominable adventuring acquaintances, needs to know that anything is wrong. Windurst must maintain its image of peace.${prompt}
  379: The balance in Vana'diel is beginning to stumble-rumble-crumble in ways I cannot even imagine.${prompt}
  380: |-
    This is a sign!
    A terrible, terrible sign!
    A sign that the world will soon be in ruin!${prompt}
  381: Even in this time of despair, the stars in the Star Spring twinkle-winkle softly, softly.${prompt}
  382: From the stars' point of view, our trouble-bubbles and wier-fears must seem as numerous and insignificant as a single blinkle-twinkle of light.${prompt}
  383: Th-th-th-this is the Vestal Vestibule for the Star Sibyl's ladies-in-waiting. I-I-I guess you could call it the second floor of Heavens T-T-T-Tower. <Cower>${prompt}
  384: W-w-w-we ladies-in-waiting are lost in the darkness of fear. P-p-p-please, ${name-player}, lead us to the light instead! <Dread>${prompt}
  385: U-um...I...um...I saw something the night the talisman was st-stolen.${prompt}
  386: The central tower of the Horutoto Ruins was glue--glowing. Weren't the devices in that tower destroyed tewl--twenty years ago?${prompt}
  387: I'm positive that no “bearer of darkness” was here that night.${prompt}
  388: How can I be so sure, you ask? Bedmaking gives me the bestest-westest view of the Starway Stairway!${prompt}
  389: Ah, ${name-player}. I have awaited your return.${prompt}
  390: While you were stationed in Jeuno, a great tragedy befell us here in Windurst.${prompt}
  391: Please explain the details, Semih Lafihna.${prompt}
  392: As you wish.${prompt}
  393: I am sure you have heard the stories of Windurst sealing Castle Zvahl with a talisman nearly twenty years ago.${prompt}
  394: This talisman was placed in the central tower of the Horutoto Ruins and sealed with a powerrrful barrier.${prompt}
  395: Howeverrr, on the night of the last full moon, this barrier was broken and the talisman stolen.${prompt}
  396: To think that the Yagudo now have the powerrr to nullify such magic!${prompt}
  397: Now, Semih Lafihna. We are not certain if the bandits were the Yagudo.${prompt}
  398: I was also visited by a bearer of darkness...${prompt}
  399: My apologies.${prompt}
  400: |-
    ${name-player}.
    To protect it from theft, the talisman used to seal Castle Zvahl was divided into three pieces and distributed to each of the three ruling nations of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  401: Checking up on San d'Oria and Bastok's talismans will be our mission. For you, we have another task.${prompt}
  402: Let me take it from here.${prompt}
  403: Je m'appelle Rukususu. I am zee minister of zee Rhinosterie.${prompt}
  404: At zee north-eastern tip of zee cursed Beaucedine Glacier, there are zee ruins of a lost city named Fei'Yin.${prompt}
  405: Long ago een Vana'diel, there existed a civilization as advanced as ours. I believe zat these ruins are from zat civilization.${prompt}
  406: |-
    Zilart...
    Zis is what zey called zemselves. We have also discovered similar ruins on zee western continent of Teriggan.${prompt}
  407: When you think of how long ago zis city was built, eet eez a miracle zat zey are even standing. Eet ees as eef they are being protected by some mysterious force...${prompt}
  408: Thirty years ago, a group of representatives from zee three countries of Windurst, Bastok, and San d'Oria was sent to Fei'Yin to investigate zee strange power zat lie dormant beneath zee ruins.${prompt}
  409: However, zee ruins were squirming with ghosts and strange machines. Zee expedition was a failure.${prompt}
  410: But after zee Great War, zee forces from zee three countries succeeded een ridding the place of all its unwanted inhabitants.${prompt}
  411: Zee arena located deep within Fei'Yin was zen chosen as zee location for a fourth seal to strengthen zee barrier placed on zee Northlands from zee eenside.${prompt}
  412: |-
    ${name-player}.
    I wish for you to travel to the Fei'Yin ruins.${prompt}
  413: See if the fourth seal that the minister speaks of is still intact.${prompt}
  414: |-
    Accept this mission?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  415: If you find anything...disturbing, use this new seal in place of the old.${prompt}
  416: The rumors of the revival of the Shadow Lord trouble me. However, if the barrier sealing the Northlands was to break, and the nether beasts were allowed to roam the peaceful lands of Vana'diel once more...${prompt}
  417: |-
    ${name-player}.
    May the stars guide you on this perilous journey!${prompt}
  418: |-
    I see...
    I realize this is a dangerous mission, and I will not force you to do anything beyond your will.${prompt}
  419: However, ${name-player}, I have confidence that the stars will guide you in the right direction. I will be waiting here for you.${prompt}
  420: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Ah, ${name-player}. I have awaited your return.${prompt}
  421: Will you travel to the Fei'Yin ruins and investigate the seal?${prompt}
  422: |-
    Accept this mission?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  423: You are truly ready to take on this dangerous mission to the cursed Northlands?${prompt}
  424: I am pleased to hear your change of heart. If you find anything disturbing with the situation there, use this new seal in place of the old.${prompt}
  425: |-
    ${name-player}.
    May the stars guide you on this perilous journey!${prompt}
  426: I am delighted at the news of your safe return.${prompt}
  427: What did you find in Fei'Yin? Was the seal...${prompt}
  428: |-
    I see...
    So the seal is no more...${prompt}
  429: If the beastmen were to lead a force of nether beasts into Windurst, we would be thrust back twenty years.${prompt}
  430: Your Holiness! We must stop the revival of the Shadow Lord at all costs! We cannot let historrry repeat itself!${prompt}
  431: |-
    I feel the same way, Semih Lafihna.
    Let us call forth the five ministers of Windurst. We need to work together in this time of despair.${prompt}
  432: You will be summoned when your next mission has been decided.${prompt}
  433: |-
    Go and prepare for your journey.
    The light of the great white star will guide you here when it is time.${prompt}
  434: To get to the Star Sibyl's chambers, you must pass through the Planetarium and enter through the door in the back.${prompt}
  435: I never thought that yo～u would ever accept such a da～ngerous mission. Kupipi's pretty impressed!${prompt}
  436: Every time the five ministers get together, there are usually fireworks. However, this time everyone was quiet. Especially the Orastery minister.${prompt}
  437: If he's not preaching, then you know something must be wrong.${prompt}
  438: Proceed to the door in the back.${prompt}
  439: Watch yourself in therrre, or you will have Lady Semih Lafihna to answerrr to!${prompt}
  440: Durrring the conference of ministers, it was decided not to dispatch any military forces.${prompt}
  441: Everyone thought that the Orastery minister would be against the decision, but he did not say a word.${prompt}
  442: It's times like these when you can tell the Tarutaru hate conflict.${prompt}
  443: The Shadow Lord's rrreturn is near, and they are having conferrrences... Unbelievable!${prompt}
  444: Do you rememberrr the “bearer of darkness” that brrroke into Heavens Tower on the night the talisman was stolen?${prompt}
  445: Maybe it was really a sign of the situation that looms before us!${prompt}
  446: I knew it! The beastmen were planning the rrreturn of the Shadow Lord all along.${prompt}
  447: The decision of the ministers keeps me from participating in any battle, but an adventurer like you...${prompt}
  448: My Mithra blood is boiling. I still have dreams about my motherrr being slaughtered by the beastmen.${prompt}
  449: And as orphans of the Great Warrr, I can tell you that all of my Sibyl Guard companions feel the same.${prompt}
  450: I finally realize why Rhinostery minister Rukususu has returned from her research in the Northlands.${prompt}
  451: She must have been investigating the Great War and found something out about the Shadow Lord.${prompt}
  452: Is it true that Bastok and San d'Oria also had their talismans stolen?${prompt}
  453: Then we have no time to losey-woosey! Something must be done immediately!${prompt}
  454: I heard from one of the other ladies that the Orastery minister was one of the most outspoken against another war.${prompt}
  455: He is probably just worried about having all his important books burned to a crunchy-crisp.${prompt}
  456: Hey, hey, hey! Did you already-wetty go see the Star Sibyl?${prompt}
  457: We ladies-in-waiting have a bet going that you will be called up as a member-wember of the group that goes after the Shadow Lord.${prompt}
  458: WISE and KIND head lady ZUBABA has reminded us that we must stay CALM in this time of despair.${prompt}
  459: (Well, that prune doesn't need to worry about me. As to what goes on within these walls, my mouth is shut as tight as a shall shell.)${prompt}
  460: Bringing back the dead, indeed! It is hard to believe that such heretic magic exists in our fair Vana'diel.${prompt}
  461: Though, that does remind me of that old legend of the magic doll...${prompt}
  462: Is it absolutely necessary for Windurst to take the lead in this sticky situation of strife?${prompt}
  463: If Jeuno would only take the first step, then Windurst could follow...safely...${prompt}
  464: The conference held by the five ministers was not as “exciting” as it usually is.${prompt}
  465: When one shakes-rakes-takes into consideration the relationship we have with the other countries of Vana'diel, Windurst cannot accord-award-afford to rush into matters.${prompt}
  466: At the last Star Reading, the Star Sibyl foresaw everlasting, lasting peace for Windurst, but I don't know if we can call our current situation peaceful.${prompt}
  467: Could it be the Star Sibyl was...?${prompt}
  468: Th-th-th-this is the Vestal Vestibule for the Star Sibyl's ladies-in-waiting. I-I-I guess you could call it the second floor of Heavens T-T-T-Tower. <Cower>${prompt}
  469: Th-th-th-there is much unrest among the ladies here. Wh-wh-wh-why, you ask? Th-th-th-the conference of ministers is over and done, and the f-f-f-fate of Windurst has been set. <Fret>${prompt}
  470: U-um...the conference of monst--ministers just finished.${prompt}
  471: I think s-some important insi--decisions were made. Good luck!${prompt}
  472: How can everybody-buddy be so cool and calm?${prompt}
  473: The Shadow Lord has returned, and I'm making beds!!!${prompt}
  474: I have been awaiting your return, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  475: It has been decided that Windurst will not take any military action against the Shadow Lord.${prompt}
  476: There are still too many unanswered questions. Any action now would erase what we have worked so hard to build with the Yagudo.${prompt}
  477: However, we must put a stop to the Shadow Lord's return. We cannot allow Vana'diel to be thrust back into a war.${prompt}
  478: That is where you come in.${prompt}
  479: I would like you to travel to Castle Zvahl and prevent the resurrection of the Shadow Lord.${prompt}
  480: I believe in you, ${name-player}. Let the stars guide you to victory on your celestial journey.${prompt}
  481: One great star has fallen...${prompt}

    For now, your duty is done.
    Until the stars call on you once again...${prompt}
  486: Well, well, well. I guess that all adventurers aren't that bad.${prompt}
  487: Don't get the wrong idea, now. I never said it was you.${prompt}
  488: I applaud you on your efforts in the Northlands. You are the pride of Windurst!${prompt}
  489: It is rrregrettable that you cannot be publicly honored for your deeds, but the Sibyl Guards all commend you on what you have accomplished for Windurst.${prompt}
  490: I am relieved to see you back in Windurst. When things settle down, please tell us of your adventures in the Northlands.${prompt}
  491: Now that you're back I can tell you...but when you were firrrst selected to go to the Northlands, I thought that was the last time we would everrr see you.${prompt}
  492: Don't take it the wrrrong way or anything. You made it back, didn't you?${prompt}
  493: I heard the news! Who would have thought that a simple adventurerrr could foil the plans of the beastmen?${prompt}
  494: I am honored to live and work in the same great countrrry as you, ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}!${prompt}
  495: Let me thank you for grrranting the wish deep within the hearts of all Mithra.${prompt}
  496: No longer will innocent children have to be the sacrifice of a meaningless war. Our prayers have been answerrred.${prompt}
  497: The Rhinostery minister, Lady Rukususu, has returned to the freezy-cold Northlands.${prompt}
  498: She said something about investigating the reason why the Shadow Lord suddenly reappeared. I wonder what really happened up there...${prompt}
  499: I heard that when the tell-tale talismans were stolen, adventurers from all around Vana'diel set out for the Northlands.${prompt}
  500: Crossing cultural boundaries, joining hands and paws for one great cause... What excitement! What romance! What...oh! Pardon me!${prompt}
  501: There's no gossip like good gossip!${prompt}
  502: But gossip you can't share with any-nutty-body... Where's the fun in that?${prompt}
  503: You mean the Shadow Lord been squishy-smashed? No way!${prompt}
  504: And you were there when it happened? No way! This is all, like, too much excitement for one day.${prompt}
  505: WISE and LOVELY head lady ZUBABA has reminded us that we must stay CALM in this time of despair.${prompt}
  506: (Well, that prune doesn't need to worry about me. As to what goes on within these walls, my mouth is shut as tight as a shall shell.)${prompt}
  507: Bringing back the dead, indeed! It is hard to believe that such heretic magic exists in our fair Vana'diel.${prompt}
  508: Though, that does remind me of that old legend of the magic doll...${prompt}
  509: Night in and night out, I had been having nothing but nasty nightmares. A coffin, shrouded in darkness, opens slowly and...AHHHHH!${prompt}
  510: But I did not have that dreadful dream last night. Does this mean the nightmare is over...or only just...AHHHHH!${prompt}
  511: I cannot begin to imagine what horrible things you reserved-preserved-observed up in those cursed Northlands.${prompt}
  512: But I no longer need to willy-wally-worry. You are at home now, and everyone welcomes you back. ${prompt}
  513: This morning, when the sun rose and the evening stars faded slowly, slowly...I saw the Star Sibyl gazing into the Star Spring.${prompt}
  514: |-
    “One great star has vanished...”
    She must have heard the tale of your wonderful, wonderful victory from the stars.${prompt}
  515: This is the Vestal Vestibule for the Star Sibyl's ladies-in-waiting. I guess you could call this the second floor of the Heavens Tower you are in. <Grin>${prompt}
  516: The ladies today have lost their usual composure, but do not look down upon them. Your news has everyone excited after feeling down for such a long while. <Smile>${prompt}
  517: U-um...I...um...${prompt}
  518: '...I just wanted to say...welcome back home!${prompt}'
  519: Now that you mention it, I haven't seen the Orastery minister around lately...${prompt}
  520: Before, he was here almost every day, flapping his gummy-gums off. I hardly got any bed-making done.${prompt}
  521: Kupipi's s～o happy to see you back, ${name-player}! The ladies from upstairs already told me about your adventures!${prompt}

  530: It makes Kupipi s～o sad to have to ask adventurers from other countries to do a task that should be done by Windurstians.${prompt}

    Regions under beastman control.${prompt}
  7500: All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt}
  7501: Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt}
  7502: Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt}
  7503: So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt}
  7504: |-
    Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.
    They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt}
  7505: Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt}
  7506: Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt}
  7507: |-
    So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.
    We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt}
  7508: |-
    You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.
    Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt}
  7509: |-
    Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.
    The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt}

    You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.
    Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt}

  7514: |-
    You also receive rank points for completing missions.
    Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt}

    You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.
    Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}
  7516: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt}
  7517: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt}
  7518: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt}
  7519: Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt}
  7520: Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt}
  7521: Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt}
  7522: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt}
  7523: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt}
  7524: |-
    Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.
    If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt}
  7525: If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt}
  7526: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt}
  7527: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt}
  7528: There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt}
  7529: |-
    Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.

    We scientists give-ethy a numerical rating to any problems brought before us.${prompt}
  7910: Ranking the problem helps give-ethy us an idea of how much brainy-wainy power is needed to solve it. This prevents us from wasting any of our time.${prompt}
  7911: Listen, you two. We underestimated this problem-ethy here before us. Let's re-rank-ethy and re-think-ethy our predicament.${prompt}
  7912: Ranking the problemeroo? That theory sounds awfully familiar-iffic...${prompt}
  7913: |-
    Awfully familiar? Well, of course it is! Don't be absurd.
    That is what our principal from the School of Magic would always say, word for word.${prompt}
  7914: Y-yes, well, let us examine-ethy this problem from the beginning. If nothing in the water, soil, or light has been changed, then we must focus-ethy on the moment that things began going wrong.${prompt}
  7915: There must-ethy be a logical cause for every effect. What we must-ethy determine is when the “effect” took-ethy place.${prompt}
  7916: I got-gottily-got it! That line was Karaha-Baruha's!${prompt}
  7917: |-
    Word for word!
    Why don't you try putting things in your words for a change? Don't you think all this plagiarism is a bit strange?${prompt}
  7918: <Sigh>${prompt}
  7919: Chumimi, approximately when did the star trees begin-ethy to wither-hither?${prompt}
  7920: Well, ever since the Great War twenty years ago, the trees have looked worse and worse with each coming day.${prompt}
  7921: |-
    Twenty years...
    A lot can happen-ethy in twenty years, you know. Do you two have any ideas?${prompt}
  7922: Hmm...diddly...doodly...${prompt}
  7923: (Twenty years ago, I was in Jeuno with a certain researchification organization set up to fight the hunger problemaroo that the Great War had thrust upon Vana'diel.)${prompt}
  7924: (It was then that I met Rasusu. Mighty cuterino, she was.)${prompt}
  7925: (We would always walk-dickery-dock together in the Ru'Lude Gardens...)
  7926: Doctor Koru-Moru, have you talked with any of the children in Jeuno?${prompt}
  7927: It seems as if the Rolanberry Fields that we worked so hard to protect have become infested with crawly-crawlers.${prompt}
  7928: If we don't do something quicky-wicky, the children will starve to death. To think of their innocent faces...${prompt}
  7929: (Researchers from all over Vana'diel put their happy heads together to solve the problemaroo. We came up with many diff-doffily-different ideas, but...)${prompt}
  7930: (...but the situation just got worse. We had to do-diddly-do something, or risk a possible disas-master-saster.)${prompt}
  7931: (That is when I suggested startilly-starting the cultivation of star trees for food.)${prompt}
  7932: It isn't possible, Doctor. The star tree is an important symbol of faith in Windurst. On top of that, the trees are only allowed to be grown in the confines of Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  7933: If a minister such as yourself were to illegally bring one to Jeuno... Think of the consequences!${prompt}
  7934: (Yes, starseeds are the sole proper-property of Heavens Tower, and yes, there was no way that a plan such as mine would be acceptified.)${prompt}
  7935: (But I couldn't standly-stand to see Rasusu so depressed.)${prompt}
  7936: (My young blood began to boileroo, and before you knew it, I had “borrowed” a bag of starseeds from Heavens Tower. All of this for my beloved Rasusu.)${prompt}
  7937: Doctor Koru-Moru, I am flattered by your gesture, but I beg of you, don't use these seeds yet. I couldn't handle it if anything was to happen to you because of me.${prompt}
  7938: Before you try your plan, please, give me one more chance. There is something I wish to try outaru.${prompt}
  7939: No, I cannot tell you. You just have to believe me. If my plan does not work, I will return and we can plant these seeds together.${prompt}
  7940: (Rasusu never returned...)${prompt}
  7941: (Before I could set out to look for her, I was called back to Windurst.)${prompt}
  7942: (However, a single day-doodily-do hasn't gone by when I haven't thought of her...)${prompt}
  7943: |-
    Ahem...diddly...
    Now that you mention it, I do remembereeno that Rasusu borrowed the seeds from me before she left!${prompt}
  7944: What is this you say-ethy, Professor? Do you have-ethy anything you'd like to share-ethy with us?${prompt}
  7945: I think-thankily-thunk I know what may be wrongified with the star trees! The trees may be angry-mangly at something I doodily-did twenty years...${prompt}
  7946: |-
    Ahem...diddly...
    Hey, you adventurer, lend me your ear.${prompt}
  7947: What is going on here?${prompt}
  7948: |-
    It looks as if our friend the professor does not want us to hear his dirty pastaru.
    I wouldn't advise sticking our noses in too deep, as something terrible happens every time. Remember the lastaru?${prompt}
  7949: You have-ethy a point...${prompt}
  7950: Diddly-did you get that, adventurer? This is strictly-prickly between you and me.${prompt}
  7951: Twenty years ago, a Tarutaru researcher named Rasusu was stationed in Jeuno.${prompt}
  7952: 'I would like you to find her and get-gettily back the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  7953: Then I want you to hurry-scurry back here and give the seeds to Chumimi. Tell her that you found them lying aroundaroo somewhere.${prompt}
  7954: |-
    Um, Professor, I can hear you.
    You asked our adventurer to find a Rasusu in Jeuno...${prompt}
  7955: If this Rasusu can solve our problems, I welcome any search parties.${prompt}
  7956: Welcome back, fine adventurer. So these are the seeds...${prompt}
  7957: By looking at the number on the bag, I can tell you that these are as old as an old Quadav. I'd have to check the records to make sure, but this appears to be a bag that was lost during the Great War.${prompt}
  7958: Many seeds were lost when Windurst Walls flooded twenty years ago.${prompt}
  7959: |-
    What-diddly-dut is this you say?
    Then the reason-aroony that the star trees are angry-mangly has nothing to do with me steali...has nothily-nothing to do with Rasusu?${prompt}
  7960: I commend-ethy you on your efforts. We got the details from Koru-Moru while you were away.${prompt}
  7961: |-
    Unbelievable, the things this crazy professor tries.
    I dragged him here so he could apologize.${prompt}
  7962: This is usually something that would not go unpunished, but Koru-Moru was young and in love... However, now we are back to the drawing board.${prompt}
  7963: Now let's put-ethy our heads together once more. Can either of you remember-ethy anything that might have caused the star trees to wither-hither?${prompt}
  7964: Hmmm...where was I twenty years ago...${prompt}
  7965: (Now that you mention it, twenty years ago I was in the Northlands leading a company of War Warlocks in battle with the Shadow Lord's minions.)${prompt}
  7966: '(I think it was Castle Zvahl. We were using ${item-plural: 1[2]} to communicate with headquarters, but we became stranded deep within that dark dominion.)${prompt}'
  7967: |-
    Minister Shantotto!
    According to the W.W. ${item-singular: 1[2]}, our company is the only one to become stuck and stranded! ${prompt}
  7968: Our brave backup forces have been amply ambushed by the enduring enemy. They are reporting many costly casualties!${prompt}

  7971: Of all the things that could go wrong, why do all of them have to go wrong at this instance?${prompt}
  7972: We could use my magic to warp out of the castle, but that would leave the red mages at the gateway helpless.${prompt}
  7973: We must conceive a way to work around the deadly dragon and deal it a blow from the back.${prompt}
  7974: The question is, how do we make it from this room to the gateway without coming under enemy attack?${prompt}
  7975: Ta-dah! The answer lies in this talking doll! Come on out, now. Tell us where to go.${prompt}
  7976: |-
    Nowhere to go! Ha!

  7995: |-
    What?
    Did you remember-ethy something?${prompt}
  7996: |-
    Ohoho! I apologize for my sudden outburst.
    I do remember one thing that may be the cause of our trouble here in Windurst.${prompt}
  7997: |-
    You, over there!
    I have a job for you.${prompt}
  7998: Well, that makes sensearooney! Shantotto was the causable-cause of our problem!${prompt}
  7999: That is what our adventurer here is going to find-ethy out for us.${prompt}
  8000: I'm assuming an adventurer of your stature is familiar with Castle Zvahl.${prompt}
  8001: Twenty years ago, I led a company into the castle to battle the Shadow Lord, and I sacrificed that talking doll to save us all.${prompt}
  8002: Now, the curse of that terrible doll may be what is affecting the star trees. I want you to find that doll and bring it back to Chumimi.${prompt}
  8003: |-
    Not to me, mind you.
    If I saw that piece of junk again, who knows what I would do...${prompt}
  8004: |-
    Anyway, you know what you have to do.
    Now, be off with you!${prompt}
  8005: I heard everything. Bringing back a talking something-or-other from Castle Zvahl, right?${prompt}
  8006: Oh, don't worry. I'll be as ready as a rarab for whatever you bring back.${prompt}
  8007: So this is what Doctor Shantotto thinks-ethy is causing all our problems...${prompt}
  8008: I cannot help-ethy but feel puzzy-wuzzled...${prompt}
  8009: Wait a minute! This is the “Foe Finder Mk. I” magic doll-dilldly-do that I made years ago!${prompt}
  8010: I lent it to you to scaneroo for monsters...and you never-ever returned it!${prompt}
  8011: |-
    Well, I had no doubt!
    This doll's magic has run out!${prompt}
  8012: |-
    With no magic, these things are useless.
    There is no way it could be cursing us.${prompt}
  8013: You mean to tell-ethy me, you thought a curse from this doll was affecting the star trees? How unscientific-ethy!${prompt}
  8014: However, we cannot take-ethy any chances. This doll may know-ethy something we don't.${prompt}
  8015: Really? This piece of junk?${prompt}
  8016: Good work, Miss Chumimi. Now you can leave-ethy the rest to me.${prompt}
  8017: Oh, and our adventurer. I commend-ethy you on your work as well. As a measure of our gratitude, please accept-ethy this.${prompt}
  8018: I wonder if I can really trust those three to find out what is going on?${prompt}
  8019: |-
    No, no!
    I must believe in their wisdom! If the Star Sibyl can, I can...right?${prompt}
  8020: Where could everybody...
  8021: Oh, you're here--and perfect timing, too. The doctors should be here any minute.${prompt}
  8022: Hi-doodly-ho, campereenos! Yours truly has fixed the magic doll!${prompt}
  8023: |-
    Can we get on with this quick?
    I have test subjects waiting, all poisoned and sick.
  8024: First, let me assure-ethy you that some crazy-wazy curse is definitely not the cause-ethy of the star trees' problem.${prompt}
  8025: And it is most certainly not anger pent-ethy up by the star trees for acts of stupidity-ethy taken by our colleague, Koru-Moru.${prompt}
  8026: I see...${prompt}
  8027: Coming to these conclusions, we have decided-ethy on putting forth all our effort into solving the problem.${prompt}
  8028: You mean you weren't putting forth all your effort before?${prompt}
  8029: Chumimi, Chumimi. The road one travels does-ethy not matter. What is important is the destination you reach-ethy.${prompt}
  8030: Yes, the dest-diddily-doodilly-ination.${prompt}
  8031: And the destination is?${prompt}
  8032: |-
    The Great Star Tree.
    The Great Star Tree is the mothereeno of the baby star trees. If they are sickly-sick, it's got to be her faulteroo.${prompt}
  8033: Our Chumimi still looks confused, Professor. Let-ethy me go into more detail.${prompt}
  8034: The baby star trees sprout-ethy from starseeds taken from the Great Star Tree. We feel-ethy that the lack of magical energy-ethy in the Great Star Tree is causing problems in these seeds.${prompt}
  8035: On the outside, the Great Star Tree looks as it has for the past-ethy few centuries, but reports from our researchers tell-ethy us that it has begun to slowly rotaru from the inside.${prompt}
  8036: Up until now, we have left-ethy this grave problem in the hands of our younger colleagues. However, now it is time-ethy that we professors take-ethy control.${prompt}
  8037: You mean to tell me that you knew what was wrong, all along...?${prompt}
  8038: |-
    Ahem!
    The road to truth-ethy is often a windy-mindy one, is it not, Chumimi?${prompt}
  8039: <Sigh>${prompt}
  8040: The Rhinostery-ethy has worked in cooperation with Heavens Tower to conduct-ethy various research on the Great Star Tree. However, there has been only so much they could do.${prompt}
  8041: As the next phase of our plan, we would like to travel-ethy deep beneath the Great Star Tree and see if we can get to the roots of this problem, so to speak-ethy.${prompt}
  8042: That would mean going into the Toraimarai Canal. That place has been closed off since the Great War...${prompt}
  8043: Exactly, dear Chumimi. That is why we need you to get access for us from the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  8044: We have decided to send down this adventurer to end all this quibble.${prompt}
  8045: Alright, I will do as you ask. However, it will take time to get access.${prompt}
  8046: By the way-diddly-day, what makes you thinkeroo that this adventurer will know what to doodily-do when he gets down there?${prompt}
  8047: |-
    Hmmm, you have-ethy a point.
    Doctor Shantotto, we couldn't get you to go down there with our adventurer, could-ethy we?${prompt}
  8048: Ohoho! As much as I'd love to attend the show, I have other places I need to go.${prompt}
  8049: You don't mean-ethy Karaha-Baruha's laboratory, do you? I wouldn't advise-ethy on mixing business and pleasure at a time like this.${prompt}
  8050: Say what you will, Professor. If Karaha-Baruha hadn't gone and died before returning my equipment, I wouldn't have to go there and retrieve my property.${prompt}
  8051: Think of it as me doing him a favor. You wouldn't think that he'd want to spend eternity being hated by yours truly.${prompt}
  8052: If you think that I'm going to take-ethy any more part in these games you're playing...${prompt}
  8053: |-
    I've dot-spottily-got it!
    ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] can take one of my magic dolls! I can rebuilderoo “Foe Finder Mk. I”!${prompt}
  8054: Oh!${prompt}
  8055: |-
    Professor, that idea is wonderful.
    I can see someone here is being useful.${prompt}
  8056: Doodily!${prompt}
  8057: Um, but there's just one daddily-thing. I'm short on supplies to rebuilderoo it.${prompt}
  8058: 'Ah, ${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Miss] Adventurer, could you bringereeno ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to my manor?${prompt}'
  8059: Oh, and don't bother bring-dingily-dinging it here. There's nothing Chumimi can doodily-do with it.${prompt}
  8060: Finally something is happily-happening! And once your access to the Toraimarai Canal has been granted, we may get some answers at last!${prompt}
  8061: 'But we''ll need that magic doll first. Professor Koru-Moru needs you to bring ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to him at his major manor.${prompt}'
  8062: Oops! You're supposed to take this directly to Professor Koru-Moru.${prompt}
  8063: ${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Miss] Adventurer! Your access to the Toraimarai Canal has been granted!${prompt}
  8064: If it isn't too much trouble, could you call the three professors here?${prompt}
  8065: That won't be necessareeno.${prompt}
  8066: We are all ready to go, go, go.${prompt}
  8067: Here you are, adventureeno! My masterpiece, the “Sluice Surveyor Mk. I”!${prompt}
  8068: Wonderful, Professor. At times you surprise-ethy us.${prompt}
  8069: Improved features, MP efficient, and silent running (at the request of Dr. Shantotto).${prompt}
  8070: Silent running! Now that is a feature that they should put on all magic dolls! Ohohoho!${prompt}
  8071: Take this doll-doodily-doll down to the Toraimarai Canal. She'll begin to function when she senses something fishy-washy.${prompt}
  8072: Travel to the Toraimarai Canal and find out what is wrong with the Great Star Tree. You can get there through the central tower in the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt}
  8073: |-
    <Sigh>
    It was a long and windy-grindy road, but I think we are almost at the end.${prompt}
  8074: Hmmm...I see. Magic stagnation in the Toraimarai Canal... It does make-ethy sense.${prompt}
  8075: It has been-ethy years since the magic towers in Sarutabaruta have operated. This must-ethy be what is affecting the flow of magic in the canal.${prompt}
  8076: However, if our adventurer has succeeded in cleaning up-ethy some of this stagnation, then things should get-ethy better-batter for the time being.${prompt}
  8077: Yes, Professor! Just knowing what is wrong can get us pointed in the right direction.${prompt}
  8078: However, now we will have-ethy to arrange a regular cleaning of this stagnation to prevent-ethy our problem from getting any worse.${prompt}
  8079: But whatilly-what about what my “Sluice Surveyor Mk. I” said down-diddly-down there? She's sensing something on beyond the Gate of Earth.${prompt}
  8080: That small room in the central tower has gone unused for ages. What couldily-could it meaneroo?${prompt}
  8081: My “Sluice Surveyor Mk. I” says she sensed some strangeriffic magic forcereeno beyond the Gate of Earth.${prompt}
  8082: That small room in the central tower has gone unused for ages. What couldily-could it meaneroo?${prompt}
  8083: Yes, yes, it could mean-ethy anything...but where is Doctor Shantotto? She didn't go to...${prompt}
  8084: I'm here, I'm here.${prompt}
  8085: Doctor! You didn't travel-ethy to Karaha-Baruha's laboratory, did you?${prompt}
  8086: And after I warned you not to...${prompt}
  8087: Quiet, Professor! It was terrible down there. You don't have a clue. Just look at my hat! It's all moldy-woldy and covered with mildew!${prompt}
  8088: |-
    ...
    That is just-ethy terrible...
  8089: |-
    It's a good hat, but you should probably wash it first.
    Take good care of it, unless you want to get cursed.${prompt}
  8090: 'I''m still worried aboutaru what''s going on beyon-didily-ond the Gate of Earth. Go to Kupipi and receive ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}. Use that to investigateroo what is doodly-down there.${prompt}'
  8091: Thank you so much for your help. The three professors are as grateful as a giant goobbue.${prompt}
  8092: Oh, the Gate of Earth? Well, the central tower is under the jurisdiction of Heaven Tower, so I'm sure the cleric Kupipi will grant you permission to travel down there rightaru away.${prompt}
  8093: Wha～t? Can't you see I'm busy-wusy? If you don't have any business with Kupipi, off with you.${prompt}
  8094: '${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 1[2]}? We～ll, it just happens that I have the last one right here. Don''t worry! You''re the first in line.${prompt}'

  8096: |-
    Wh-what?
    You found new buds?${prompt}
  8097: This is good...no, terrible. If the Great Star Tree is trying to regenerate, then that means its current condition is...${prompt}
  8098: This has to be looked into further. Until we know for certain what is happening, I'd like you to keep this a secretaru.${prompt}
  8099: Stagnation in the canal? Unbelievataru!${prompt}
  8100: Whataru? You cleaned it all up? That's a relief!${prompt}
  8101: The Toraimarai Canal in the central tower was made off-limits, off-limits to all, after the Great War.${prompt}
  8102: That's why the stagnation had gone unnoticed for so long. Oh, the poor, poor star trees!${prompt}
  8103: |-
    My star tree has a first name, it's S★T★A★R♪
    My star tree has a second name, it's T★R★E★E♪${prompt}
  8104: Thanks to my tireless singing, the star trees are on the road to lovely-recovery! Maybe I should sing louder...${prompt}
  8105: Before, one could go right straight forward directly into the Toraimarai Canal via the Priming Gate located in Windurst Walls.${prompt}
  8106: However, that gate was sealed long ago, and now the only way into the canal is through the central tower of the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt}
  8107: |-
    What? Our fault, it wasn't? Wonderful-ful!
    ...
    Whose fault was it?${prompt}
  8108: The way those three professors went on and on and on and on...I thought our problem would never be solved.${prompt}
  8109: If they'd only spend more time thinking and less time ranting and raving and bickering, we would've been out of our pickle-wickle a lot sooner, though.${prompt}
  8110: This is just between you and me, but has Kupipi over there ever pressured you into bringing back gifts and goodies from your missions?${prompt}
  8111: 'Every time anybody travels to Jeuno, she always has them bring back a load of ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  8112: What? For me? Even though I didn't... You shouldn't have!${prompt}
  8113: I'm so...so...so...${prompt}
  8114: W-wait right here. I have a little something for you.${prompt}
  8115: With this, you can open the Sealed Portal in the Horutoto Ruins by yourself.${prompt}
  8116: Don't worry, I even got that o～ld battle axe Zubaba's permission. I told her that with this key, our brave adventurer could clean the central tower at any time!${prompt}
  8117: Keep up the good work for Windurst! And if you're ever in Jeuno...${prompt}
  8118: I'll ne～ver forget your act of kindness! If you are ever near Heavens Tower, be sure to stop by and visit Kupipi! Maybe I'll even have a present for you!${prompt}
  8119: 'You are the kind adventurer that brought me the ${item-singular: 1[2]}!${prompt}'
  8120: I'll ne～ver forget your act of kindness! If you are ever near Heavens Tower, be sure to stop by and visit Kupipi! Maybe I'll even have a present for you!${prompt}
  8121: Now that the Shadow Lord, King of the beastmen, has been defeated, it is time for the people of Vana'diel to rrrise again. To keep ahead of other nations, we must first stabilize our own country...${prompt}
  8122: Leave the prrroblems of Windurst in the hands of the Sibyl Guards. You need to be keeping an eye on the progress of our rrrival countries. It is not unthinkable that certain elements could be plotting against us.${prompt}
  8123: If you ever grow tirrred of the adventuring life, we could use someone with your untapped potential.${prompt}
  8124: Windurst must be prepared for the days of strrrife ahead.${prompt}
  8125: The Shadow Lord has been dealt with, but Semih Lafihna is still as fired up as usual.${prompt}
  8126: Today, she went out looking for that disrrruptive little Orastery minister.${prompt}
  8127: The objectives of the missions given out at gatehouses are not prrroperly scrutinized. It seems the ministers are having adventurers participate in all sorts of harebrrrained schemes.${prompt}
  8128: Brrringing the ministers back into line will be the first step in changing Windurst for the better.${prompt}
  8129: After the defeat of the Shadow Lord, I thought there would be a change in attitude from the Yagudo. However, Castle Oztroja continues to maintain its silence.${prompt}
  8130: This silence is verrry unsettling. I wonder if they still have another card left to play?${prompt}
  8131: The strongest of the Sibyl Guards is, without a doubt, Semih Lafihna. She has the ability to read the flow of things.${prompt}
  8132: |-
    The flow of water, the flow of wind, the flow of light.
    When the flow comes into focus, time stands still for a moment.${prompt}
  8133: You have performed ma～ny great deeds, but you have not been alone in accomplishing them.${prompt}
  8134: If you forget this fact, and forget those who helped you get where you are, things will turn to sour grapes on you. You must a～lways remember to be grateful.${prompt}
  8135: |-
    So, have you finished all your tasks?
    Things have finally settled down around here, too. Now we need to shore up our reserves for the next trial that comes along.${prompt}
  8136: |-
    ...You good-for-nothing layabout!
    If you have time to dawdle-wawdle around here, you should be off completing missions for your country!${prompt}
  8137: |-
    So, have you finished all your tasks?

  8138: |-
    ...You good-for-nothing layabout!
    If you have time to dawdle-wawdle around here, you should be off completing missions for your country!${prompt}
  8139: Your next journey will be safey-wafey and profitable, I believe.${prompt}
  8140: Oh, please don't misunderstand me. I really-weally don't trust you at all. I'm well aware that adventurer types are not worthy of an honest person's trust.${prompt}
  8141: |-
    I can't believe what's happened!
    Just when I thoughtaru I would never see the day, Semih Lafihna caughty-wort the Orastery minister and sent him on his way to the Dark Dungeon!${prompt}
  8142: "...And I'm still here making beds every day. \n...My life is so boring-woring.${prompt}"
  8143: I, I heard from my daddy-pappy that the Dor--Dark Dungeon is a really s-scary place.${prompt}
  8144: There are a lot of fruiten--frightening stories about that place, and a l-l-lot of them are supposed to be true. G-G-Goddess!${prompt}
  8145: To get to the Star Sibyl's chambers, you must pass throu～gh the Planetarium and enter through the door wa～y in the back.${prompt}
  8146: |-
    ...... <sniff>
    I just can't hold back a～ll the tears. <sob>${prompt}
  8147: I am quite certain you are already aware of the situation at hand, but...${prompt}
  8148: What on Vana'diel were you thinking!? I distinctly told you to be wary of that slimy-wimy little Ajido-Marujido!${prompt}
  8149: Proceed to the door in the back.${prompt}
  8150: Watch yourself in therrre, or you will have Lady Semih Lafihna to answerrr to!${prompt}
  8151: "That insolent Orastery minister has finally been put away. \nNow we might get some peace around here.${prompt}"
  8152: Opening the Darrrk Dungeon requires a “Charm of Darkness.” However, only the Star Sibyl is capable of making them.${prompt}
  8153: |-
    This spells the end for the Orastery ministerrr...
    It's such a shame...${prompt}
  8154: Do you remember the bearer of darkness that appearrred here?${prompt}
  8155: Someone came here claiming to have seen it in another country. What on Vana'diel is that thing?${prompt}
  8156: The Shadow Lord has fallen, but the beastmen are still stirring.${prompt}
  8157: They will embrace a new leader and turn their predatory gaze towards us once more. We must keep our skills sharp for the next uprising.${prompt}
  8158: The Yagudo of Castle Oztroja are known to stage death matches for the pleasurrre of their king. They are nothing but bloodthirsty fiends.${prompt}
  8159: The Star Sibyl believes we should have amicable relations with these animals... What do you think?${prompt}
  8160: I thought that maybe I could trust an adventurer like yourself, but...I still have some reservations.${prompt}
  8161: '...Apururu, you should know this as well as I do.${prompt}'
  8162: Summoning is extraordinarily dangerous. We were not meant to experiment with such powers.${prompt}
  8163: The Orastery minister has tampered with the Horutoto Ruins without permission...I can no longer overlook his indiscretions.${prompt}
  8164: |-
    But, Star Sibyl!
    Windurst was saved from devastation twenty years ago when Karaha-Baruha used that very same summoning magic!${prompt}
  8165: Of course, I understand that summoning is not to be taken lightly! But if my deary-weary brother is able to master that magic as he believes he can...${prompt}
  8166: Excessive force gives birth to conflict and causes more problems than it solves.${prompt}
  8167: '...That kind of overwhelming power invites dreams of ambition that will lead to the destruction of our country. ${prompt}'
  8168: |-
    And for that reason, you condemn Ajido-Marujido to a life of imprisonment?
    My dear brother may be a silly-billy, spacey-wacey, noodle-head, but he's the only brother I have!${prompt}
  8169: |-
    ${name-player}...
    You have come...
  8170: I was informed by the Sibyl Guards that you were with Ajido-Marujido at the time of his arrest.${prompt}
  8171: |-
    Do you share his opinion?
    Do you believe that Windurst should join the battle against the beastmen?${prompt}
  8172: |-
    Is that what you believe?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  8173: |-
    I see. Perhaps that is as it should be.
    ...However, the Windurst of today does not have the might to war with the beastmen as it did twenty years ago.${prompt}
  8174: |-
    No, do not try to hide it.
    Your eyes burn with the flames of a warrior's spirit.
    ...However, the Windurst of today does not have the might to war with the beastmen as it did twenty years ago.${prompt}
  8175: But I did not call you here to speak of war. You are here to atone for the crimes you have committed.${prompt}
  8176: Do not be concerned. With the great services you have performed for our nation, you will escape the fate that has befallen Ajido-Marujido.${prompt}
  8177: |-
    However, your transgression at the behest of the Orastery minister is more serious than you think...
    I cannot simply let this matter drop.${prompt}
  8178: '...And so I have decided for you to accept the invitation that arrived a few days ago from the Yagudo Holy One residing in Castle Oztroja.${prompt}'
  8179: This is an invitation to participate in the contest held at Balga's Dais in Giddeus. It is a tournament that pits the warriors of Windurst against the champions of the Yagudo in order to reinforce our bond of mutual trust.${prompt}
  8180: If you do not prevail against their champions in the contest, however, Windurst must increase her offerings to the Yagudo.${prompt}
  8181: You may have as many as six people participate in the tournament, as long as you all meet the requirements. Find those who have had experience fighting in the contest and enlist their assistance.${prompt}
  8182: |-
    ......
    ${name-player}... I realize you must have little affection for me now, but let me say one thing.${prompt}
  8183: '...Come back to us safely...${prompt}'
  8184: |-
    ...... <sniff>
    I just can't hold back the tears. <sob>${prompt}
  8185: |-
    I don't know how to say this any other way.
    ...Plea～se come back to us alive.${prompt}
  8186: |-
    ...!
    You're ba～ck!${prompt}
  8187: |-
    Thank the Goddess you're safe.
    I had heard that even if you win at Balga's Dais, the Yagudo of Oztroja sti～ll treat you as an intruder-wuder.${prompt}
  8188: |-
    The Yagudo just don't play fair...
    But there's not a lot that we can do about it...${prompt}
  8189: ${name-player}, you have returned. The Yagudo Holy One appears to be satisfied with the outcome of the contest.${prompt}
  8190: I now declare your crimes to be forgiven, and grant you your freedom.${prompt}
  8191: But this does not give you leave to speak of what you witnessed at the Full Moon Fountain. I ask you to keep these things locked tight within your heart.${prompt}
  8192: |-
    ${name-player}...
    If you are a loyal citizen of Windurst, please...
    Do not betray my trust.${prompt}
  8193: |-
    You are the cha～mpion of Windurst!
    I thought the punishment handed down by the Star Sibyl would be the end of you!${prompt}
  8194: But now that you have overcome this little-bitty-witty stumbling block, you have increased your standing to rank seven!${prompt}
  8195: |-
    You have had many hardships to overcome...
    What drives you to meet and defeat a～ll of these challenges?${prompt}
  8196: '...You don''t have to answer that question. Just know that we appreciate ev～erything you have done for us.${prompt}'
  8197: |-
    What is it, what is it?
    You seem a～ll worked up about something.${prompt}
  8198: |-
    I don't respond to veiled threats.
    If you have something you want to ask me, just come out and say it.${prompt}
  8199: '...A～bsolutely not.${prompt}'
  8200: |-
    The ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} is extre～mely valuable and can't just be handed over to any old adventurer on demand.
    Tell me exa～ctly what you want to use it for.${prompt}
  8201: |-
    Why do you want the ring?
    ${selection-lines}
    For a jai～lbreak!
    As a favor for Minister Apu～ruru.
    As a favor for the O～rastery.${prompt}
  8202: |-
    !!!
    A～bsolutely out of the question!!!${prompt}
  8203: |-
    For Minister Apururu...?
    There's something deci～dedly suspicious going on here.${prompt}
  8204: You can tell the members of the Orastery that one of them can bring proof of his identity and come to Heavens Tower himself.${prompt}
  8205: '...But maybe I''ve been a li～ttle hasty. You and I have known each other for a while now, and I assume you have a goo～d reason for wanting the ring.${prompt}'
  8206: 'So I''ll give you a li～ttle hint. The ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} is being carried by Semih Lafihna.${prompt}'
  8207: At the moment, she's off at the northwest tower of the Horutoto Ruins, dealing with the roguey-woguey Cardians.${prompt}
  8208: '...She''s been gone such a lo～ng time, though, and I''m starting to worry.${prompt}'
  8209: 'The ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} is being carried by Semih Lafihna. She was last headed for the northwest tower of the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt}'
  8210: The roguey-woguey Cardians are up to something. I overheard the children at the port saying Semih Lafihna had gone off by herself to assess the situation.${prompt}
  8211: |-
    Hmph!
    Something's not right here. Why do I get the feely-wheeling you're hiding something from me...?${prompt}
  8212: The Star Sibyl and Semi Lafihna have that sa～me aura around them, and it's cast a da～rk pall over Heavens Tower. It troubles me greatly.${prompt}
  8213: |-
    You want to know how to make the charm that opens the Dark Dungeon...?
    Whatever do you hope to gain by asking me such a ridiculous question?${prompt}
  8214: I will never betray the Star Sibyl! While I still have breath in my body, I will stand against anyone who tries to do so!${prompt}
  8215: 'Don''t come any closer...!${wait-animation: 2}'
  8216: 'The Diza Star...${wait-animation: 2}'
  8217: Star Sibyl!
  8218: 'Ungh!${wait-animation: 2}'
  8219: Little fiend!
  8220: Stop right there!
  8221: I... I don't...!?
  8222: '...Sta...'
  8223: Star Sibyl!
  8224: Star Sibyl!
  8225: I must apologize, Star Sibyl. We have failed in our duty to keep intruders from your chambers...${prompt}
  8226: I will pursue the creature at once. The rest of the Sibyl Guards will be placed under Ajido-Marujido's command.${prompt}
  8227: Wait! You'll be wasting your time. Nobody can stop that thing.${prompt}
  8228: What are you saying? You have knowledge of this fiend!?${prompt}
  8229: Star Sibyl, the magic the creature was using was no ordinary spellcraft. That power was of the Stars and the Moon. The same power that pulses through the Horutoto Ruins and fills the Mana Orbs...${prompt}
  8230: It was the magic of Fenrir, the Great Beast that resided in the Full Moon Fountain. You felt it, didn't you?${prompt}
  8231: Idiocy! The Great Beast is no longer--${prompt}
  8232: No longer what? Fenrir has left the Full Moon Fountain.${prompt}
  8233: Star Sibyl, I have read the Book of the Gods. I know all aboutaru the beginning of Windurst and the deeds of the first Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  8234: You mustaru tell us. What happened at the Full Moon Fountain twenty years ago?${prompt}
  8235: '...You''re right, of course. The time has come for me to tell the tale.${prompt}'
  8236: It all started long ago, when the Star Sibyl performed the first Moon Reading at the Full Moon Fountain...${prompt}
  8237: That prophecy spanned events from several hundred years ago up until the time of the Great War.${prompt}
  8238: The prophecy gleaned from the Moon Reading was infused into the Star Spring within this very tower.${prompt}
  8239: We Star Sibyls have used that prophecy in conjunction with our Star Readings to guide the people of Windurst.${prompt}
  8240: '...The first Star Sibyl''s prophecy brought tidings of wealth and prosperity for our fair country. However, when I performed the Star Reading, I saw something entirely different...${prompt}'
  8241: I saw “destruction.”${prompt}
  8242: Complete and utter ruin... Windurst would be consumed in flames and swallowed by floods. Light would sear the sky, and our people would fall by the thousands...${prompt}
  8243: I went to seek the counsel of the Great Beast of the Full Moon Fountain... The Great Beast, Fenrir.${prompt}
  8244: You wish to save your people from destruction? Poor, frail little Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  8245: You hope in vain. The will of the Stars and the Moon is the design of the heavens. As the first Star Sibyl accepted the fate of destruction, so would the people come to welcome it, though it filled them with terror.${prompt}
  8246: Even that Star Sibyl yielded to her fear in her dealings with me. And you do nothing but cower in my presence--what could you possibly do?${prompt}
  8247: His words rang true. I could do nothing but tremble in the face of my fear.${prompt}
  8248: |-
    But I was not alone... I had a powerful ally by my side--
    Karaha-Baruha.${prompt}
  8249: Karaha-Baruha developed a new kind of magic to control the mind of the Great Beast, and change the will of the Stars and the Moon... He called this magic “Summoning.”${prompt}
  8250: However...
  8251: |-
    Enough...
    Enough, Karaha-Baruha!${prompt}
  8252: |-
    There is a limit to what even you can do!
    Your mind will be shattered...!${prompt}
  8253: I see you have the will to defy your fate...${prompt}
  8254: Star Sibyl, there is no reason to cower. There is nothing to fear.${prompt}
  8255: The time is near when darkness will obscure the light that guides you. But your steps must not falter. A path still exists through that blackest of nights.
  8256: '...And so the Great Beast, Fenrir, passed from our world...${prompt}'
  8257: |-
    Yes, that is the sad truth...
    The spirit of the Great Beast was vast... No matter how strong Karaha-Baruha was, it was impossible for him to fully contain Fenrir's power.${prompt}
  8258: Windurst lost the protection of the Stars and the Moon. The Horutoto Ruins could no longer function, the magical waters dried up, and the Star Tree began to wither...${prompt}
  8259: But as the Star Sibyl, I was still responsible for the guidance of our people. I still had to show them the way, even though the light no longer existed.${prompt}
  8260: |-
    Twenty years have passed...
    I have led our people with a string of false Star Readings. Nothing can be seen in the Star Spring. There is no future to be read there...${prompt}
  8261: '...${prompt}'
  8262: '...But, Star Sibyl--the future lives on. As Fenrir told you, the path still lies before us...${prompt}'
  8263: Neither peace nor destruction is certain. We mustaru seize the light with our own hands...!${prompt}
  8264: '...!${prompt}'
  8265: Star Sibyl, I ask you for permission to enter the Animastery of Karaha-Baruha.${prompt}
  8266: He and I are of the same mind. All I wantaru is to save Windurst. I need the knowledge that Karaha-Baruha uncovered...${prompt}
  8267: '...Ajido-Marujido...${prompt}'
  8268: You have my permission. I grant you leave to use all that remains of Karaha-Baruha's research, and pardon you for the crimes you have committed.${prompt}
  8269: |-
    Star Sibyl...
    Are you sure of this!?${prompt}
  8270: All that was to remain secret has been revealed here today. And yet Ajido-Marujido proposes we strive onward.${prompt}
  8271: And there is still the mystery of this dark visitor... We must discover its true nature.${prompt}
  8272: |-
    ...
    Your will is mine, Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  8273: Rightaru, it's time for me to get to work. If you need me, I'll be in the Animastery.${prompt}
  8274: Let Apururu know what has transpired here. Don'taru let me down, adventurer.${prompt}
  8275: Ah, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  8276: The bearer of darkness... There was not a single thing we could do to stop it! That horrid-worrid creature resisted every charm we could conceive!${prompt}
  8277: Many years have I spent in fair Windurst, but never have I encountered such an ominous being. I thank the Goddess the Star Sibyl was unharmed...${prompt}
  8278: What in the Star Sibyl's name is going on? Why has that frightening creature returned to Heavens Tower!?${prompt}
  8279: We ladies-in-waiting could not even bear to be near it. It seemed its very breath would be enough to freezy-weeze your soul.${prompt}
  8280: '...I c-c-can''taru s-s-stop sh-sh-shaking...${prompt}'
  8281: What is it about that b-b-bearer of d-d-darkness that c-c-causes such f-f-fear...? It was like b-b-being wrappy-wapped in p-p-pure blackness...${prompt}
  8282: I didn't even catch a glimpse of the bearer of darkness. And for that I'm profoundly-woundly grateful.${prompt}
  8283: I thought my heart would pitter-patter to a stop when I heard the Star Sibyl had been attacked. Thank the Goddess she's safe.${prompt}
  8284: This is, like, totally terrible! That evil-weevil bearer of darkness has shown up in the Planetarium again!${prompt}
  8285: The bearer of darkness is, like, not like any of the other beastmen! I heard it's, like, way weirder than anything anyone has ever seen!${prompt}
  8286: Lady ZUBABA and Sibyl Guard SEMIH LAFIHNA were so BRAVE in protecting the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  8287: (...Sigh... I wish I could be a teensy-weensy little bit more helpful. All I could do was sit here and pray for the best...)${prompt}
  8288: C-calm down, everyone!!! We can't protectaru the Star Sibyl when we're all falling to pieces like this!${prompt}
  8289: Are we going to do nothing but tremble-wemble in the corner the next time something like this happens? Adventurer, help Heruru bolster everyone's spirits!${prompt}
  8290: I wonder how the sinuously sly Sibyl Guards fared in the battle?${prompt}
  8291: We ladies-in-waiting are not being allowed into the Planetarium. So if you, my admirably acquainted adventurer, could ask for us, we would be most appreciative.${prompt}
  8292: The Star Spring is more than just a simple fountain. It is bubbly-bobbly-brimming with the power of the Stars and the Moon.${prompt}
  8293: Could it be that its strange magic wacky-wicky-worked like a magnet to draw in that creepy creature...? But nothing like that has ever hippy-hoppy-happened before...${prompt}
  8294: You've seen that bearer of darkness before!?${prompt}
  8295: And yet you came to confront it! How incredibly, incredibly brave of you!${prompt}
  8296: '...M-m-my hands, l-l-look at them qu-qu-quiver... <Shiver>${prompt}'
  8297: '...Oh, S-S-Star S-S-Sibyl... Will W-W-Windurst become the scene for a b-b-bloody b-b-beastman b-b-binge...? <Cringe>${prompt}'
  8298: Ah, um, did Mix--Minister Ajido-Marujido and the Soup--Sibyl Guard Semih Lafihna really chase off the b-bearer of d-darkness!?${prompt}
  8299: W-wow! They're so c-cool! I'm all aflutter!${prompt}
  8300: So many terrible-werrible things have been happening lately...${prompt}
  8301: It makes my skin crawl, but then again, I'm just a simple bedmaker. What does a well-traveled adventurer think of all this?${prompt}
  8302: Oh, you're far too la～te!${prompt}
  8303: Minister Ajido-Marujido and Semih Lafihna have a～lready gotten rid of the evil creature. There's no need for you to go u～p there.${prompt}
  8304: I, I feel so useless...${prompt}
  8305: Our best attacks merely rrrebounded off that thing. So this is what it feels like to be completely outmatched...${prompt}
  8306: Semih Lafihna and the Orastery minister forrrced open the door to the Star Sibyl's chambers.${prompt}
  8307: The bearer of darrrkness disappeared after seeing those two burrrst in, but... This may not be the last we'll see of it...${prompt}
  8308: We were faced with such incredible powerrr... Even we Sibyl Guards were frozen to the spot by the terrrror that creature inspired.${prompt}
  8309: In coming to Heavens Tower, was its goal to seek out the Star Sibyl?${prompt}
  8310: I rrrecognized the stench that the bearer of darkness exuded...${prompt}
  8311: |-
    It was the smell of the dead...
    That putrid miasma has no place in this world.${prompt}
  8312: If you're looking for Semih Lafihna and the Orastery minister, they're in the Star Sibyl's chamberrrs.${prompt}
  8313: As you have been summoned here, I will grant you permission to pass through the door to the Vestal Chambers. An adventurer like yourself who travels the width and breadth of Vana'diel may find some way to triumph against the bearer of darkness.${prompt}
  8314: |-
    ...
    Those soulless eyes. A chill runs down my spine just thinking about it.${prompt}
  8315: We Sibyl Guard were terror-stricken--but those delicate little Tarutaru must've been scared out of their wits!${prompt}
  8316: With the stress she's been through, the Star Sibyl will be taking a break from her duties for a while.${prompt}
  8317: Rescuing the Star Sibyl will be best accomplished by a small, well-coordinated team.${prompt}
  8318: The Cardians might decide to use the Star Sibyl as a shield, though. Those puppets probably have no idea of how much a person's life is worth.${prompt}
  8319: We underrrestimated those dolls, and now we're paying the prrrice for it.${prompt}
  8320: We have no choice but to go to the Manustery for help. But with the minister being Ajido-Marujido's sister, I wonder how much we can trrrust her.${prompt}
  8321: We Sibyl Guards were formed to protect the perrrson of the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  8322: But if we can't perform our duties as bodyguards, our prrresence here outside the Vestal Chamber becomes no more than a charrrade.${prompt}
  8323: '...This must be something like the frustrrration the Star Sibyl felt when performing those meaningless ceremonies at the magic-drained Star Spring.${prompt}'
  8324: For some reason or another, that Joker Cardian and the bearer of darkness seem to share the same kind of aura.${prompt}
  8325: I can't really explain it very well, but I think Semih Lafihna underrrstands what I mean.${prompt}
  8326: When the Star Sibyl announced she wanted to head down to the Full Moon Fountain, Semih Lafihna objected, saying it was too dangerous.${prompt}
  8327: However, the Star Sibyl insisted therrre was something she needed to make sure of. This is my personal opinion, but I think the Star Sibyl may have had some idea of the dark intruderrr's true nature.${prompt}
  8328: '......${prompt}'
  8329: '...${name-player}.${prompt}'
  8330: You've received the mission briefing?${prompt}
  8331: The situation has become volatile. The Yagudo are screaming that Windurst has broken one of the clauses of the peace treaty.${prompt}
  8332: There is a passage in the treaty that states the central magic tower in West Sarutabaruta shall not be reactivated without the prior agreement of both parties.${prompt}
  8333: Apparently it did not escape the beady eyes of the Yagudo when Ajido-Marujido awoke the tower using the Mana Orbs.${prompt}
  8334: Now they're demanding we give them control of the Horutoto Ruins to make amends for our break in faith.${prompt}
  8335: It's obvious those feathered devils want to establish a base rrright under Windurst's nose, but it'll be a cold day in Kazham before I ever let something like that happen...${prompt}
  8336: |-
    ......
    In any event, the rescue of the Star Sibyl comes first and foremost. Let us go and meet with Ajido-Marujido.${prompt}
  8337: '...${prompt}'
  8338: Semih Lafihna...${prompt}
  8339: |-
    Apururu!?
    If you're here, then you must have...${prompt}
  8340: |-
    ...Yes.
    I heard from my dear brother...of the fate that has befallen the Star Sibyl...${prompt}
  8341: The Manustery is responsible for all of this! I mustaru apologize to you, Semih Lafihna... To the Star Sibyl... To everyone...${prompt}
  8342: Raise your head, Apururu. This is not your fault.${prompt}
  8343: I was the one who took the Star Sibyl down to the Full Moon Fountain while unknown terrors stalked the shadows. I accept full responsibility.${prompt}
  8344: Semih Lafihna...${prompt}
  8345: That “terror” is not unknown to us.${prompt}
  8346: The bearer of darkness is mostaru likely the resurrected Karaha-Baruha.${prompt}
  8347: What are you saying!?${prompt}
  8348: '...The research left here was extremely thorough. A perfectaru theory that surpassed all other systems of magic to stand at the pinnacle of achievement.${prompt}'
  8349: Karaha-Baruha succeeded in his “complete summoning” and dominatarued the will of the Great Beast, Fenrir.${prompt}
  8350: However, that spirit was too vast for any one person's body to contain, the energy too intense. Fenrir was dragged into the abyss of death along with Karaha-Baruha.${prompt}
  8351: |-
    And now the deceased have returned...
    The “bearer of darkness” is an incarnation that contains the spirit of both Karaha-Baruha, and the Great Beast.${prompt}
  8352: A shared existence...${prompt}
  8353: And that is why Joker has taken control of the Full Moon Fountain. But why hold the Star Sibyl captive?${prompt}
  8354: For revenge!?${prompt}
  8355: If, as you say, part of the bearer of darkness is the Great Beast, it must blame the Star Sibyl for its death.${prompt}
  8356: Was its hate for the Star Sibyl what brought it to Heavens Tower...?${prompt}
  8357: Of that, we can'taru be certain. When Joker's wish is fulfilled and the bearer of darkness returns to the Full Moon Fountain, there is no telling what will happen.${prompt}
  8358: However, to keep the Star Sibyl from harm, we mustaru do as Joker requests.${prompt}
  8359: But how?${prompt}
  8360: There is no way we can force the bearer of darkness to return to the fountain. It comes and goes in the blink of an eye, and our attacks are completely ineffective against it.${prompt}
  8361: Leave that to me. There is one method of luring the part that is Fenrir back to the Full Moon Fountain.${prompt}
  8362: This method entails using the song of the ancient Kuluu that is mentioned in the Book of the Gods. The Kuluu had apparentaruly forged a pact with the avatars.${prompt}
  8363: The three verses of the song are kept in three separate ruins...${prompt}
  8364: ${name-player}, we need you to travel to Ro'Maeve, the Chamber of Oracles, and the Temple of Uggalepih to collect those verses.${prompt}
  8365: I don'taru know what form they will take, but they should at leastaru be recognizable as a legacy left for succeeding generations.${prompt}
  8366: Semih Lafihna, go to Chieftainness Perih Vashai and explain the situation.${prompt}
  8367: If something should happen to the Star Sibyl, the Tarutaru will completaruly lose their marbles, not to mention their will to fight.${prompt}
  8368: And you can bet the Yagudo will choose that exactaru moment to attack. Windurst will be annihilated before you can spit outaru “deranged, drooling dhalmels”...${prompt}
  8369: The Mithra must be ready to take the front line in such a battle. Your strength and prowess will be sorely needed, Semih Lafihna.${prompt}
  8370: '...I understand. I will confer with Chieftainness Perih Vashai and prepare for a Yagudo attack.${prompt}'
  8371: But do your utmost to make sure that such an attack doesn't happen, Minister Ajido-Marujido...${prompt}
  8372: |-
    And lastaruly...
    Apururu, we were talking about the possibility of disabling the Cardians. Can it really be done?${prompt}
  8373: '...Yes, I believe it can. If the mana orbs within the Cardians are struck with a strong enough blasty-wast of the Stars and the Moon, their motive systems will be disruptarued.${prompt}'
  8374: This disruption will only last a short while, but during that time they will be completely doozy-woozy and unable to act.${prompt}
  8375: A sliver-wiver of time in which to rescue the Star Sibyl...${prompt}
  8376: But where do we find such a source of power? And will you be capable of wielding it?${prompt}
  8377: Don't worry about me, dear brother! I learned a few new things while you were lostaru to us!${prompt}
  8378: Hrmph. Taught a few black arts by a certain Tarutaru is more like it.${prompt}
  8379: No...nothing like that! Rightaru, I must be going!${prompt}
  8380: Don't go hurting yourself, Apururu.${prompt}
  8381: (Something just doesn't make sense...)${prompt}
  8382: (Karaha-Baruha... How could a genius like you not realize the art of complete summoning would rob you of your life?)${prompt}
  8383: (...But if...)${prompt}
  8384: (But if you had foreseen that outcome, what if you had predictarued this entire scenario...?)${prompt}
  8385: '${name-player}!${wait-animation: 1}'
  8386: '...You made it back in time.${prompt}'
  8387: ${name-player} is no ordinary adventurer, Semih Lafihna.${prompt}
  8388: So it would seem.${prompt}
  8389: We've been waiting for you. Actually, we were slightaruly worried you wouldn't be able to gather all the verses before the show started.${prompt}
  8390: While you've been out hop-popping all over the place, we've had a message from the King of the Yagudo announcing the imminentaru abolishment of the peace treaty.${prompt}
  8391: You realize what this means, don't you? Abolishing the peace treaty is akin to a declaration of war.${prompt}
  8392: If we don't send a reply surrendering control of the Horutoto Ruins within the period stated, we can consider ourselves at war with the Yagudo. Very little time remains to us...${prompt}
  8393: And to Joker's lifespan as well, I should imagine...${prompt}
  8394: '...What do you mean by that?${prompt}'
  8395: A doll only lives a certain amountaru of time corresponding to the amountaru of magic its creator poured into it during creation.${prompt}
  8396: I asked the children at the port about the date of Joker's resurrection. I did some calculations...${prompt}
  8397: And from what the results tell me, it would seem that Joker's clock will soon tick its last tock. Joker is probably also well aware of his predicamentaru.${prompt}
  8398: Just a moment, Ajido-Marujido. What does the time remaining to Joker have to do with the deadline given to us by the Yagudo?${prompt}
  8399: The Cardians and the Yagudo have some kind of deal going on. You really should have noticed it by now.${prompt}
  8400: Think about the incidentaru where the talisman was stolen from the Chamber of Light. That room can only be opened by myself, a Cardian, or a representative of Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  8401: To top it off, this treaty business comes at the worstaru possible time for us.${prompt}
  8402: Either they know that the Star Sibyl is missing, or that Windurst is particularly vulnerable right now...${prompt}
  8403: Are you saying that the Star Sibyl has fallen into the Yagudo's talons!?${prompt}
  8404: No, no. Think about it. If that was the case they wouldn'taru have given us a deadline. The Yagudo are simply waiting for Joker to expire.${prompt}
  8405: This is justaru speculation on my part, but I would say relations between the Yagudo and the Cardians wentaru decidedly downhill after Joker took up the Cardian crown.${prompt}
  8406: '...But wait! That doesn''t make any sense! Does this mean Joker is friend or foe, good or evil...?${prompt}'
  8407: It's entirely possible that he is neither friend nor foe.${prompt}
  8408: Appearing at night, and fading with the day... Justaru like the will of the Great Beast...${prompt}
  8409: Ajido-Marujido! It's ready at lastaru!${prompt}
  8410: We didn't have time to test it, but I had the help of three professors! It should work perfectaruly!${prompt}
  8411: Hrm. With three professors helping you, there's little chance of it not working. It's the chance that they were a little over-enthusiastic that worries me...${prompt}
  8412: Well, we've done everything that we can.${prompt}
  8413: There's little pointaru to sitting around imagining what's going to happen. Only time will tell.${prompt}
  8414: |-
    The momentaru has come!
    To the Full Moon Fountain!${prompt}
  8415: '...You understand, don''t you, ${name-player}?${prompt}'
  8416: The only people aware of this situation are myself, the Sibyl Guards, Ajido-Marujido, his sister Apururu, and you.${prompt}
  8417: The future of Windurst is in your hands. You must liberataru the Star Sibyl by any means possible.${prompt}
  8418: A letter has arrived from the Yagudo. Sibyl Guard Semih Lafihna's face has been all stormy-wormy since she read it.${prompt}
  8419: And I haven'taru had a glimpse of the Star Sibyl since that bearer of darkness affair. All this doom and gloom is making me sick with worry.${prompt}
  8420: I heard that lots of those feral-weral Cardians were on the move across Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  8421: I wonder if their creator, Zonpa-Zippa, could've tamed them had he been here.${prompt}
  8422: The Mithran Chieftainness was here at Heavens Tower just a little while ago. Semih Lafihna explained to her that the Star Sibyl wasn't taking visitors at the momentaru.${prompt}
  8423: Those two Mithra don't look anything alike, but there's something similar about their auras. The chieftainness and Semih Lafihna both carry the scent of the wilds with them.${prompt}
  8424: Do you really think the Yagudo are, like, serious about keeping up this whole peace treaty thing?${prompt}
  8425: I was born after the Great War, so I don'taru know anything about battle or stuff like that. But I think it must be, like, totally difficult to forget all the death and suffering caused by the war.${prompt}
  8426: We've got the bearer of darkness, the Cardians, and the Yagudo. Windurst sure does seem to have a lot of enemies, despite our continued efforts at peace.${prompt}
  8427: Is this some sort of test, I wonder? The citizens of Windurst mustaru give their full support... The burden is too great for the Star Sibyl to carry alone.${prompt}
  8428: When the bearer of darkness appeared, all Heruru did was tell the other ladies-in-waiting to calm down without giving any useful direction.${prompt}
  8429: Heruru can'taru bear to face Zubaba after taking her tutelage in this area. Heruru should have been the one to calm down first.${prompt}
  8430: The strenuously striving Sibyl Guards seem terribly tired. They don't seem to have a moment to relax.${prompt}
  8431: I prepared some snacks to refresh their lagging lackluster spirits, but the Mithra probably aren't fond of sweets...${prompt}
  8432: It's almost time for the Star Sibyl's Star Reading, but I can'taru see it hippy-hoppy-happening this time.${prompt}
  8433: And now the Yagudo send us this demand to kooky-kacky-kick us while were down. Why do bad things always seem to come in deluges like this?${prompt}
  8434: Heavens Tower has returned to its peaceful state as if nothing had ever happened...${prompt}
  8435: Everyone carries unease in their hearts, though. With the absence of the Star Sibyl, a gloomy, gloomy pall has fallen over us all.${prompt}
  8436: These days Sibyl Guard Semih Lafihna is always rushing around. <Frown>${prompt}
  8437: Kupipi and Lady Zubaba seem buried in their duties as well. This all started when the Star Sibyl took ill, and it's been that way ever since. <Wince>${prompt}
  8438: I h-heard that lots of Cord--Cardians went down to the lower levels of the H-horutoto Ruins' central tower.${prompt}
  8439: Isn't the r-reason Minister Ajido-Marujido was s-sent to the Dork--Dark Dungeon down there!?${prompt}
  8440: With the Star Sibyl cloistered in her chambers, Heavens Tower has totally lostaru its light, cheery-weery atmosphere.${prompt}
  8441: But we ladies-in-waiting mustaru go on being our usual perky-werky selves. I can't let my bed-making standards drop just because times are tough!${prompt}
  8442: I ca～n't get the Star Sibyl's signature for orders that are issued from Heavens Tower!${prompt}
  8443: Extremely impo～rtantaru documents need to be processed! Please help the Star Sibyl!${prompt}
  8444: Why do the Yagudo have to stick their beaks in at a time like this!?${prompt}
  8445: Without the Star Sibyl here, we can't send an apology or even a declaration of war if it comes to that!${prompt}
  8446: Looks like the Yagudo are just itching to pick a fight with us.${prompt}
  8447: But the Star Sibyl will be the Star Sibyl. Why did she ever agrrree to sign such a prrroblematic treaty?${prompt}
  8448: At times like this, the Star Sibyl's stamina and spirrrit are being put to the test.${prompt}
  8449: We must rescue her from those puppets as soon as possible, but Semih Lafihna has yet to give the orrrder. I suppose just rushing in might make things worrrse...${prompt}
  8450: Semih Lafihna awaits you in the Vestal Chamber.${prompt}
  8451: Semih Lafihna awaits you in the Star Sibyl's chamberrrs.${prompt}
  8452: Let us join our strength and change the flow of fate.${prompt}
  8453: A need to fight comes from one's own weakness. A weakness born from lack of rrresolve, impatience, and fear. We must rrrise above all these to grasp a higher power.${prompt}
  8454: "You look nervous. \nI understand. A heavy fate rides upon your shoulderrrs.${prompt}"
  8455: You must believe in yourself. There is nothing in this world that cannot be changed. Even a situation seemingly without hope can be rescued from the depths of despairrr.${prompt}
  8456: Semih Lafihna has given her orrrders. The time has come for the Sibyl Guards to unsheathe our claws and fight with all our strrrength...${prompt}
  8457: ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8458: |-
    The Star Sibyl is resting.
    The ceremony at the Full Moon Fountain has drained her. It will probably be some time until she recovers.${prompt}
  8459: Along with Joker, all of the Cardians that were in that place have returned to nothing more than ordinary puppets.${prompt}
  8460: The power of the Stars and the Moon that was stored in their Mana Orbs, the small amountaru of that same energy left in the fountain, and the magic of the Star Sibyl's Diza Star...${prompt}
  8461: All of it was consumed to revive the Great Beast, Fenrir.${prompt}
  8462: |-
    That is the Moon Reading...
    The power to grantaru wishes.${prompt}
  8463: It may take some time until Fenrir is back to his legendary strength, however...${prompt}
  8464: Windurst has regained the protection of the Stars and the Moon. Our fair land will once again be visitarued by serene, twinkling evenings and peaceful dreams.${prompt}
  8465: |-
    Ajido-Marujido.
    ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8466: Semih Lafihna. You're back. I bet those Yagudo were screeching for blood.${prompt}
  8467: Yes, that's why I went to slap them across their collective beaks with their “rrrevisions.”${prompt}
  8468: Now that the Great Beast is back, they won't be trying to get their filthy talons on the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt}
  8469: They're a careful bunch, that's for sure. Now that the Ace Cardians are gone, we can assume they'll hold back on abolishing the peace treaty as well.${prompt}
  8470: But you know they won'taru give up on the ruins that easily.${prompt}
  8471: That is true. But we no longer have any reason to cower from them...${prompt}
  8472: |-
    The Star Sibyl has been freed.
    ...Isn't that right, Ajido-Marujido?${prompt}
  8473: She has found us a new guiding star.${prompt}
  8474: It's strange, but I feel like I've been freed as well... Freed from the spell Karaha-Baruha had over me.${prompt}
  8475: It was almostaru as if I was having my strings pulled by the research left by the great genius...${prompt}
  8476: My theory is that he had predictarued a talented mage like myself would come to prominence after his death.${prompt}
  8477: You flattaru yourself, dear Brother. Karaha-Baruha was more likely aware that a naive, shorty-worty-tempered wizard like you would come along eventually.${prompt}
  8478: What's with you, Apururu? You've got a smartaru mouth on you today.${prompt}
  8479: Things never would've gotten this bad if you wishy-washy slowpokes at the Manustery had done something about the rogue Cardians earlier.${prompt}
  8480: 'Hmph. Keep talking to me like that, and you''ll never get your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} back.${prompt}'
  8481: Ah, finally. Without that ring, I can'taru get into the Minister's Chambers. Not being able to get into my own room is going to do wonders for my reputation as a formidable spell-slinger!${prompt}
  8482: |-
    ${name-player}, what was it that Joker said to you?
    “It was your will that led us to this moment.”${prompt}
  8483: It was your resolution that brought a new beginning for a Windurst that had lost its future.${prompt}
  8484: Where will your determination take you next, I wonder?${prompt}
  8485: Your actions could affect all of us here in Windurst--and those across the breadth of Vana'diel. What do you want to accomplish?${prompt}
  8486: '...Hehehe, there''s no need to answer that. The time will come when your determination will bring you the answers you need.${prompt}'
  8487: If you need any more work, come on over to the Orastery. We have the budgetaru to employ one or two people for experimental purposes.${prompt}
  8488: There are a few new spells I learned from the Book of the Gods that I've been dying to try. I guarantee it'll be a fascinataruing experience.${prompt}
  8489: And you could lend us a hand to bring in all the roguey-wogue Cardians still wandering around the Horutoto Ruins. See you soon, adventurer!${prompt}
  8490: It's time I should be going as well. Don't forget to visit the Star Sibyl before you leave.${prompt}
  8491: Before taking her rest, she mentioned she wanted to talk with you.${prompt}
  8492: |-
    Well, ${name-player}.
    Until the day we once again fight side by side, may the fire in your eyes never fade...${prompt}
  8493: '${name-player}...${wait-animation: 2}'
  8494: I am glad to see you are well. We have not spoken since the events at the fountain, and I have been concerned for you.${prompt}
  8495: The words of the Great Beast found their way to your heart as well, I am sure.${prompt}
  8496: Fenrir has promised a new beginning for Windurst.${prompt}
  8497: But it is only a beginning. With the loss of the Diza Star's power, I can no longer perform the Moon or Star Readings...${prompt}
  8498: I can no longer foresee what fate awaits our dear Windurst. The star that was there to guide me is no more...${prompt}
  8499: But do not worry for me, ${name-player}. I will strive onwards.${prompt}
  8500: Thanks to you, I have found the path that I must take.${prompt}
  8501: I am governed by the citizens of Windurst. My role lies in finding the way that provides for their happiness.${prompt}
  8502: '...${name-player}. You, too, are a citizen of Windurst. And one of the brightest stars that lights my way.${prompt}'
  8503: Let us walk that path together. Away from all that has ended and towards everything that has begun...${prompt}
  8504: We will lead Windurst onwards to a new future.${prompt}
  8505: |-
    ...${name-player}!
    The Star Sibyl has returned to us safely! The future of Windurst has been secured!${prompt}
  8506: You have my deepest gratitude. Even a strong, independent adventurer like yourself must have realized--the Star Sibyl is the wellspring of courage and spirit for all the citizens of Windurst.${prompt}
  8507: You have done more than simply save the Star Sibyl--you have rescued the heart and soul of the people.${prompt}
  8508: I once heard that even a tiny-winy prayer, if enough people believe in it, will grow into a great wish with enough strength to reach the stars...${prompt}
  8509: I wonder if our simple prayer was enough? For the Star Sibyl's sake, we will keep on wishing and believing.${prompt}
  8510: Is it true that the Star Sibyl defeatarued the Bearer of Darkness?${prompt}
  8511: You were there when it happened, rightaru? I wish I could've been there to see the glorious-worious spectacle of our courageous Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  8512: A little while ago, the Mithran chieftainness came to speak with the Star Sibyl on an importantaru matter.${prompt}
  8513: Please don'taru be alarmed. The chieftainness left Heavens Tower with a mostaru serene expression upon her face. It seems their audience concluded on a satisfactory note.${prompt}
  8514: |-
    Semih Lafihna left to deliver Windurst's reply to the Yagudo, but...
    She was, like, totally armed for battle...${prompt}
  8515: I guess the Yagudo aren'taru gonna like what the letter has to say. If the Yagudo get all miffed and stuff, what's gonna happen? It kinda stresses me out, y'know?${prompt}
  8516: The Sibyl Guards were saying that we have no more to fear from the Cardians or the Bearer of Darkness.${prompt}
  8517: According to them, the Bearer of Darkness was clobber-wobbered by you, the Star Sibyl, and the Orastery minister.${prompt}
  8518: And Minister Apururu of the Manustery has the job of rounding up the remaining feral-weral Cardians. That really puts my mind at easey-wease.${prompt}
  8519: Heruru has heard that the Diza Star has been worn by generations of Star Sibyls.${prompt}
  8520: But even with the loss of the Diza Star's power, the light still shines warmly down upon Windurst...${prompt}
  8521: The Star Sibyl enfolds us all in her heavenly splendor.${prompt}
  8522: The Sibyl Guards seem to have sustained injuries during their sporadic scuffles with the Cardians.${prompt}
  8523: The wounds were mostaruly cuts and bruises, but injuries are injuries. They should be taking it easy-weasy for a while.${prompt}
  8524: Now that I think about it, the feral-weral Cardians have simply been seeky-scoury-searching for a place to live.${prompt}
  8525: It's said that Cardians have no heart, but if that were true, why would they have racy-ricy-run away in the first place? I hippy-hoppy-hope they can find happiness in this time of peace.${prompt}
  8526: Now that the Star Sibyl is back with us, the ladies-in-waiting can truly, truly smile again.${prompt}
  8527: With the trying events she has been through lately, I don'taru think the Star Sibyl is taking visitors...but for you, she might make a tiny, tiny exception.${prompt}
  8528: |-
    The Star Sibyl's pain is our pain.
    We share the pain between us so we don't overtax our Tarutaru-sized frames. <Proclaims>${prompt}
  8529: |-
    The Star Sibyl's joy is our joy.
    And because of our Tarutaru-sized frames, even the smallest joy is still enough to share. <Declare>${prompt}
  8530: |-
    Oh, ${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Miss] Adventurer!
    I-is it true that the magical p-power has returned to the Harry--Horutoto Ruins!?${prompt}
  8531: Of c-course it is still f-forbidden to enter the ruins, so nobody really knows. B-but the moog--mages say that they can sense the energy!${prompt}
  8532: Making beds and sweeping floors, oh what a lovely day.♪${prompt}
  8533: Things have finally returned to normal in Heavens Tower. Lady Zubaba is back to her usual naggy-waggy self, which is the bestaru indication that all is well in Windurst.${prompt}
  8534: There hasn't been a rank ten adventurer around here for deca～des!!!${prompt}
  8535: I can'taru even fi～nd the proper forms that deal with someone of that status!!! No～body reaches rank ten these days!${prompt}
  8536: You know how the Yagudo have become so fixated on the magic towerrrs in Sarutabaruta? It must have something to do with the massive destruction wrrrought upon them by the summoning twenty years ago.${prompt}
  8537: The Yagudo have lived in this region for far longer than the Mithra. They probably have as much knowledge about the towers as the Tarutaru.${prompt}
  8538: So the Bearer of Darkness was really a manifestation of both Karaha-Baruha and the Grrreat Beast, Fenrir?${prompt}
  8539: |-
    The resurrection of Karaha-Baruha led to the revival of the Great Beast...
    People coming back from the dead is against the naturrral order of things. I'm not surprrrised that it led to these terrible events.${prompt}
  8540: The ceremony performed by the Star Sibyl at the Full Moon Fountain is known as the Moon Reading.${prompt}
  8541: The Moon Reading uses the powerrr of the Stars and the Moon to grant one tremendous wish. It is this power that has allowed the cheerful Tarutaru to exist in this land for as long as they have.${prompt}
  8542: Semih Lafihna and Chieftainness Perih Vashai have been holding talks on what to do concerning the Yagudo.${prompt}
  8543: Things probably won't change for a while yet. A prrrotracted battle is the same as a defeat. First we need to increase our military strength.${prompt}
  8544: By killing the Great Beast, Karaha-Baruha saved Windurst from its fate of destruction.${prompt}
  8545: Even among the Tarutaru, there are those whose blood sings with passion and courage. Even we Mithra hold his name in high esteem.${prompt}
  8546: Rank ten... This is uncha～rted territory...${prompt}
  8547: Congratula～tions! To commemorate the occasion, your deeds are to be put in a book and kept in the library!${prompt}

  8549: Oh, wait a minutaru. It seems that since the events you took part in are too sensitive to be released to the public, your book is to be placed in the restricted section.${prompt}

  8554: Do～n't try to hide it. I know exa～ctly how you feel!${prompt}
  8555: This secretary is going to do some se～rious butt kicking and show those pompous Elvaan and those flip-flopping Humes who's boss!${prompt}

    Welcome, ${name-player}.
    You have come to speak with me of Conflict?${prompt}
  8559: A powerful light radiates from your spirit. I sense that light is to become the guiding star that leads our forces to victory.${prompt}
  8560: |-
    However...
    While Conflict may be a simple series of exercises, I am troubled by the fact that our nations feel compelled to resolve their differences with such violent methods.${prompt}
  8561: The mere mention of battle has the Mithra sharpening their claws and Orastery members plotting revenge against their rivals.${prompt}
  8562: This obsession for victory has caused them to lose sight of the true meaning behind Conflict.${prompt}
  8563: And ultimately, their warped sense of anger will only overflow and flood the hearts and minds of my children with meaningless hate.${prompt}
  8564: Fortunately, my dear Kupipi provided me insight on a plan that would protect the integrity of our peoples while still benefiting the three nations.${prompt}
  8565: That plan involves you adventurers. I hear tales every day of how people with the power to single-handedly defeat armies stop to lend their hands to those in need.${prompt}
  8566: Kupipi suggested that heroes such as yourself would be much better suited to represent our nation than those whose minds may be clouded by ulterior motives.${prompt}
  8567: Please, ${name-player}. I ask that you represent Windurst in Conflict and show its people the true meaning behind the games.${prompt}
  8568: Show them that love for one's nation does not need encompass hate for another. Show them that it is honor, not revenge, that should drive us.${prompt}
  8569: Let your radiance be our guiding light.${prompt}
  8570: And do not forget, no matter where the stars lead you, I will always be watching.${prompt}
  8571: |-
    Co～nflict?
    You wouldn't happen to be one of those adventurers from ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok], would you?${prompt}

    We～lcome, we～lcome!

  8574: |-
    Come on, come on! Don't be shy.
    Just keep quiet and follow me...and don't touch anything!${prompt}
  8575: I welcome you, brave adventurer, and commend you on your long journey.${prompt}
  8576: You have come seeking permission to participate in Conflict. I sense no reason to deny you that permission, however...${prompt}
  8577: |-
    ${name-player}...
    Do you join your nation's forces to prove your bravery?${prompt}
  8578: Or is it that you simply desire victory for your kingdom?${prompt}
  8579: The light your star emits has lost its radiance. I sense you have done no wrong, but your homeland has committed many terrible sins in the past.${prompt}
  8580: Long before you were born, San d'Oria brought much pain and suffering to the continent of Mindartia.${prompt}
  8581: However, this is nothing you need be ashamed of.${prompt}
  8582: The time has come for those with fearless hearts to learn there are some things that must be feared.${prompt}
  8583: The star of Windurst shall show you and your nation the truth.${prompt}

    ${name-player}...
    Do you join your nation's forces to boast your strength?${prompt}
  8585: Or do you raise your flags in the false name of justice?${prompt}
  8586: The light your star emits has lost its radiance. I sense you have done no wrong, but over the centuries your homeland has committed many acts most unjust.${prompt}
  8587: Long before you were born, Bastok used harsh, unspeakable tactics to defeat their enemies, and in the process fouled the seas of Elshimo--all this in the name of victory and justice.${prompt}
  8588: However, this is nothing you need be ashamed of.${prompt}
  8589: The time has come for those obsessed with advancement to look back on the tattered past they have left behind.${prompt}
  8590: The star of Windurst shall show you and your nation the truth.${prompt}
  8591: And the～re you have it.${prompt}
  8592: You've been given the stamp of approval. You've been rated grade-A. You're ready to be packed up and shipped out.${prompt}
  8593: Now go talk with Captain Mhabi Molkot and you'll be set.${prompt}
  8594: 'Oh, and a bit of advice from me to you: don''t think that this is going to be an～ything like fighting those airheaded beastmen.${prompt}'
  8595: Stay on your toes, or you'll be lying face down in the mu～d, back on the gra～ss, eating breakfast with the wor～ms.${prompt}

  8610: Just a moment.${prompt}
  8611: Prince Trion, is there something you wish to add?${prompt}
  8612: |-
    ...
    I will not deny that the participation of adventurers has been of great benefit to the conquest, as well as maintained a new level of safety in the outlying regions.${prompt}
  8613: In addition, the many treaties signed by our nations have successfully paved a path of peace. No longer need our border guards fear attacks from our friends to the south and east.${prompt}
  8614: However, the beastman forces display no signs of weakening. Those noble guards stationed in faraway lands must deal with this reality constantly...and the burden has begun taking its toll.${prompt}
  8615: The already large gap between the guards on our borders and the guards in the Outlands expands with each day. If nothing is done, morale shall continue to fall while discontent grows.${prompt}
  8616: I sense that my kingdom is not alone in these worries.${prompt}
  8617: Soldier morale...${prompt}
  8618: Well, well, well! I never thought I'd see such a lack of confidence from a member of the mighty d'Oraguille family!${prompt}
  8619: |-
    Ohohoho!
    I never thought I'd see such a lack of confidence
    from Destin's baby boy--Trion, the prince.${prompt}
  8620: How dare you!?${prompt}
  8621: I think that is quite enough, Minister.${prompt}
  8622: I fully understand the concerns of Prince Trion, and believe he has a point.${prompt}
  8623: |-
    Doctor Shantotto...
    I fully understand the concerns of Prince Trion, and believe he has a point.${prompt}
  8624: In a republic like Bastok, where a large portion of our army is made up of normal citizens, it is easy for morale levels to slide. This is a problem that is constantly being tackled by our officials.${prompt}
  8625: |-
    Really?
    Well, that's your nation. Windurst doesn't face such problems.${prompt}
  8626: Our Mithran Mercenaries enjoy being sent to far-off places. It gives them the opportunity to run and jump and hunt and roll around in the mud--whatever those feminine felines like to do in their free time.${prompt}
  8627: Maybe instead of buffing up your soldiers' muscles all day, you should try training their minds...like we do. And that's my two gil!${prompt}
  8628: |-
    Oh, rea～lly?
    Well, that's your nation.
    We don't have such problems in the Federation.${prompt}
  8629: "Our Mithran Mercenaries enjoy being sent to faraway places. \nIt gives them time to take their naps, hunt their mice, and go on their chases.${prompt}"
  8630: |-
    Maybe it's to the lack of confidence that you can give thanks
    for the drastic fall of morale in your pathetic ranks.${prompt}
  8631: '...${prompt}'
  8632: Yes, but hiring mercenaries can be quite the burden on the Federation's treasury, can it not?${prompt}
  8633: Yes, but hiring mercenaries can be quite the burden on the Federation's treasury, can it not?${prompt}
  8634: The more regions under your nation's control, the more mercenaries you must hire. And before you realize it, your vaults will be empty.${prompt}
  8635: I suspect that the conquest is taking its toll on the Federation.${prompt}
  8636: Well, we...${prompt}
  8637: |-
    Ohohohoho!
    In a matter of months, our wishy-worries will be gone,

    O～hohohohoho!${prompt}

  8646: But wouldn't the use of automatons in the conquest be in violation of the Treaty of Nations...?${prompt}

    Hmph.
    And I have heard many a tale of those walking scarecrows turning on their masters...${prompt}
  8648: |-
    Like father, like son, I say.
    I would not trust a lump of rubbish made by one of you lunatics any more than I would trust one of you lunatics!${prompt}
  8649: How can one call a soldier that does not obey his leader a soldier? And how can one call a leader who cannot control his soldiers a leader?${prompt}
  8650: Ooh, somebody's in a bad mood...${prompt}
  8651: |-
    Prince Trion.
    You certainly did not bring up this issue without having a solution in mind.${prompt}
  8652: |-
    Exactly!
    You'd better have something interesting to say.
    Or Ajido and I will pack up our things and be on our way.${prompt}
  8653: Recently one of our Royal Knights made his return journey from our kingdom's territories to the north--Lord Excenmille.${prompt}
  8654: Excenmille? The man who, after the Great War, took a handful of soldiers and successfully invaded the Orcish Empire using guerilla tactics?${prompt}
  8655: |-
    Yes.
    Sword in hand, donning armor stained with the blood of a thousand foes, he returned to his homeland for the first time in twenty years...and was shocked at what he found lurking beyond its gates.${prompt}
  8656: Foreign merchants of all shapes and sizes peddling their trinkets. Scruffy adventurers shouting out their petty problems as they walked freely among the streets and alleys. Local shopkeeps and Temple Knights laughing as they mingled with the scum washed up from all corners of the continent.${prompt}
  8657: Excenmille was furious.${prompt}
  8658: Why would he be furious? The influx of adventurers has revitalized your nation.${prompt}
  8659: According to Excenmille, twenty-five years ago, a union among the children of Altana was necessary to defeat the armies of darkness.${prompt}
  8660: However, now that the threat has gone, there is no reason for San d'Oria's citizens to be brushing shoulders with the common folk of other nations. It is this symbiotic relationship that plagues the Kingdom and keeps the once mighty red lion shackled down.${prompt}
  8661: That seems like quite an anachronous opinion...${prompt}
  8662: Excenmille's way of thinking may seem out-of-date, but his logic cannot be denied. Ever since the opening of our gates to outsiders, the quality of our knights has fallen dramatically.${prompt}
  8663: |-
    ...
    I'm tired of hearing stories about some pumpkin-bumpkin knight.
    Are you going to get to the point, or are we going to be here all night?${prompt}
  8664: Excenmille offered me with the following suggestion...${prompt}
  8665: Revive Conflict!${prompt}
  8666: '...${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  8667: '...!?${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  8668: |-
    C-Conflict!?
    A series of games based on battle exercises, played by select heroes from each of the nations...${prompt}
  8669: |-
    Due to the extreme level of danger involved, it was banned well before the Great War.
    You are not suggesting that we reinstate Conflict, are you?${prompt}
  8670: That is what I propose.${prompt}
  8671: |-
    Conflict...
    An interesting idea...${prompt}
  8672: There was once a time when Conflict ignited the spirits of the people of Bastok--players and fans alike.${prompt}
  8673: However, after numerous “accidents,” the games were deemed a bad influence on the Republic's image, and were banned by law.${prompt}
  8674: If Conflict was reinstated, it could re-ignite the flames in the hearts of all Bastokers and renew their faith in the Republican Army. Morale would be restored, and our problems solved.${prompt}
  8675: |-
    Prince Trion, Prince Trion.
    If that's all that you wanted to say,
    you didn't have to go beat around the bush all day.${prompt}
  8676: |-
    Windurst welcomes Conflict with open arms!
    A little feuding fun could do no harm.${prompt}
  8677: Shantotto!?${prompt}
  8678: |-
    Oh, there's nothing to get all excited about. The forces of Windurst are in good hands.
    A couple of knutty knights and measly musketeers are no match for Shantotto's superior battle plans.${prompt}

    About ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1}.

    Nothing at the moment.${prompt}
  8694: Ballista is an exercise once used by the San d'Orian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word “ballista” means “to throw a stone,” and the game has been a part of Vana'dielian military history for centuries.${prompt}
  8695: |-
    The rules are simple.
    Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vana'diel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.${prompt}
  8696: 'Players from both teams must search for ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} that a ${color: 5}Herald${color: 1} has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  8697: 'These ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} into them.${prompt}'
  8698: Finally, a player's strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.${prompt}
  8699: '${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the ${color: 5}Quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.${prompt}'
  8700: 'Sometimes a player may find items other than ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}, such as potions. These ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).${prompt}'
  8701: |-
    Players can carry more than one ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, but they cannot throw the stones away once they have obtained them.
    However, players will lose their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} if they:
    (1) Successfully throw them into a rook.
    (2) Leave the area.
    (3) Are knocked out.${prompt}
  8702: 'But don''t forget, a player will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command while in possession of a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. And, players can only use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command if they carry one of the stones.${prompt}'
  8703: As one can see, careful planning and impeccable timing are the keys to victory.${prompt}
  8704: 'All participants of Ballista will have the ability to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. This will temporarily increase one''s movement speed, creating a better chance to find and obtain ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  8705: 'However, remember that once a player has obtained a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, he or she will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. In its place, though, one may use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command.${prompt}'
  8706: 'The locations of the ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} are constantly changing. This makes it quite difficult to find the targets by just randomly walking about the area.${prompt}'
  8707: 'Communication with one''s team members is, of course, one way to locate ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}. However, another way is by using the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command. This will inform a player of the approximate location of the nearest ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  8708: 'Finally, ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} can only be used when a player is carrying a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. Because ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used at this time, players must be weary of approaching enemies.${prompt}'
  8709: 'So, a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} has been obtained and a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1} located. Now all that''s left is tossing the stone in, right? Wrong.${prompt}'
  8710: There is one aspect of Ballista that has yet to be mentioned...and this is where the real battle begins.${prompt}
  8711: 'To throw a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} into a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}, a player must first wait until the ${color: 5}Rook''s${color: 1} gate is open. This takes impeccable timing, as the gate is only open for a short while.${prompt}'
  8712: |-
    But not just anyone can score points this way. A player must first take down a member of the opposing team and achieve ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status.
    Only then will his or her shots count.${prompt}
  8713: This extreme method of combat is what made the ancient game of Ballista famous, and transformed its participants into heroes.${prompt}
  8714: Running about looking for stones is no different from a child's game of hide-and-seek. Knowing when to strike is what separates the men from the boys.${prompt}
  8715: |-
    The following match types are area-specific:
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Allowed: Jugner Forest
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Restricted: Pashhow Marshlands
    Best of Three (three matches) * Normal Items Allowed: Meriphataud Mountains${prompt}
  8716: |-
    ${color: 5}Best of Three${color: 1} series rules are as follows:
    Winning a match will earn a nation one “match point.” The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for “come-from-behind” victories.${prompt}
  8717: Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nation's forces.${prompt}
  8718: Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.${prompt}
  8719: When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.${prompt}
  8720: For more information on temporary items, refer to the “special rules.”${prompt}
  8721: After being KO'd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.${prompt}
  8722: If a player chooses to return to their force's camp, HP and MP will be fully restored, but all TP will be lost.${prompt}

  8848: You think that just because you have a few missions under your belt that you're ready to play with the big boys!?${prompt}
  8849: Well, soldier, I've scraped bigger things than you off the bottom of my boot!${prompt}
  8850: |-
    Listen up!
    My name is Invincible Shield, Legatus of the third division of the Republican Legion.${prompt}
  8851: The president himself has made me Conflict Commander and put the Bastokan forces under my control. If you join, you will serve under me and under me only!${prompt}
  8852: |-
    What!? You have questions about Conflict!?
    I don't remember anyone giving you permission to ask questions, soldier!${prompt}
  8853: |-
    I will let it slide this time, but it better not happen again!
    Now, listen up!${prompt}
  8854: |-
    Did you understand what I just told you!?
    It is an honor and a privilege to participate in Conflict!${prompt}
  8855: |-
    You want to be a hero!? Well, here's your chance, soldier!
    Sign this application form and you can be on your way!${prompt}
  8856: |-
    More time!?
    And I thought you were more than just a whining sissy!
    The Republic doesn't need any more wimps like you!
    You are dismissed!${prompt}
  8857: So, you have finally realized your debt to the Kingdom and decided to repay that debt through service in Conflict?${prompt}
  8858: Well, look who's back. I knew you couldn't rrresist the excitement of Conflict. You're ready to sign up, right?${prompt}
  8859: |-
    I see that you have finally come to your senses, soldier!
    Now sign this application and you can be on your way!${prompt}
  8860: |-
    Excellent.
    However, there is one last task I must ask you to perform before approving your application.${prompt}
  8861: Travel to Bastok and Windurst and meet with their leaders. You need not worry with the details. They already know you will be coming.${prompt}
  8862: I also wish you to deliver these letters to the two nations' Conflict Commanders.${prompt}
  8863: A lofty Galka, Ginu...Invincible Shield, will be waiting for you in Bastok.${prompt}
  8864: And I recall the Commander of Windurst's forces was a Mithra named Mhabi...something-or-other. I have such trouble remembering foreign names.${prompt}
  8865: |-
    That is all. You may set off immediately.
    I must say, I am quite honored to send such a fine adventurer as yourself to represent the Kingdom.${prompt}
  8866: |-
    Wonderful!
    I know you'rrre ready to get out there and starrrt fighting right away, but before you do, you'rrre going to need a license.${prompt}
  8867: To get a license, you'll need to meet the leaders of the other two nations.${prompt}
  8868: And--you thought that was it?--you'll need to take these letters to the Conflict Commanders of San d'Oria and Bastok.${prompt}
  8869: I don't know much about the two, but the Commander of Bastok is some thousand-year-old gut-busterrr named Invincible Shield. I think I rememberrr the one from San d'Oria being some cold-blooded Elvaan named Excenmille.${prompt}
  8870: Now get going! The faster you get this done, the quicker you can be exchanging blows with those boneheads from the other nations!${prompt}
  8871: |-
    Heh heh heh...
    When they see who I've sent to them, they'll be shaking in their greaves!${prompt}
  8872: |-
    You've made the right choice, soldier!
    From this day on, you are an official member of the Bastokan Conflict forces!${prompt}
  8873: |-
    Now listen up, because I'm about to give you your first orders, and I'm only going to say them once!
    You are to infiltrate the enemies' cities and meet with their leaders!${prompt}
  8874: |-
    What!?
    Who are the enemy? Where have you been the last twenty-five years, living in a hole!?
    The enemy are the Elvaan and the Tarutaru!${prompt}
  8875: |-
    After meeting with their leaders, you are to deliver these correspondences to the Conflict Commanders of those nations!
    Don't worry, you'll have no trouble finding those half-rate cowards!${prompt}
  8876: |-
    Look for Excenmille in San d'Oria and Mhabi in Windurst!
    Just the sound of their names makes me want to puke!${prompt}
  8877: |-
    You have your orders, now make your final preparations and be on your way! You have ten, no, eight minutes!
    Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  8878: Is something the matter? You are to meet the leaders of Bastok and Windurst.${prompt}
  8879: Also, give the letters I handed you to the Conflict Commanders Invincible Shield and Mhabi...something-or-other.${prompt}
  8880: What's wrong? Hurry up and meet the leaders of Bastok and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  8881: Oh, and don't forrrget to give my letters to Invincible Shield and Excenmille.${prompt}
  8882: Don't even tell me that you forgot your orders! I've met tunnel worms with better memories than you!${prompt}
  8883: |-
    Now listen up, soldier!
    After meeting with the leaders of San d'Oria and Windurst, you are to deliver the correspondences I handed you to the Conflict Commanders Excenmille and Mhabi Molkot!
    And I don't want to see your pathetic face until you've completed your mission! Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  8884: |-
    Welcome back from your journey.
    ......A ha ha ha! So old Ginuva was not pleased with the content of my letter. I can just imagine how he must have looked after reading it.${prompt}
  8885: |-
    Well done, ${name-player}.
    Now, all that remains is for you to pledge your loyalty before the royaulais. Proceed immediately to the chateau. We would not want to keep His Highness waiting.${prompt}
  8886: |-
    Welcome back! I was beginning to worrrry that you got lost!
    ...Heh heh heh! Those two buffoons were rubbed the wrong way by my letters? Hah hah! Thanks, ${name-player}. You've just made my day.${prompt}
  8887: Now, all that's left is for you to talk to little Kupipi over there and have her take you to the Star Sibyl. When you'rrre done, you can tell me more about your trip.${prompt}
  8888: |-
    Well done, soldier!
    I can tell by the look on your face that those two sissies in Windurst and San d'Oria weren't pleased with the letters I had you deliver. Well, that's too bad!${prompt}
  8889: |-
    If a leader cannot stay calm in a tense situation, he'll pay for it with his men's lives!
    Don't you forget that, soldier!${prompt}
  8890: |-
    Now make your way to the President's Office! Without our leader's permission, you are nothing more than a mangy dog in a uniform!
    Get moving!${prompt}
  8891: 'I commend you, ${name-player}. You have done well in completing the tasks I set before you. You shall make a fine soldier. Now let me present you with your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  8892: This license allows you participation in the traditional San d'Orian battle exercise known as Ballista.${prompt}
  8893: As this sport has its origins in our kingdom, anything less than victory shall not be accepted.${prompt}
  8894: |-
    Ah, I almost forgot.
    Currently, the reinstatement of Conflict is only temporary. Much has changed since it was first followed many years ago.${prompt}
  8895: |-
    Because of this, there is a great chance that many of the existing rules may be changed, and the whole system outlawed for good. If you have any opinions on the games, I suggest you are vocal with them.
    That is all.${prompt}
  8896: 'OK! You''rrre done. Here''s your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  8897: With this license, you'll be able to parrrticipate in one of San d'Oria's old Conflict events--Ballista. I would have preferrrred something more exciting--more Mithran--but I guess this will have to do for now.${prompt}
  8898: And no matter the game, the best will always win, so we have nothing to worry about! Right, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  8899: |-
    Oh yeah, I almost forgot...
    Conflict's rrreinstatement still isn't one hundred percent official. I don't know what those politicians are worrrried about, but I guess that's why I'm not a politician.${prompt}
  8900: They did say something about changing the rules if the players werrre not satisfied with the current ones. So remember to speak up if you want your voice hearrrd!${prompt}
  8901: |-
    Well done, soldier!
    I expect the best, and I give the best! Take this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}
  8902: The Ballista License authorizes your participation in the San d'Orian battle exercise known by the same name.${prompt}
  8903: We must meet the enemy with our blood, our valor, our very lives, to prove to the world that the forces of the Republic are undefeatable!${prompt}
  8904: In addition, you are not to forget that the rules of Conflict are subject to change without notice!${prompt}
  8905: |-
    While I don't think it is a good idea, the IRNC has decided to listen to the opinions of you adventurers in order to improve Ballista. I say, if you can't take the heat, then stay out of the kitchen!
    Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  8906: I happen to be carrying with me a revised edition of the Ballista rulebook. Listen carefully...${prompt}
  8907: |-
    All right, soldier, listen up!
    Repeat after me the following rules!${prompt}
  8908: Though I'm not one to really follow the rules, I guess it's good that one of us knows them...${prompt}
  8909: An exquisite display of force, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  8910: It was as if I were watching a battle fought by the Dragon King himself!${prompt}
  8911: Great job out there, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  8912: The dodging and slicing and dashing and slicing. I couldn't have done better myself!${prompt}
  8913: |-
    Excellent work, soldier! The president was pleased to hear of our victory!
    But do not think that the enemy will take their defeat lightly. They will be back, and they will win unless you stop them!${prompt}
  8914: |-
    Now get back out there, soldier!
    Do you want to live forever!?${prompt}
  8915: |-
    Unthinkable...
    A loss to those wretched Tarutaru and their pet kittens.${prompt}
  8916: If our forces cannot even defeat those cowards, then there is no future for our kingdom. I expect more from you in the next match, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  8917: |-
    I cannot believe what I am hearing...
    A loss to those uneducated Humes and their brainless Galka pets...${prompt}
  8918: Another defeat at the hands of those materialistic fiends will surely spell disaster for the future of our kingdom. I expect more from you in the next match, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  8919: You lost to those arrogant ignoramuses!? How could you lose to those arrogant...${prompt}
  8920: |-
    Ahem!
    Don't let it happen again, ${name-player}! You'rrre making me look bad!${prompt}
  8921: |-
    Hissssss!
    You couldn't even beat Bastok? You couldn't even beat...${prompt}
  8922: |-
    Ahem!
    Don't let it happen again, ${name-player}, or I'll scrrratch one of your eyes out!${prompt}
  8923: |-
    Defeat is an unavoidable aspect of battle!
    What separates the true victors from the losers lies in how the defeated handle their loss!${prompt}
  8924: |-
    Why did you fail!?
    What did you do wrong!?
    And how are you going to make sure these things don't happen in the next battle!?
    Do not make me repeat these words, ${name-player}! Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  8925: |-
    Defeat is an unavoidable aspect of battle!
    You suffered the pain of failure because you were outmatched!
    But remember, soldier, pain is only in your mind!${prompt}
  8926: |-
    Why did you fail!?
    What did you do wrong!?
    And how are you going to make sure these things don't happen in the next battle!?
    Know yourself and your enemy, and you will win! Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  8927: I must have underestimated the skill of our rival nation's forces...${prompt}
  8928: Ha ha! We must consider ourselves lucky to have found such a worthy opponent. However, next time I can assure you San d'Oria will have the upper hand!${prompt}
  8929: |-
    A draw!
    A draw is worse than being defeated, soldier! It means both forces didn't have what it takes to be a winner!${prompt}
  8930: |-
    You're lucky Ballista is just an exercise, because if this were the real thing, you'd be lying dead in the mud! Now get back out there and don't let this happen again!
    Dismissed!${prompt}
  8931: So close, yet so farrr...${prompt}
  8932: Tell me we're closer than farrrer, right?${prompt}
  8933: 'You wish to know about the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}? Yes, this device can be of great assistance on the battlefield.${prompt}'
  8934: While wearing it, you will be able to hear the orders of our nation's Pursuivant. His advice should aid you in battle.${prompt}
  8935: You will also have the opportunity to obtain details of upcoming matches while visiting any of the four nations.${prompt}
  8936: |-
    You want to see this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}? Here, take a look.
    These things arrre pretty useful. I often worrre one back when I was a pro.${prompt}
  8937: When you have it on, you'll be able to hearrr orders from Windurst's Pursuivant. He'll tell you what to do when you'rrre in a pinch.${prompt}
  8938: He'll also give you important info on upcoming matches when you'rrre in any of the four nations.${prompt}
  8939: |-
    Listen up, soldier!
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]} will not guarantee you victory, but it can make the difference in a close battle!${prompt}
  8940: In the heat of combat, soldiers can become disoriented! This earring will relay commands from Bastok's Pursuivant to you. You listen to him, you'll live! You don't, you won't!${prompt}
  8941: And if you're lucky, he just may give you valuable data on the upcoming matches while your back in the barracks!${prompt}
  8942: |-
    Ask for an earring?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  8943: A wise decision, ${name-player}. May the words of the Pursuivant guide you and our kingdom to victory.${prompt}
  8944: |-
    Here, let me put it on for you.
    Hmmm...
    You look great!
    Now there's nothing that can stop Windurst!${prompt}
  8945: |-
    Smart move, soldier!
    Now if you fall in battle, you will have no one to blame but yourself!${prompt}
  8946: I see. Well, I cannot force you to wear one.${prompt}
  8947: Well, if you think that you don't need one...${prompt}
  8948: If you think you've got what it takes to win without an earring, then I won't force you to wear one! However, don't come crying to me if you want one later!${prompt}
  8949: 'What is this? Perhaps you no longer require the assistance of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  8950: 'How''s the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} worrrking? Or maybe you don''t need it anymore. I could always take it off your hands.${prompt}'
  8951: 'Is there something wrong with your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!?${prompt}'
  8952: |-
    Return the earring?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    Not yet.${prompt}
  8953: Ah, so you are ready to stand on your own two feet. I wish all the best in your further matches.${prompt}
  8954: Really? But it looked so good on you... Oh well, if you ever need another, you know where I am.${prompt}
  8955: |-
    Well, it's about time!
    I was beginning to wonder when you'd let go of mommy's hand and start to walk on your own!
    Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  8956: |-
    What is this?
    I have no interest in chatting with a lowly member of the Federation. Why don't you return to your petty nation and frolic with your feline friends?${prompt}
  8957: |-
    ???
    If you haven't noticed, this is not San d'Oria. If you want to sign up for Conflict, I suggest you head back to Ronfaure.${prompt}
  8958: |-
    Does this look like Windurst, maggot!?
    If you do not leave these premises in ten seconds, I will be inclined to use force!
    Move! Move! Move!${prompt}
  8959: |-
    What is this?
    I have no interest in chatting with a lowly member of the Republic. If you do not leave immediately, I'll be forced to call the Temple Knights and have you arrested for impiety to the crown!${prompt}
  8960: |-
    Are you talking to me?
    Are you talking to me?
    Well, you can keep talking, but don't think I'll be listening. I don't have any business with a Bastoker.${prompt}
  8961: |-
    What is that smell!?
    Why, it's a San d'Orian adventurer!
    If you have the time to waste talking to me, you should be out thinking of a way to overthrow that crazy family that is denying your country its freedoms!${prompt}
  8962: |-
    Ah, I see that you were successful in receiving your license...
    I look forward to seeing you on the battlefield.${prompt}
  8963: Well, well, well! They even gave you a license. Your country must be really desperate...${prompt}
  8964: |-
    Where did you find that license, soldier!? It is against IRNC law to be in possession another soldier's documentation!
    What!? That is your license!? Ha! Ha! Ha!${prompt}
  8965: Ah, so you are applying to participate in the Conflict?${prompt}
  8966: |-
    You may proceed to the chateau and meet with King Destin. The royaulais is in his chambers.
    However, if I hear of any tomfoolery, I will personally behead you and present your skull to the Heralds for use in Ballista.${prompt}
  8967: |-
    Wait, don't tell me...
    You'rrre applying for participation in Conflict!?
    (Hah! A few more players like this and Windurst is guarrranteed victory!)${prompt}
  8968: |-
    Oh, I'm sorry, did you hearrr that?
    Well, never mind. You see that cute Tarutaru, Kupipi, over there? You just talk to her and she'll take you to the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  8969: |-
    So this is the type of garbage the other two nations are enlisting!?
    It makes me sick to see San d'Oria and Windurst not take these exercises seriously!${prompt}
  8970: I wouldn't think that the president would give scum like you approval to participate in the Conflict, but your appointment has already been made. Now move it!${prompt}
  8971: What is that? A letter from that rat, Ginuva? Hand it over!${prompt}
  8972: |-
    .........
    How dare he even think of mentioning the Second Battle of Konschtat!${prompt}
  8973: |-
    You!
    Tell your commander that I accept his challenge, and that this time history shall not repeat itself!${prompt}
  8974: A letter from Bastok? Here, let me see that...${prompt}
  8975: |-
    .........
    Grrrrrr! The nerrrve of that Galka... Did he think that after sending such a letter, I'd send you back to your nation in anything less than a body bag!?${prompt}
  8976: Hm? You had no idea of what was in the letter? Well, then you take this message back to your precious Broken Shield--tell that old bloke that I'll show him the quickest path to rrreincarnation!${prompt}
  8977: What is this!? A letter from that punk, Excenmille!?${prompt}
  8978: |-
    .........
    If he thinks that I...${prompt}
  8979: |-
    You!
    You tell that good-for-nothing commander of yours that youth won't protect him from the back of my axe!
    Now get out of my face!!!${prompt}
  8980: A letter from a Federation Mercenary Captain? Hand it over!${prompt}
  8981: |-
    .........
    I am useless and I should have stayed in the Northlands to rot... Preposterous!${prompt}
  8982: |-
    You!
    Tell your mercenary commander that I accept her petty challenge! Her pathetic claws will not even dent my armor!${prompt}
  8983: A letter from Lord Excenmille? And it's not even my birthday!${prompt}
  8984: |-
    .........
    Grrrrrr! What does he mean, amateurrr!? Ballista's a game, and I was the best! Battle experrrience has nothing to do with anything!${prompt}
  8985: |-
    You!
    You tell that pompous pighead that twenty yearrrs of playing in the snow with the Orcs won't help him in Conflict! My merrrcenaries will be all over him in a second!${prompt}
  8986: |-
    What is that you have there, maggot!?
    A shopping list from your mommy!?${prompt}
  8987: |-

    Th...vixen...sh...I...ki...${prompt}

  9043: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  9044: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  9045: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  9046: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  9047: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  9048: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  9049: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  9050: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  9051: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  9052: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  9053: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  9054: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  9055: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  9056: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  9057: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  9058: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  9059: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  9060: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  9061: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  9062: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  9063: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  9064: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  9065: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'

  9068: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  9069: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}

  9094: In Windurstian weddings, there's a custom-wustom known as the “Oath of Blood and Flesh.” Sounds scary, but it's actually rather touching. The couple-to-be presentaru each other with food, you see, and after that, wedding ringy-wings are exchanged.${prompt}

    Planning a trip to Abyssea, I gather?

  9183: First and foremost, it's the key by which one gains entry to Abyssea.${prompt}
  9184: Secondly, it serves as an anchor that secures one's essence to foreign dimensions.${prompt}
  9185: 'A single stone is good for a ${number: 1}-minute (Earth time) jaunt in Abyssea, and up to ${number: 2} can be in your possession at any given time. Multiplying those two numbers will give you the limit of your stay.${prompt}'

    Why, is that not ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} already in your posssesion?
    You need only insert that into a martello to initiate replenishment.${prompt}

    I see that you currently possess ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.

    Excellent. I would be especially appreciative if you could upgrade those martellos in distant locations--the quicker the better.

    So, what's a martello?
    Martello replenishment.
    Martello upgrades.
    Cautionary notes.
    Not now.${prompt}
  9233: |-
    The device we know as the martello was first developed by military engineers many years past, during an age of great war.
    Martellos serve to keep combatants fighting fit, healing their wounds and restoring their mental energies.${prompt}
  9234: You will observe that martellos have been constructed in numerous locales, so as to provide strategically located safe havens for harried resistance fighters. No doubt you will find yourself making use of them as well.${prompt}
  9235: In the bowels of each martello is contained a tank designed to hold martello fuel.${prompt}
  9236: |-
    This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is the lifeblood of the martello, and the source of its curative powers.
    Depleted stores will render the device little more than an oversized parchmentweight.${prompt}
  9237: That being the case, we're in continual need of volunteers willing to take on the vital task of replenishing these martellos.${prompt}
  9238: |-
    I have been charged with overseeing a supply of martello fuel.
    Should you be willing to take part in a replenishment run, you need only say the word.
    Needless to say, you will not go unrewarded for your efforts.${prompt}
  9239: |-
    Feast your eyes on this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. She's a beauty, isn't she?
    Installing one of these into a martello will increase its fuel capacity.${prompt}
  9240: |-
    An upgraded martello will be able to sustain its energy stores for a longer time between replenishment operations.
    Needless to say, this is a blessing and a half to those on the battlefield.${prompt}
  9241: |-
    Unfortunately, the installation procedure is quite complex.
    As such, we can only entrust it to experienced hands.${prompt}
  9242: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} are quite large and unwieldy.
    Even the burliest among us would be unable to carry one and ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} at the same time.${prompt}

  9367: The lovely Sheelala, and the merchant Habida-Jubida. They should be around still.${prompt}
  9368: I need you to ask a～ll three Tarutaru who were here that day.${prompt}
  9369: 'They should be on the first floor of Heavens Tower: Sassa-Kotassa, Sheelala, and Habida-Jubida.${prompt}'
  9370: They were present the who～le time and certainly would have picked up on something.${prompt}
  9371: You say that Shantotto is accusing Kupipi of dereliction of duty!?${prompt}
  9372: Hmmm...I remember there were some Yagudo here that day on some business or other... Oops! I'm not supposed to talk about that!${prompt}
  9373: But...my memory of anything else that day is really hazy. I wonder why that is.${prompt}
  9374: 'Oh, that''s right! Red cloth! ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!${prompt}'
  9375: This is getting even more peculiar. Why would I suddenly recall that?${prompt}
  9376: 'How curious. Well, you''re an adventurer, so getting your hands on ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} should be easy. Why don''t you bring one to me?${prompt}'
  9377: That should certainly help jog my memory. I'm sure of it!${prompt}
  9378: 'I''m sure ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} would help jog my memory!${prompt}'
  9379: Make sure to come back if you get your hands on one.${prompt}
  9380: That's right! It's all coming back to me now!${prompt}
  9381: 'The Yagudo messengers who came that day were wearing garb made of ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  9382: O-oh no! I forgot that I wasn't supposed to mention the Yagudo!${prompt}
  9383: And you're more concerned with Doctor Shantotto anyway. Right.${prompt}
  9384: She did, in fact, come that day, asking Kupipi to help her out with her old attire.${prompt}
  9385: Kupipi was in a bit of a tizzy over it. The outfit was practically in tatters, covered in grime and riddled with holes.${prompt}
  9386: It's not like her to forget something like that. Perhaps her breakfast didn't agree with her.${prompt}
  9387: Doctor Shantotto did, in fact, come that day, asking Kupipi to help her out with her old attire.${prompt}
  9388: Kupipi was in a bit of a tizzy over it. The outfit was practically in tatters, covered in grime and riddled with holes.${prompt}
  9389: I've never seen Doctor Shantotto so furious before.${prompt}
  9390: Perhaps Kupipi's flame has burned out at last.${prompt}
  9391: But just between you and me...I don't recall much about that day, either.${prompt}
  9392: Shantotto wasn't the only one with an axe to grind that day. Everyone was on edge because of other guests we had.${prompt}
  9393: 'I was tasked with bringing ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to the tower to appease our non-Tarutaru visitors.${prompt}'
  9394: 'Maybe I could remember more if you brought me ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  9395: It would really be a big help. Please return with one at your earliest convenience.${prompt}
  9396: 'On the day in question, the higher-ups asked me to procure ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for some very special guests.${prompt}'
  9397: Maybe I could remember more if you brought me one.${prompt}
  9398: Thank you for your assistance. I do seem to remember more now...${prompt}
  9399: That morning I crossed paths with Doctor Shantotto, and she seemed to be in a bit of a funk.${prompt}
  9400: 'She was visibly frustrated that Kupipi wouldn''t share some of the highest-quality ${item-plural: 2[2]} that were just delivered directly from the farms.${prompt}'
  9401: You know how much Kupipi loves rolanberries--but she of all people would realize the headaches that turning down Doctor Shantotto's request would cause.${prompt}
  9402: Perhaps the verbal tit-for-tat they had about the rolanberries caused Kupipi to forget about Doctor Shantotto's outfit.${prompt}
  9403: Or maybe she was just hopped up on rolanberries. Who can say, really?${prompt}
  9404: 'And about the ${item-singular: 1[2]} I procured that day...${prompt}'
  9405: If memory serves, the Yagudo sent one more messenger than we were expecting, which is why I had to rush to find more refreshments. But how could I forget that?${prompt}
  9406: I must be more tired than usual. Don't mind me.${prompt}
  9407: Kupipi may have had nothing but rolanberries on the mind the day that Doctor Shantotto came.${prompt}
  9408: Perhaps that's the reason she forgot all about the good doctor's request for assistance with her outfit.${prompt}
  9409: Yes, yes, you're here about that spat between Kupipi and Doctor Shantotto.${prompt}
  9410: I've known Kupipi since we both were tots, and I really would like to take her side, but...${prompt}
  9411: '...to be frank, I don''t remember that day very clearly.${prompt}'
  9412: It's like the entire day is shrouded in a thick fog.${prompt}
  9413: The only thing that even vaguely comes to mind is someone asking me questions about magicked homunculi.${prompt}
  9414: Something about homunculi being sealed deep within the tower...it was straight out of some campfire story told to scare children.${prompt}
  9415: What's particularly strange is that while I can recall the details of the conversation, I haven't the faintest recollection of who I was talking to!${prompt}
  9416: 'For some reason, I keep seeing this image of ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} in my mind.${prompt}'
  9417: Maybe it's the key to this entire mystery.${prompt}
  9418: Well, to my mystery, anyway. Not sure about yours.${prompt}
  9419: 'Could you bring me ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}? Maybe it''ll help me conjure up some more details about that day.${prompt}'
  9420: Perhaps I can conjure up some more details about that day.${prompt}
  9421: I was talking with someone about the Cardians...but I can't remember who.${prompt}
  9422: 'Maybe ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} holds the key to this mystery.${prompt}'
  9423: 'Ah, yes. The lovely scent of ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  9424: I remember now! The Yagudo!${prompt}
  9425: The Yagudo sent some secret messenger here to Heavens Tower!${prompt}
  9426: All nonessential personnel were told to leave the tower while they were here, but I had a special delivery for Kupipi and Sheelala that absolutely could not wait.${prompt}
  9427: I ran into Doctor Shantotto after I dropped off my charge.${prompt}
  9428: She said that she needed to shed a little bit of weight to fit into an old outfit, and asked me for a special item...${prompt}
  9429: '...and now that I think of it, she also told me three times not to tell anyone that she was getting a touch more rotund.${prompt}'
  9430: Ahem. The dents in Doctor Shantotto's scale aside, it was clear that she was not in the best of spirits.${prompt}
  9431: Perhaps Kupipi was so flustered by Doctor Shantotto's attitude that she simply forgot.${prompt}
  9432: But Doctor Shantotto would never admit that perhaps she was part of the problem.${prompt}
  9433: Perhaps the only thing Kupipi can do now is get on her hands and knees and beg for forgiveness.${prompt}
  9434: As for me, I'll do what I can to run interference.${prompt}
  9435: I know that Doctor Shantotto is partially at fault, but she would never see it that way.${prompt}
  9436: I'll try to keep the peace. Try to gently break it to Kupipi that she may have to eat crow.${prompt}
  9437: So? Were you able to get to the bo～ttom of things?${prompt}
  9438: So, let me summarize a～ll the information you gathered.${prompt}
  9439: 'On the day in question, I was ve～ry excited about a fresh delivery of ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  9440: But I also had to sew and clean Doctor Shantotto's old outfit, which was both dirty and in a state of disrepair.${prompt}
  9441: But it's unclear which one of us is tru～ly at fault.${prompt}
  9442: And either way, the quickest way to smooth things over would be to apologize.${prompt}
  9443: Apologize? Me? She's not the o～nly one angry!${prompt}
  9444: No one told me anything about ro～lanberries!${prompt}
  9445: 'If they did, I would be munching on ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} at this very moment!${prompt}'
  9446: My dear adve～nturer friend, I have but one more request before I leave you for the great beyond.${prompt}
  9447: 'Perhaps my spirit will be at rest if I have one last parting ${item-singular: 2[2]} before I expire.${prompt}'
  9448: At least my la～st meal will have been a good one...${prompt}
  9449: I'm comple～tely frazzled by this entire situation.${prompt}
  9450: 'Maybe ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} from the Rolanberry Fields will calm my nerves.${prompt}'
  9451: If this is to be my la～st day on Vana'diel, at least let me go out happy...${prompt}
  9452: 'Oh, bless you for bri～nging me this ${item-singular: 2[2]}...${prompt}'
  9453: 'Oh, bless you for bri～nging me this ${item-singular: 2[2]}...${prompt}'
  9454: 'Wait...is this...could it be...${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}!?${prompt}'
  9455: (Munch, munch, munch...)
  9456: Oh, this is po～sitively delightful! Perhaps the last few moments of my life were the happiest!${prompt}
  9457: Oh, this is po～sitively delightful! This flavor and aroma will stay with me even into the afterlife!${prompt}
  9458: Aaah!
  9459: I remember! I remember e～verything!${prompt}
  9460: Yagudo messengers were visiting Heavens Tower that day, and the entire place was aflutter with activity.${prompt}
  9461: There was a huge frenzy about the peace treaty with the Yagudo. I can't go into too much detail, but we were incre～dibly busy that day.${prompt}
  9462: You see, Windurst and the Yagudo had signed a peace treaty upon the conclusion of the war. While we had la～rgely agreed to the main conditions, there were still a few kinks left to work out.${prompt}
  9463: Of course, actually letting Yagudo into Windurst proved a task and a half.${prompt}
  9464: You can ima～gine the chaos rippling through the townsfolk if they knew about this meeting.${prompt}
  9465: We had to keep the whole thing under wraps--although I guess your inve～stigation dug up some of the details.${prompt}
  9466: Doctor Shantotto burst onto the scene right as we were at our most busy.${prompt}
  9467: She whipped out the most disheveled outfit I had e～ver seen. It was postively filthy, and not even a Goblin would be caught dead in it.${prompt}
  9468: 'Tha～nkfully, there was a merchant on the first floor who had just delivered some fresh ${item-plural: 2[2]}. I asked him to take it to the tailor''s for me.${prompt}'
  9469: And you know what I told him?${prompt}
  9470: “Tell the tailor to deliver it to Doctor Shantotto once it's ready!”${prompt}
  9471: But...${prompt}
  9472: But I was positively fa～mished, and my cheeks may or may not have been stuffed with rolanberries...${prompt}
  9473: They were positively bursting at the seams. Like this!${prompt}
  9474: And what I a～ctually said may have come more across as “Mmmf mmmf mmmf mmmf mmmf!”${prompt}
  9475: This is why one should ne～ver talk with their mouth full...${prompt}
  9476: 'But this ${item-singular: 2[2]}...its true flavor defies all words.${prompt}'
  9477: '...And it tells no lies.${prompt}'
  9478: Can you...can you please go tell Doctor Shantotto what happened?${prompt}
  9479: In the meantime, I'll try to find the right words for a pro～per apology.${prompt}
  9480: Oh! That reminds me to report back to Verena.${prompt}
  9481: 'She''ll be interested in hearing about the “fi～nal illusion” I saw with the ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  9482: 'Ah, the true flavor of ${item-plural: 2[2]}...${prompt}'
  9483: Please repo～rt back to Shantotto for me, will you?${prompt}
  9484: N-no! I can't believe that it's all Kupipi's fault!${prompt}
  9485: Maybe I should go consult with Zubaba or Semih Lafihna.${prompt}
  9486: Although when it comes to Doctor Shantotto, I suppose there's nothing that anyone can do...${prompt}
  9487: Well, this does leave Kupipi in a bit of a pickle.${prompt}
  9488: It doesn't take a trip to the Star Spring to see the fire and brimstone that wait in Kupipi's future.${prompt}
  9489: Even though we now know the truth...I can't say that it changes much.${prompt}
  9490: Don't worry about Shantotto--I'll try to quell her rage with a delivery that'll smooth things over.${prompt}
  9491: What? What is it now? Can't you see that I'm ve～ry busy!?${prompt}
  9492: There is a secret chamber here in Hea～vens Tower.${prompt}
  9493: It's only got one entrance, protected and locked by a ma～gical rune...${prompt}
  9494: And King of Spades, the Cardian charged with guarding it, has gone mi～ssing!${prompt}
  9495: Of course, I'm not supposed to sha～re that with you.${prompt}
  9496: So then why did I?${prompt}
  9497: Well, I'm in a little bit of a bind, and I'm afrai～d that I need your help.${prompt}
  9498: You see, we sealed something incre～dibly important deep within its innermost recesses.${prompt}
  9499: Something taboo according to Windurstian custom...but that we were unable to get rid of or destroy.${prompt}
  9500: And I want to check and make su～re that it's in its rightful place...${prompt}
  9501: But only King of Spades has the key, and he's no～where to be found!${prompt}
  9502: Perhaps more accurately, it's not that he ha～s the key, but rather he is the key.${prompt}
  9503: Hm? You want to know the name of the thing we've sealed away in that room?${prompt}
  9504: |-
    Are you interested?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure.
    Not really.
    I didn't say a word...${prompt}
  9505: Hehe...you're sure to be surpri～sed!${prompt}
  9506: Hehe...you're sure to be really surpri～sed!${prompt}
  9507: We call it...the Do～ll Chamber!!!${prompt}
  9508: Even the name makes me qui～ver in my boots! Could the legends be true? Could they!?${prompt}
  9509: But there's something else...${prompt}
  9510: Something that sca～res me more than any magicked creature ever could...${prompt}
  9511: And that's the pent-up rage Doctor Shantotto must be feeling because I ha～ven't gone to apologize yet!${prompt}
  9512: O-oh no! You have a message from her? Heavens...${prompt}
  9513: You mean...I don't have to go to the great beyond!? Hurray!${prompt}
  9514: I'm plea～sed as punch that Doctor Shantotto has seen that there's too much strange stuff going on to hold a grudge.${prompt}
  9515: None of it makes a～ny sense. Not just my memory going all fuzzy...${prompt}
  9516: '...but King of Spades going missing. It must a～ll be connected to whatever great evil she senses.${prompt}'
  9517: I think our next order of business should be to talk to the people on the first floor of Heavens Tower and see if they have any lead on Ki～ng of Spades.${prompt}
  9518: They should be cooperative if you mention that I filled you in.${prompt}
  9519: I think Doctor Shantotto has the ri～ght of it. Everyone's memory loss is a sign of worse things to come.${prompt}
  9520: We might be able to get to the bottom of things if you find the missing King of Spades.${prompt}
  9521: Consult with the people on the first floor of Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  9522: Wh-what!? Kupipi shared that super-secret...secret with you!?${prompt}
  9523: Well...I guess it's fine if she trusts you, but please don't go around Vana'diel flapping your lips about it.${prompt}
  9524: I've heard that a Cardian was spotted heading toward East Sarutabaruta, although no one seems to know why.${prompt}
  9525: Ah, so you think Shantotto will calm down a touch if we find King of Spades?${prompt}
  9526: If you and Kupipi think that's best, then I shall lend my aid.${prompt}
  9527: I would wager that you'd find answers at a magic tower. But I couldn't specifically say which one.${prompt}
  9528: Yes, yes, I've heard all about how Doctor Shantotto will forgive Kupipi if she can get to the bottom of things.${prompt}
  9529: I see. You're looking for the missing Cardian to help save Kupipi's skin.${prompt}
  9530: It's not like a Cardian to just up and disobey orders. And to leave the city, at that? It boggles the mind.${prompt}
  9531: Something may be threatening the Cardian, or otherwise have a nefarious plan in mind. I would prepare for battle if I were you.${prompt}
  9532: Oh no! King of Spades is back--but something's wrong!${prompt}
  9533: They're talking all weird and they seem to be a little beat up!${prompt}
  9534: Well, isn't it a good thing that King of Spades is back? That should help Doctor Shantotto to simmer down.${prompt}
  9535: I wish I could say this was a happy ending, but the world is never so simple.${prompt}
  9536: Everyone is abuzz about King of Spades and how strong they are.${prompt}
  9537: But all those Yagudo feathers... It can only mean one thing.${prompt}
  9538: We～lcome back!　I was waiting for your arrival with bated breath!${prompt}
  9539: Thank you so mu～ch for helping to find King of Spades!${prompt}
  9540: His magical energies were all misali～gned, and there's no telling what might have happened if he didn't come back for repairs.${prompt}
  9541: I'm not the least bit surprised. He was fighting the Yagu～do for so long. It would take the wind out of anyone's sails.${prompt}
  9542: But we did learn something ve～ry important from his report.${prompt}
  9543: I can't believe something so important was just sto～len from the Doll Chamber--especially when it was made by such a storied mage...${prompt}
  9544: Eeek! I'm fa～r too scared to say anything else!${prompt}
  9545: I'm more scared of those sweet-peety-weets you made the other day, Kupipi.${prompt}
  9546: Professor Koru-Moru!
  9547: |-
    I, on the other hand, have nothing to fear.
    When others are bawling, I shed not a tear.${prompt}
  9548: And Doctor Shantotto, too!
  9549: |-
    Sorry it took us so long.
    We had to make sure nothing went wrong.${prompt}
  9550: |-
    Now, please tell us what happened and spare no detail.
    We must know the truth, thought it may make Kupipi's face go pale.${prompt}
  9551: |-
    We know King of Spades left and returned all beaten up.
    Usually Cardians can fulfill their duty without a hiccup.${prompt}
  9552: |-
    So they stole something of value from the Doll Chamber.
    No wonder Kupipi was in a tizzy. Could you blame her?${prompt}
  9553: I think we both know what this means-weans, Doctor Shantotto.${prompt}
  9554: |-
    At first I thought someone wanted to just invoke my ire.
    But we're out of the kitchen and into the fire.${prompt}
  9555: |-
    But to use such memory-altering magics is quite the ordeal.
    They must have desired to make sure Windurst was brought to heel.${prompt}
  9556: |-
    Yes, their goal in using them was just to bide time.
    If we had noticed earlier, their punishment would have been divine.${prompt}
  9557: But madiddly-magic that causes people to forget things doesn't work on Cardians.${prompt}
  9558: Obviously because they are made of magic themselves.${prompt}
  9559: |-
    They knew we would be onto them. That much is certain.
    So they used the Yagudo and manipulated things from behind the curtain.${prompt}
  9560: And it's never-schmever easy to get the better of a Cardian with the rank of king.${prompt}
  9561: They wanted the Cardian to fight-diddly-ight the Yagudo...or were just using them as a decoy.${prompt}
  9562: W-wait. So the Yagudo stole that horri～fic magicked doll...${prompt}
  9563: And were the big bads who threatened me and everyone else?${prompt}
  9564: |-
    Kupipi, my dear, were you even listening?
    If it were really that simple, the hairs on my head would be bristling.${prompt}
  9565: I-I-I don't get it...${prompt}
  9566: We can only thinkiddy-theorize as to who was pulling the strings.${prompt}
  9567: Perhaps we'll just have to wait-diddly-ait until the memory-altering magic finally fully wears off!${prompt}
  9568: |-
    Indeed. Now let me get out of this minister's garb.
    Mu normal outfit is much better for hurling barbs.${prompt}
  9569: Kupipi!${prompt}
  9570: Y-yes?${prompt}
  9571: |-
    I think that you've done all that you can.
    Now go get some rest--or perhaps maybe a tan.${prompt}
  9572: D-does this mean...you've forgi～ven me?${prompt}
  9573: Why, I'm so exci～ted I could positively burst!${prompt}
  9574: |-
    And you, my detective, have also earned a rest.
    Though there's still much to discover, I know you did your best.${prompt}
  9575: |-
    But when we find the evil forces behind this incident,
    I'll have you fight by my side--thrilling, isn't it?${prompt}
  9576: |-
    I think you would make a fabulous decoy!
    You stand there, looking pretty, as my enemies I destroy!
    Ohohoho!${prompt}
  9577: I rea～lly wish that Doctor Shantotto wouldn't speak in riddles and then disappear without further explanation.${prompt}
  9578: If the Yagudo weren't behind a～ll this, then who was?${prompt}
  9579: I know you agree with me, my dete～ctive companion!${prompt}
  9580: |-
    Are the Yagudo behind this?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    Probably not.${prompt}
  9581: See? There's absolu～tely no one else we know to be involved!${prompt}
  9582: B-but then who? We don't have even the sli～ghtest inkling of anyone else's involvement.${prompt}
  9583: Kupipi, whateverrr are you talking about with ${name-player}?${prompt}
  9584: Kupipi, whateverrr are you talking about with that adventurer?${prompt}
  9585: Ah, Semih Lafihna! Well, it has to do with the you-know-what...${prompt}
  9586: Ah, so the “outsiderrr” you were having assist you was ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9587: Ah, so the “outsiderrr” you were having assist you was this adventurer.${prompt}
  9588: You of all people should know that you could be punished severrrely for having someone from outside the tower's hierarchy assist you in matters that demand the utmost secrecy.${prompt}
  9589: W-will I really be punished?${prompt}
  9590: But if Star Sibyl were aware of how angrrry Shantotto was...you might be in the clear.${prompt}
  9591: She is nothing if not kind and benevolent. Surely her largesse knows no bounds.${prompt}
  9592: W-will Star Sibyl really punish me?${prompt}
  9593: She knows how angrrry Shantotto was...and said that she forgives you.${prompt}
  9594: She is gra～cious and understanding, as always.${prompt}
  9595: Our firrrst priority is to get that doll back.${prompt}
  9596: The seemingly easiest way would be to interrrogate the Yagudo involved...${prompt}
  9597: '...but the peace treaty is in jeopardy as it is. We simply can''t take the rrrisk.${prompt}'
  9598: '...but sticking our nose in may thrrreaten the peace treaty that we worked so hard to sign.${prompt}'
  9599: Windurst has always endeavored to find peace.${prompt}
  9600: But most of all, we need to be e～xtra careful around Doctor Shantotto and Professor Koru-Moru.${prompt}
  9601: If she gets so much as a whiff of the big bad, she'll blow e～verything and e～veryone to smithereens.${prompt}
  9602: A move that would surprrrise no one, to be sure. I think we need to gather all the ministers and people of power in Windurst and have them come up with a plan.${prompt}
  9603: Of course, it will likely take them eons to decide anything as they deliberate back and forth for weeks on end...${prompt}
  9604: A move that would surprrrise no one, to be sure. I think we need to gather all the ministers and people of power in Windurst and have them come up with a plan.${prompt}
  9605: And of course, we'll have to abide by whateverrr decision Star Sibyl makes.${prompt}
  9606: I suppose that makes sense!${prompt}
  9607: Then I'll prepare a star-crested summons right away!${prompt}
  9608: ${name-player}, you've alrrready fought the Yagudo supposedly involved, yes?${prompt}
  9609: Adventurer, you've alrrready fought the Yagudo supposedly involved, yes?${prompt}
  9610: Worrry not. I'm not going to blame you, only use your experience to make things go a touch more smoothly.${prompt}
  9611: 'You are an adventurerrr, ${choice: 1}[so we''ll set things up so that when you dig deep into the matter, no one will find out your connection with Windurst./so no one will think of you as a representative of Windurst as you proceed with your investigation.]${prompt}'
  9612: I cannot shout this from the rooftops, but the item that was stolen inspires fear in even the most stalwart of Windurstians.${prompt}
  9613: So much, in fact, that it might impede them from seeing things clearrrly.${prompt}
  9614: Your first step should be to speak with Tosuka-Porika in the Optistery. He can prrrovide you with all the details you need.${prompt}
  9615: Semih Lafihna! I've prepared the star-crested summons!${prompt}
  9616: Thank you, Kupipi. Can you please give one to ${name-player}?${prompt}
  9617: Thank you, Kupipi. Can you please give one to our adventurer friend?${prompt}
  9618: I hereby entrrrust you with the task of delivering this summons to Tosuka-Porika of the Optistery.${prompt}
  9619: Remember, this is incredibly important! Please do not lo～se it!${prompt}
  9620: Don't forget the incredibly important task Semih Lafihna has given you!${prompt}
  9621: 'Deliver the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} to Tosuka-Porika in the Optistery, located in Windurst Waters.${prompt}'
  9622: I rea～lly wish that Doctor Shantotto wouldn't speak in riddles and then disappear without furhter explanation.${prompt}
  9623: If the Yagudo weren't behind a～ll this, then who was?${prompt}
  9624: Rea～lly!? You got back the doll that the Yagudo stole?${prompt}
  9625: Thank you so ve～ry much!${prompt}
  9626: I've had to walk on pins and needles around Semih Lafihna this whole time.${prompt}
  9627: Maybe now Semih Lafihna and the Star Sibyl won't shake their heads at me every time I show my face.${prompt}
  9628: But I don't want to touch the accu～rsed thing for even one moment more than I have to.${prompt}
  9629: Wait here while I go bring it upstairs.${prompt}
  9630: Hrm? What are you doing?${prompt}
  9631: 'I am here to give my sage advice to ${choice: 0}[everyone/the Star Sibyl].${prompt}'
  9632: But where on Vana'diel has Kupipi gone off to?${prompt}
  9633: Hrm? Hrmmm!? Well, that sounds like quite the adventure.${prompt}
  9634: I can't say that I'm surprised Honoi-Gomoi would be involved in such shady dealings.${prompt}
  9635: 'But since the sky hasn''t come crashing down on us, we can at least breathe easy that ${choice: 0}[the forbidden techniques/the Manustery''s techniques] weren''t employed.${prompt}'
  9636: Or maybe they were...and just failed to take effect.${prompt}
  9637: |-
    Hrm. Hrmmm...
    Hrmmmmmm!${prompt}
  9638: Whatever the case may be, it is high time that Honoi-Gomoi pay for his treachery.${prompt}
  9639: I wouldn't be so su～re.${prompt}
  9640: As soon as we try to bring him to task for his crimes, he starts complaining that no one has any concrete evidence to pin anything on him.${prompt}
  9641: Hrm. I suppose we would have trouble making charges stick. Circumstantial evidence only goes so far.${prompt}
  9642: And even when we do get him co～rnered, he just says “I'm so terribly sorry!” and donates a bunch of money to some destitute orphanage or something.${prompt}
  9643: Hrm. I suppose it depends on how far Doctor Shantotto wants to take things.${prompt}
  9644: I think we should probably keep this incident as far away from Shantotto as we can. She'd probably conjure forth a hellstorm that would burn down the enti～re city.${prompt}
  9645: That's a good point. The cure being worse than the illness and whatnot.${prompt}
  9646: And while we're on the subject, what did you do with the doll?${prompt}
  9647: Its magical energies appea～r to have completely sputtered out, and now it's just a raggedy old thing. I'll let you check it out for yourself later.${prompt}
  9648: Hrm... I was hoping it would at least sputter out a few words.${prompt}
  9649: And right when the last of its magic faltered, it said something in a really tiny voice. Do you remember hearing anything too, adventurer?${prompt}
  9650: |-
    Did it say anything?
    ${selection-lines}
    “Chaos”...
    Did it?${prompt}
  9651: “Caboose”!${prompt}
  9652: '...Or was it “Chaos”?${prompt}'
  9653: Hrm! Those are completely different things!${prompt}
  9654: “Chaos”...${prompt}
  9655: Isn't that name something that the Maelstrom Mage left in his notes?${prompt}
  9656: Hrm. Pay no attention to the rambling of an old man.${prompt}
  9657: This ce～rtainly puts us in a bit of a mental pickle.${prompt}
  9658: So stop talking to yourself and tell us what's going on! I've worked on this too hard to be left in the da～rk!${prompt}
  9659: Hrmmm! I think ${name-player} worked at least five times as hard as you.${prompt}
  9660: I shall bring this up before the other ministers, and perhaps can be convinced to let you know what course of action we decide upon. Hrm!${prompt}
  9661: “Hrm” indeed!${prompt}
  9662: |-
    Hrm.
    Hrmmm...
    Hrmmmmmm!${prompt}
  9663: And ${name-player}, allow me to give you this token in appreciation for your efforts.${prompt}
  9664: 'It''s ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Perhaps it will bring you good luck.${prompt}'
  9665: We came across it while investigating the eggs the Yagudo were after.${prompt}
  9666: And unfortunately, the one you came across wasn't what the Yagudo sought.${prompt}
  9667: Really!?${prompt}
  9668: What I wou～ldn't give to have seen the looks on their faces!${prompt}
  9669: The legendary egg they are looking for is no ordinary culinary treat. They are looking for the “World Eater Egg.”${prompt}
  9670: World Eater Egg!? I don't like the sou～nd of that!${prompt}
  9671: Hrm. The only thing I've come across so far is the name. This requires more research.${prompt}
  9672: I've got a ba～d feeling about this. And my bad feelings are usually right...mostly.${prompt}
  9673: I would like to discuss this further, but the other ministers await. Perhaps we can continue this discussion at a later date.${prompt}
  9674: And let's keep this incident just between us. We don't want to sow discord in the city.${prompt}
  9675: People around here are very sensitive to the word “Caboose.”${prompt}
  9676: I mean “Chaos”!
  9677: At least we've closed the door on one my～stery. So why are you all antsy?${prompt}
  9678: Oh, right. Because you forgot your reward. Here it is.${prompt}
