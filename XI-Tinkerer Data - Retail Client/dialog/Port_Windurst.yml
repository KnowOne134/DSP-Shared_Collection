    You want to make ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?

  3217: Bastok is surrounded by a mountain range and has many Galka living in it, so it seems to have the image of an untamed land.${prompt}
  3218: But there are romantic spots, such as the view of the drawbridge at sunset. If you are out to make sweet memories in Bastok, you can't go wrong in that area.${prompt}
  3219: Hiya! This is the Consulate of Bastok. It's a little piece of Bastok that's like an oasis in the midst of Windurst.${prompt}
  3220: Oh, it's not that I dislike Windurst. The beauty of this place is superb, with not a speck of dirt in sight.${prompt}
  3221: I guess that's because the Tarutaru line of vision is so close to the ground, that they don't let a single thing that's been dropped slip by them.${prompt}
  3222: Befaw the Great War, there weren't nawn of these here consulawtes. So whens yaw went to a fawreign country, yaw felt awl alone.${prompt}
  3223: I'm rooly jealous of travelers tawday. If anything happens to them, theys can just go to the nearest consulawte faw help.${prompt}
  3224: Oh, you have some business with Consul Melek? Then please head into her office through that door there.${prompt}
  3225: I am Melek, the consul of Bastok. I trust you had a safe sail here?${prompt}
  3226: So, you are ${name-player}...the one who accepted the cooperative mission to Windurst, I see?${prompt}
  3227: Well then, Gold Skull, why don't you start by informing our fair citizen here about what the mission involves?${prompt}
  3228: Allow me to explain...${prompt}
  3229: The mission from our comrades in Windurst entails the oblation of magic weapons to Giddeus, the frontline to the abode of the Yagudo beastmen.${prompt}
  3230: One of the magic weapons to be dedicated to Giddeus will be handed to you at Heavens Tower, here in Windurst.${prompt}
  3231: Your orders are to help carry those magical weapons to the Yagudo treasure chamber, deep beneath Giddeus.${prompt}
  3232: |-
    You look perplexed.
    Yes, well, I guess if you put it frankly, you are carrying a tribute to a pack of beastmen.${prompt}
  3233: You see...in order to maintain the peace of their country, the Windurstians have formed amicable relations with the Yagudo.${prompt}
  3234: But, as you've probably realized, it's hard to call their relationship amicable when you witness the outrageous behavior of the Yagudo.${prompt}
  3235: So we have to try to curtail the beastmen's military potential without losing the trust of Windurst.${prompt}
  3236: That's where your real purpose comes in. Gold Skull, please explain the rest of the mission...${prompt}
  3237: After receiving the magical weapons from Heavens Tower in the Windurst Walls district, you are to return here to the Consulate of Bastok and present the weapons to us.${prompt}
  3238: We will exchange these with a different weapon, which you will take to Giddeus as an offering instead.${prompt}
  3239: |-
    Do you understand your orders?
    Of course, the fact that we are switching weapons is to remain top secret.${prompt}
  3240: We are forbidden from meddling in the internal affairs of another country. However, we wish to save Windurst from its dangerous predicament.${prompt}
  3241: Well, you had better get going. I pray that your mission is a success.${prompt}
  3242: Ask Gold Skull for further explanation if you need clarification. I pray that your mission is a success.${prompt}
  3243: You are to proceed to Heavens Tower and obtain a shipment of magical weapons. Then you are to return back here to the Consulate of Bastok at once.${prompt}
  3244: |-
    Once we have switched the weapons, you are to head to Giddeus and offer them to the Yagudo.
    Dismissed!${prompt}
  3245: You're wondering what you should do if the Yagudo realize you switched weapons on them, aren't you?${prompt}
  3246: Well, that's where your abilities as an adventurer come into play. You should be able to think of something, shouldn't you?${prompt}
  3247: The real magical weapons will be shipped back to Bastok, where our soldiers will make far better use of them than the Yagudo ever would.${prompt}
  3248: Wait.${prompt}
  3249: |-
    Take this sword to Giddeus instead.
    Good luck.${prompt}
  3250: |-
    Take that sword to Giddeus.
    Good luck.${prompt}
  3251: |-
    Welcome back.
    Your mission went without incident, I trust?${prompt}
  3252: We've sent the real magic weapons like the one you brought us, back to our homeland. They'll come in useful for expelling the Quadav from around Bastok.${prompt}
  3253: Well, I presume you have to proceed to the Consulate of Bastok in San d'Oria next.${prompt}
  3254: It is another long journey to reach San d'Oria. You have to travel from Mhaura to Selbina by boat first, then follow the land route north for quite a way.${prompt}
  3255: Don't overdo yourself. Rest up a little before you head to your destination, San d'Oria.${prompt}
  3256: I hope to see you safe and well again someday. Take care, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  3257: To overdo yourself is to work beyond your natural abilities.${prompt}
  3258: Carrying on in such a way will not enable you to give good results. Sometimes you simply need to be kind to yourself.${prompt}
  3259: |-
    I constantly pray.
    I pray for the future of Bastok.${prompt}
  3260: Today I'll also be praying for you to have a safe journey.${prompt}
  3261: Those Yagudo didn't take the weapons shipment without giving you trouble, did they?${prompt}
  3262: But you were quick-witted and skilled enough to overcome it. That's the way of the true Bastoker.${prompt}
  3263: I wonder how long our countries will keep cheating on each other?${prompt}
  3264: This whole Yagudo thing got messy because the Windurstians tried to play nice with them...${prompt}
  3265: Both our country and Jeuno should tell them straight that this isn't going to get them anywhere.${prompt}
  3266: The Windurstians are just being used by the Yagudo.${prompt}
  3267: |-
    I am Melek, the consul of Bastok.
    I trust you had a safe sail here?${prompt}
  3268: |-
    So, you are ${name-player}...?
    I heard about your activities in San d'Oria and am expecting great things from you here too.${prompt}
  3269: Well then, we should get straight to the matter at hand. Gold Skull, why don't you start by informing our fair citizen here about what the mission involves?${prompt}
  3270: Allow me to explain...${prompt}
  3271: The mission from our comrades in Windurst entails the extermination of a giant monster that appeared in the depths of Giddeus, the borderland to the theocracy of the Yagudo beastmen.${prompt}
  3272: You are to receive a key from Heavens Tower in the Windurst Walls district, and head to the innermost part of Giddeus.${prompt}
  3273: Your orders are to then defeat the heinous beast that lurks there.${prompt}
  3274: |-
    You look perplexed.
    Yes, well, I guess if you put it frankly, you are protecting a pack of Yagudo beastmen from a ferocious monster.${prompt}
  3275: You see...in order to maintain the peace of their country, the Windurstians have formed amicable relations with the Yagudo.${prompt}
  3276: But, as you've probably realized, it's hard to call their relationship amicable when you witness the outrageous behavior of the Yagudo.${prompt}
  3277: But, in order to maintain the trust of Windurst, we have to participate in this preposterousness.${prompt}
  3278: Well, good luck with your mission. I look forward to hearing of your success.${prompt}
  3279: You are to receive a key from Heavens Tower, here in Windurst, and to defeat the great monster that has appeared in the depths of Giddeus. That's all your country requires from you.${prompt}
  3280: Just because the Windurstians are trying to be friends with the Yagudo doesn't mean we should hold back from continuing our fight with the beastmen.${prompt}
  3281: Go ahead and savage the brutes, I say! If Windurst puts forward an official complaint, I'll handle it for you.${prompt}
  3282: Ask Gold Skull for further explanation if you need clarification. I pray that your mission is a success.${prompt}
  3283: You wonder whether something can be done about the amicable relationships between Windurst and the Yagudo? I think it's a hopeless cause, personally.${prompt}
  3284: The Tarutaru are like puppets having their strings pulled in the name of “peace.” But then again, it is nice to have peace, even if it is only skin-deep.${prompt}
  3285: |-
    ...!
    The Shadow Lord...!?${prompt}
  3286: |-
    Wait a moment...
    I'll need you to rush back to the homeland.${prompt}
  3287: Here... You understand what you must do? Take this report to the President's Office in Bastok.${prompt}
  3288: |-
    On your way.
    Please hurry to Bastok!${prompt}
  3289: Deliver that report to the President's Office in Bastok.${prompt}
  3290: |-
    Be on your way then...
    Please hurry back to the homeland!${prompt}
  3291: |-
    I constantly pray.
    I pray for the future of Bastok.${prompt}
  3292: And I polish my fangs in case the days of war are near again...${prompt}
  3293: |-
    What in Goddess's name happened?
    You carried out your assignment properly, didn't you? Then why do you look so troubled?${prompt}
  3294: |-
    Don't tell me. I prefer not to know.
    It looks like if I heard what you had to say, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night. You better hurry back to our motherland.${prompt}
  3295: I've heard already... But I don't believe my ears! We're in a load of trouble now!${prompt}
  3296: |-
    I'd better tell the old wife too...
    Oh, but it's top secret, right? Then I'd better not, but...${prompt}
  3297: Oh, so you're a foreigner, huh? This is Windurst's Port District.${prompt}
  3298: If a map of Windurst is what you're after, then I suggest you head to the shops along the wharves there. A Mithra who sells maps works that area.${prompt}

  3335: Gatehouses are meeting and resting points for guards like us who serve and protect Windurst.${prompt}
  3336: They are also the places where missions from the Federation of Windurst are received.${prompt}

    I know, I know...
    Our minister is so self-centarued. He thinks of nothing but himself...${prompt}

    Really?
    I don't think it matters if your first impression with hoity-toity old him is good or not. Either way, it won't get you into his good books, will it?${prompt}

  3377: Thanks for your humdrum help today. We look forward to having you help us again during our next mayday...${prompt}

  3405: Did you know that the formerrr--now deceased--ministerrr of the Manustery invented Cardians to fight in warrr? The currrrent minister is his son.${prompt}
  3406: But it seems some of the original Cardians went out of control... I hope the current Minister doesn't repeat his father's mistakes!${prompt}
  3407: You should be used to doing missions by now, right?${prompt}
  3408: Today, I'm thinking of asking you to do a very important mission. Do you think you're up to it?${prompt}
  3409: It involves a trip to Giddeus. That's where the Yagudo beastmen dwell, on the far side of West Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  3410: Of course you know about the Yagudo, right? They were the enemy that Windurst fought against during the Great War, twenty years ago.${prompt}
  3411: Thanks to the efforts of the Star Sibyl, Windurst currently maintains amicable relations with them.${prompt}
  3412: But that means we have to regularly offer up gifts of food and weapons to the Yagudo.${prompt}
  3413: So, I'm thinking of having you deliver the next food offerings to them.${prompt}
  3414: The Rhinostery is responsible for preparing the next offerings. You can pick them up at the biological laboratory in the Windurst Waters district.${prompt}
  3415: Once you have received the food offerings from the researchers there, I want you to head straight to Giddeus.${prompt}
  3416: Finally, I'd like to re-emphasize that this mission is very important. Your actions could influence the future-wuture of Windurst, so don't mess it up!${prompt}
  3417: |-
    ...<phew>
    Did I sound convincingly scary-wary?♪${prompt}
  3418: |-
    For crying-wrying out loud!
    I told you... First head to the Rhinostery's biological laboratory in Windurst Waters, and pick up the food offerings to be taken to the Yagudo.${prompt}
  3419: The Rhinostery is more like a botanical garden than a research institute. It's by far the plainest of the five ministries.${prompt}
  3420: So you'rrre finally being sent to Giddeus? That place is confusing, with the paths twisting above and below grrround.${prompt}
  3421: Anyway, you had better head on overrr to the Rhinostery first. It's in the southern part of Windurst Waters.${prompt}

  3471: What's more, the summons came from the Sibyl Guard Semih Lafihna in person. Now that is scary-wary!${prompt}
  3472: Mithra have quite a temper, so I recommend you proceed straight to Heavens Tower. See you when you get back!${prompt}
  3473: The Sibyl Guards are an elite army corps of Mithra that protects Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  3474: I've heard rumors of them, but I've never seen them in the flesh. The job of the Sibyl Guards is to protect Heavens Tower, so it's rare to see them outside of there.${prompt}
  3475: I've hearrrd a lot of criticism about Semih Lafihna.${prompt}
  3476: While not being in serrrvice to our chieftainness, she is one of our tribal chieftan's favorrrites, so there are a lot of Mithra who resent herrr. If the color of your furrr is differrrent, you're bound to have a harrrd time.${prompt}

  3491: Or more to the point, why would our ding-a-ling minister head off to such a dangerous place as Castle Oztroja on his own?${prompt}
  3492: He's been more of an odd bod than usual ever since he found that restricted book that had been lost for decades. Don't tell me he's been cursed by the hocus pocus of that restricted book!?${prompt}
  3493: Castle Oztroja is the towering stronghold of the Yagudo king, locatarued deep within the Meriphataud Mountains.${prompt}
  3494: That's our minister for you! Settaruing off alone with nary a single War Warlock, thinking he's all manly... Nothing but recklessness!${prompt}

  3581: Well, I've had a great time in Windurst, and seen a lot of amazing stuff. Guess it's about time to head on home...${prompt}
  3582: Before I go, I have to find a souvenir of my stay that's unique to Windurst. But none of the stuff sold in the shops here is worth showing off to people...${prompt}
  3583: |-
    Hey, adventurer!
    Have you heard about a place out in Sarutabaruta somewhere called the Starfall Hillock?${prompt}
  3584: 'I''ve heard that at a certain time of night on that hill, the dew crystallizes into ice, forming ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  3585: |-
    The little missus would be so pleased if you could get your hands on one of those ice crystals. She's bound to think it's all cute and Märchen-like, don't you think?
    So how about it, huh? If you won't do it for me, do it for the little missus.${prompt}
  3586: 'Out in Sarutabaruta somewhere there''s a place called Starfall Hillock where, only for a few hours of each night, you can find a beautiful natural ice formation called ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  3587: They say Windurst is the country blessed by the moon and stars, so something to do with the stars would make a most fitting present, don't you think?${prompt}
  3588: I see Master Sigismund has asked you to go get him a memento of Windurst to take back as a souvenir.${prompt}
  3589: 'But what he doesn''t realize about ${item-plural: 1[2]} is that they''ll melt away in an instant if you touch them with your bare hands.${prompt}'
  3590: 'I''ve heard an old wives'' tale that you can use ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} in order to pick them up.${prompt}'
  3591: |-
    Oh, well done!
    I'm so pleased you were able to get me one. Let me see it...!${prompt}
  3592: '...Ah!${prompt}'
  3593: Why didn't you tell me that it melts away when you touch it with your bare hands? How am I supposed to carry that home then?${prompt}
  3594: But then again, you kept your side of the bargain, and a promise is a promise, so here... Take your reward and leave me be.${prompt}
  3595: If I had known it was that delicate I wouldn't have asked for one. It's impossible for me to carry such a fragile thing back home.${prompt}
  3596: Looks like I have to think of some other souvenir to take back, otherwise the little missus is gonna kill me. Umm... Let me see...${prompt}
  3597: Master Sigismund won't compromise and take back any old present to his wife. And if you've ever met the woman, you wouldn't blame him!${prompt}
  3598: But at this rate, we'll never be able to go home. Aaa～h, how I miss my family and friends.${prompt}
  3599: |-
    Gah-hahahah!
    This, me hearty, be the Fishermen's Guild, where sons of the sea gather! If any of ye landlubber-wubbers have a bone to pick with us, then go ahead, make me day!${prompt}
  3600: |-
    I be Chipmy-Popmy, me matey!
    And so long as there be fish out there, be it through rain or howling winds, I'll keep a row-row-rowing me boat!${prompt}
  3601: |-
    Never underestimate the sea.
    The weather is treacherously changeable, that if you're not careful you'll end up in Davy Jones's locker!${prompt}
  3602: You ain't much of a lookout unless you pay attention, not just to the waves and the wind, but to the clouds and the birds as well.${prompt}
  3603: A member of the Fishermen's Guild, Captain Chipmy-Popmy, has only ever been out on a ship a handful of times.${prompt}
  3604: He's too busy with the responsibilities of the guild, such as allocating fishing grounds to people or monitoring the weather, to be out there fishing from a ship.${prompt}
  3605: This be the Fishermen's Guild shop. What supplies will you be needin' today?${prompt}
  3606: |-
    Hee-hee-hee...
    When you scatterrr the bait like this, the fish all gatherrr togetherrr, and theirrr scales shine in the light. It's rrreal purrretty...${prompt}
  3607: Have you ever tried your hand at fishing? It's basically a contest of willpower between you and the fish, but there's no greataruer joy than when you finally catch a biggy...${prompt}
  3608: But you can also tell the conditions of the waters from the fish you catch. The longer you associatarue yourself with the sea, the more you come to understand it.${prompt}
  3609: Have you ever tried your hand at fishing? It's basically a contest of willpower between you and the fish, but there's no greataruer joy than when you finally catch a biggy...${prompt}
  3610: But you can also tell the conditions of the waters from the fish you catch. The longer you associatarue yourself with the sea, the more you come to understand it.${prompt}
  3611: 'Take the waters around here, for instaruance. Depending on how fat the ${item-plural: 1[2]} are, you can work out where to best cast your lines next.${prompt}'
  3612: 'So, if you happen to catch yourself ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, please show it to me. It''ll help me decide our fishing plans.${prompt}'

  3615: 'Oh, so you caught yourself ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, huh? Let me have a littarule looky-looky...${prompt}'
  3616: Gee... She's not that chubby-wubby, is she. Hmm... We can't expect a good catch just yet.${prompt}
  3617: "Thank you for your cooperation. \nHere...\nOh, and I'll hang on to this girl, so let that serve as compensation, all right?${prompt}"
  3618: I'll think the workers here will cook up this girl and have her for dinner. People who work with the sea have stomachs as big as their hearts.${prompt}
  3619: Outside of the town of Windurst, through this gate, lies West Sarutabaruta. It's a dangerous placey-wacey for the beginner adventurer.${prompt}
  3620: If you become lost-wosty, open your map to check your current location. For instance, right now we're on the corner of square B-5 of Port Windurst's map.${prompt}
  3621: If you head up this road from Fishmonger Landing, you'll come to the western gatehouse. If you head out through Shiva's Gate there, you'll find yourself in West Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  3622: It's a great place to explore and a great place to get wounded. Before you venture outside, ensure that your weapons and armor are equipped, and that you have the belongings you need. You want to become an accomplished adventurer, don'taru you?${prompt}
  3623: You want to check out Heavens Tower? It's right on the other side of Windurst from this port area, so you'll have to head way up north.${prompt}
  3624: Heavens Tower is a building that has been overtaken and covered by a giant star tree that is so big, its roots are said to hold the world together. It's the most famous spot in the whole of Windurst, so you should go have a looky-look.${prompt}
  3625: The porrrt district, by its very naturrre, has a lot of people coming and going all the time, so the chances of meeting up with bad company is greaterrr.${prompt}
  3626: Don't let the frrresh sea brrreeze get to your head. Keep yourrr wits about you always!${prompt}
  3627: Beyond this gateway is the Windurst residential area, where you can stay in a Mog House or Rent-a-Room.${prompt}
  3628: If you need to hear an explanation, that's Boronene's job.${prompt}
  3629: So pluck up the courage, and ask Boronene over there for all you need to knowy-wowy.${prompt}
  3630: The so-called gateway to the skies, the air travel agency, is over there in that building in front of us. You can see it, can'taryou?${prompt}
  3631: Windurst has restored its peace, so now rich people from other lands come to visit us. If you talk with them, they might tell you a tale or two about what's happening in the rest of the world.${prompt}

  3644: This is the super-duper Orastery. Here we run the Mage Academy, which organizes the mages that serve as town guards.${prompt}
  3645: If you are looking for our Minister, he's run off on one of his mumbo-jumbo experiments somewhere, and it doesn't look like he's coming back for quite some time. Oo～h, I wish I knew where he went...${prompt}
  3646: Either you are extremely brave to entaru such a dangerous place as this...${prompt}
  3647: '...or you don''t know much about our Mage Academy, do you?${prompt}'
  3648: The guard platoons who protect Windurst at each gatehouse... They're all affiliatarued with our Orastery.${prompt}
  3649: But they are just simple guards. It's not until they join the War Warlocks that they can feel any real pride in belonging to the Orastery.${prompt}
  3650: |-
    Be careful, now!
    This is a magic training area. It's far too dangerous for your average Joe Blow to be hanging around here!${prompt}
  3651: You can reach the outdoor training area from behind the platform there, but outside is even more dangerous than it is in here. Be especially careful-wareful if you're heading out there!${prompt}
  3652: |-
    This is hopeless-a-wopeless!
    It's just the same old wow-kapow and kaboom-a-boom-boom on the same old dummy Cardian target, over and over, day in and day out...${prompt}
  3653: It doesn't matter how fantastic-a-wastic the magic is! If I can only use it in here, then it is no more than a boring old fireworks display-a-way. Oh, how I want to try my spells out on real monsters!${prompt}
  3654: I, I, I'm a newcomer to the Orastery. B-but my dream is to be like the great hero Karaha-Baruha, a-and do a great service to my country during w-war.${prompt}
  3655: You see...I think a war's about to begin. A-and a lot of people are gonna die, like in the last war. I, I wanna stop that from happening!${prompt}
  3656: I am, oh am, Ohruru. I have been studying status changing magic for nigh on twenty-five years now, oh now-now-now.${prompt}

  3660: The Great War of twenty years ago was a woeful tragedy. So many brilliant warriors of the Orastery's War Warlocks were felled.${prompt}
  3661: Too much is lost in times of warfare. Even if true peace, the most precious thing of all, is gained...${prompt}
  3662: There ain't enuff War Warlocks for us to fight a war right now. Afta' all, it's only been twenty -dd years since the last one...${prompt}
  3663: There ain't been enuff time to train skilled people, so we'd be in a right proper fix if a war started all o' a sudden, wouldn't we now?${prompt}
  3664: Shut ya mouth and leave me alone!${prompt}
  3665: |-
    I'm having enough trouble fighting off me own lazy tendencies as it is!
    High-yah!${prompt}
  3666: Aa～ah. No mattaru how much I practice every day my magic powers just don't seem to be improving. You'd think magic would improve like magic, wouldn'taru?${prompt}
  3667: Why, this is just the same as practaruicing fencing or archery! Was magic meant to be like this?${prompt}
  3668: Do the words “elemental resistance” mean anything to you? As in, the stronger your resistance to fire is, the less damage you will receive from fire magic, and so on...?${prompt}
  3669: Well, don't go getting it wrong, now. Just 'cause your fire resistance is strong doesn'taru mean the fire magic you cast is strong as well. You get whataru I mean?${prompt}

  3677: Here's your reward, oh reward, as promised. My prescription is that you should get out more-more-more.${prompt}

  3689: Warfare is all 'bout doin' a pre-emptive strike. That's why black mages are pivotal to any war.${prompt}
  3690: 'Yet how''z they to win the battle unless they invest in their wands? The black mages in our War Warlocks need ${item-plural: 3[2]}.${prompt}'
  3691: The bigger the war, the more influence the number of troops has on the final victory.${prompt}
  3692: 'Life is a limited resource. You can''t just make new lives straight away, can you? In order to protect these precious lives, we need ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  3693: Enhancement magic is like an invisible reinforcement-ment-ment. It does unexpected damage and can confuse, oh confuse, your opponent greatly, oh greatly-greatly-greatly.${prompt}

    I'm in such a helter-skelter fix!
    I'm currently preparing the budget for next year, and the captains of the black, white, and red mage brigades of the War Warlocks are all squeezing me for more arms funding.${prompt}
  3696: But as usual, our flub-the-dub minister has gone AWOL on us, so there's no one here who can form their hodgepodge of opinions into a clear-cut policy.${prompt}
  3697: I guess there's no choice but for us to decide the fair share on our own. We are in charge of operations, but know next to nothing about the performance of the various handy-dandy wands they are requesting.${prompt}
  3698: I'd like to get my hands on one of each of the three types of wands and compare their make-or-break performance until everyone agrees on which wands are best. If only someone would help me obtain them...${prompt}
  3699: |-
    Wanda help?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, it'd be wanderful!
    No. Wander away.${prompt}
  3700: Why...thank you so very much for the nicey-nice offer! Just one of each kind of wand would be enough for us to try out. I'm counting on you, hotshot!${prompt}
  3701: Ask the fuddy-duddy head of each brigade of the War Warlocks for the names of the three wands. Oh, and make sure you obtain your own hipper-dipper wands to give us. Don't go giving us wands that you borrowed from others, now!${prompt}
  3702: |-
    Why, you hoddy-doddy!
    Turning your back on a person in need. Holy moley...${prompt}
  3703: I'm currently preparing the budget for next year, and the fuddy-duddy captains of the black, white, and red Mage brigades of the War Warlocks are all squeezing me for more arms funding.${prompt}
  3704: I have no choice but to obtain one of each of the three types of wands they want, and compare their make-or-break performance. So, please get me one of each type of wand.${prompt}
  3705: I'd like to say that we could give you your wands back after we finish the performance comparison tests...${prompt}
  3706: '...But the problem is, we can''t ensure the wands will survive the testaruing process in one piece!${prompt}'
  3707: Make sure you get us one of those wands the red mage's brigadier general wants!${prompt}
  3708: If the red mage regiment gets more wands, then maybe, just maybe-a-waybe, I'll get a better hand-me-down wand!${prompt}
  3709: I, I hope the black mage's brigade of the War Warlocks get what they hope for.${prompt}
  3710: |-
    <mumble-wumble>...
    M-make sure you get a better wand for the black mages than you get for the others, okay?${prompt}
  3711: Actually, the three types of wands the brigadier generals want should be in storage in the Orastery's depository...${prompt}
  3712: Oh, but during last year's budget meetings they raided the depository and went wild with them, so, erm, I guess that's why they are asking you to bring-wring them new ones.${prompt}

    Ohoho!
    Well, I was holding back, you know.${prompt}
  3732: '......${prompt}'

    Don't be angry, now. Don't be mad.
    It is a rare experience--to see Minister Ajido-Marujido and I match each other in magic--like that you've just had.${prompt}
  3734: |-
    Here, I'll give you this, my friend...
    It should provide you hours of fun on your weekend. Ohohoho～!${prompt}
  3735: So, what was it you were trying to do in my absence?${prompt}
  3736: Wouldn't your time be better spent improving your magic abilities rather than playing in a magic competition?${prompt}
  3737: The brigadier generals of the War Warlocks have been pushing me to budget for their own equipment preferences, so I was trying to test these three different wands, and decide which to buy...fair and square!${prompt}
  3738: You should be the one to decide, Minister Ajido-Marujido! That way everything will be settaruled peacefully.${prompt}
  3739: You're talking about next year's budget, rightaru?${prompt}
  3740: Oh, I've already placed the orders with Jeuno. I bought swords, axes, armor, shields...${prompt}
  3741: Hold on a second, Minister! None of those bric-a-brac can be used by mages, can they???${prompt}
  3742: Hahaha, I bought them for you boys in Operations, silly! Anyway, that should keep you busy working on them for a while. See you around, boys. Ta-taru.${prompt}
  3743: He's buying up weapons and armor from other countries for us to study in order to improve our strategic skills, I guess.${prompt}
  3744: But wouldn't that suggest a possibility of antagonizing these other countries...? Don't tell me our Orastery staff have to read that far into the mattaru...?${prompt}
  3745: Okey-dokey. Now I see... The minister finally understands the importance of our Operations section. Some may think such learning is expensive, but the cost of ignorance can be much greater.${prompt}
  3746: |-
    But getting back to where we were...
    I'm sorry, but it seems we broke one of your wands. Here, please take this as an itsy-bitsy token of our regrets...${prompt}
  3747: If that's the minister's policy, there ain't much we can do, is there?${prompt}
  3748: Let 'im flower the Operations Division with resources this time. In large-scale warfare, a superior strategy can turn the status of the battle around one-eighty degrees.${prompt}
  3749: What to do with Doctor Shantotto!?${prompt}
  3750: On the occasions that she does drop in on the Orastery, she annoys the heck out of us, then leaves. But I guess that's what makes Doctor Shantotto Doctor Shantotto.${prompt}
  3751: |-
    Hah!
    I'm not the least bit upset, oh upset-upset-upset...${prompt}
  3752: |-
    It's only a matter of time before each battle is won, oh won-won-won. It's like poison, slowly wearing you down as each moment passes-es-es.
    Teh-heh-heh...${prompt}
  3753: Doc Shantotto's one scary-a-wary granny!${prompt}
  3754: Quite a number of my predecessors have whamming-a-bamming fallen victim to her screwball acts.${prompt}
  3755: |-
    Oh, wow!
    I, I got to see the great Doctor Shantotto's magic firsthand!${prompt}
  3756: During the war years, as the previous minister here, it was her magic powers that determined our very survival. She, she is more than just my heroine, she's my goddess!${prompt}
  3757: Enjoy the little magic show there? Doc Shantotto's always unleashing her mighty magic on anyone and everyone without mercy.${prompt}
  3758: That's how we lose more than the odd wand or two... My head hurts at the thought-wought of all the equipment she's wasted so far!${prompt}
  3759: Heeber-jeebers!${prompt}
  3760: Whoa! You scared the wits out of silly-billy me. I thought you were Minister Ajido-Marujido.${prompt}
  3761: You see...the true-blue truth is... I kinda snapped the minister's favorite wand into two.${prompt}
  3762: I was just discussing with Kuroido-Moido how we can pull a rigajig swifty on the minister!${prompt}
  3763: I never said we should pull a swift one on him! Acts of badness will always come to light eventarually, you know? Besides, you were the one who suggestarued it first, Hakkuru-Rinkuru!${prompt}
  3764: We've already hurried-scurried and ordered a new wand. Keeping it quiet until the replacement comes isn't an act of badness, is it?${prompt}
  3765: 'In sticky situations like this, I''ve heard that if you have an ooey-gooey ${item-singular: 1[2]} you can glue a broken wand back together again.${prompt}'
  3766: |-
    My hotshot adventurer!
    I'll pay you a handsome ransom if you can go find me ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}
  3767: |-
    Agree to help fix the stick?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes. Stick together!
    No. Stick it out!${prompt}
  3768: |-
    Wand-erful!
    I'm counting on you, so stick to it!${prompt}
  3769: I'm stating this for the record, but I am having no partaru in this!${prompt}
  3770: Heeber-jeebers!${prompt}
  3771: 'If only I had ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} I could mend the broken wand...or so the local armorer maintains...so it must be true!${prompt}'
  3772: It seems that the zoot-snoot Goblins in Tahrongi Canyon often carry them. One should be enough, so please go find me one!${prompt}
  3773: I'm stating this for the record, but I am having no partaru in this!${prompt}
  3774: We shouldn'taru have tried to clean the minister's important wand to begin with! He always told us not to touch the wand's case!${prompt}
  3775: Whoa! Heebee jeebees! You're just in time! We just heard word that the minister is on his way back now.${prompt}
  3776: |-
    Thanks. You're the bee's knees!
    Here's your handsome ransom, in lieu of hush money. Now I've got to hurry and fix this wand!${prompt}
  3777: I've got to hurry-scurry and fix this wand before the minister gets back!${prompt}
  3778: I wonder why the minister places such importarunce on that wand? It doesn't look like it has any particular value.${prompt}
  3779: |-
    Whoa! Holy moley!
    Major depression.${prompt}
  3780: Let me explain why Hakkuru-Rinkuru is so down in the dumps...${prompt}
  3781: You remember the little incident where he accidentarully broke the minister's wand, don'taru you? He was able to pull the wool over the minister's eyes up until he replaced the wand with a new one.${prompt}
  3782: But our minister knows his stuff! Seems the minister took one look at the new wand, realized it had been switched, and gave Hakkuru-Rinkuru a right royal telling off!${prompt}
  3783: |-
    No, Kuroido-Moido, you got it wrong!
    He didn't get an itty-bitty bit angry with me at all, even though he had every right... That's why I am so depressed!${prompt}
  3784: You've got me confused. What's the problem then?${prompt}
  3785: We all very well know Minister Ajido-Marujido's hoity-toity sarcastic personality. But he didn't even spare me a single sarcastic remark.${prompt}
  3786: He just went all quiet and huffed off all of a sudden. I bet he had such ill will he couldn't express himself in words!${prompt}
  3787: |-
    Wha-a～aaa!
    I'm going to be fired for sure after this hubbub!${prompt}
  3788: "Hmm...It is just as I feared. \nThat wasn'taru just your average wand we were dealing with there. It wasn'taru something that you could replace by simply buying a new one.${prompt}"
  3789: You sent the old wand off to the magic incinerator, rightaru? I wonder if they've already incinerated it?${prompt}
  3790: Waa～a! I'm such a ding-a-ling! I'm going to be fired for sure this time!${prompt}
  3791: It seems my colleague sent the old wand off to the magic incinerator in Garlaige Citadel.${prompt}
  3792: It's probably too late to save it from being burnt to a crisp...${prompt}
  3793: Hmm... Looks like you saved the day. This is undeniably our minister's original wand.${prompt}
  3794: Looky here, Hakkuru-Rinkuru! Seems the wand hasn't been “fired,” so neither will you...${prompt}
  3795: Woohoo! What a cheerful earful! I'm not going to be fired after all!${prompt}
  3796: |-
    There, there...
    Now all we have to do is wait for the minister to come back...${prompt}
  3797: 'Hi-diddly-diddly! Is my dear brother in?${wait-animation: 1}'
  3798: Ah...Miss Apururu!${prompt}
  3799: |-
    Hidey-hi!
    Hmm... Looks like brother dearest is away as usual. That is so typical of him!${prompt}
  3800: What's the emergency, Miss?${prompt}
  3801: |-
    No emergency...
    But today, a pile of Cardian weapons were suddenly delivered to my door from none other than our dear Ajido-Marujido...${prompt}
  3802: I recall saying that I was in a jam because we didn't have enough money to buy weapons for our Cardians, but I don't remember asking him to buy us any!${prompt}
  3803: Don't you think it is kind of strange? It is very unlike him to suddenly do something like that for no reason. So, I was wondering what has gotten into him...?${prompt}
  3804: |-
    Oh, goodness-woodness...
    That wand you have there...${prompt}
  3805: Now this brings back memories! This is the wand that my brother and I had fought over so much when we were children. It wound up broken in two!${prompt}
  3806: Not that we were the ones to break it, mind you. Our mother, Goddess bless her soul, was the one who snapped it!${prompt}
  3807: She meant to teach us the lesson that when two people fight over something, it will surely get broken...${prompt}
  3808: I can't recall ever being so frightened of our mother...${prompt}
  3809: |-
    Wowie-zowie!
    Sounds like she was a scary woman when she wanted to be.${prompt}
  3810: '......${prompt}'
  3811: Well, anyway, I had best get back to my own ministry. When my brother returns, tell him I said “thank you.” Ta-ta～ru, everyone!${prompt}
  3812: Although it's an incy-wincy bit hard to believe at times, our minister and Miss Apururu really are brother and sister...${prompt}
  3813: |-
    But, hey... Jeezy-peezy!
    Doesn't that mean the wand was broken to begin with?${prompt}
  3814: |-
    Now I get the picture...
    When our minister saw the wand that Hakkuru-Rinkuru had fixed with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, he must have thought his dear mother was trying to tell him something!${prompt}
  3815: |-
    But if that's the case, then...
    If we don't stick this wand back together again, they'll return to being the fightaruing siblings that they originally were.${prompt}
  3816: Hmm...${prompt}
  3817: There's a lot of things you don't know about this world until you actually go see for yourself...${prompt}
  3818: Our daddy's a sailor-man, so sis and I are waiting for daddy's ship to come back.${prompt}
  3819: My mommy told us not to speak to strangers...and you sure are stranger than most!${prompt}
  3820: |-
    Paytah, you dummy!
    Didn't mommy tell you not to speak with strangers? Don't come crying to me if you get in trouble!${prompt}
  3821: I'm in big trouble! The wind blew my daddy's hat into the sea.${prompt}
  3822: |-
    Daddy's gonna be so angry!
    I'm gonna get a walloping!
    <sniff> <sniff> Waaaaaah!${prompt}

    Ah...! Thank you!
    Now my daddy can go sailing again.${prompt}
  3835: |-
    But, wait...?
    This isn't my daddy's cap...?${prompt}
  3836: Don't you go taking something that doesn't belong to you! I'll tell mommy on you, and mommy will get real angry!${prompt}
  3837: |-
    Uh...here...
    Take it back!
    <sob>...Waaaaa～aah!!!${prompt}
  3838: This is the gateway to Windurst's residential area. Inside, there are Mog Houses available for use by citizens of Windurst.${prompt}

  3844: Why don'taru head up to your Mog House now and rest your tired little body-wody?${prompt}
  3845: This is the gateway to Windurst's residential area. Inside, there are Mog Houses available for use by citizens of Windurst.${prompt}

    Okey-dokey... Consider it done!

    Not to worry... Not to worry...
    We can lend rooms out to people from other countries too. We just call them Rent-a-Rooms, but they are nearly the same as Mog Houses, anyway.${prompt}

    Lease a Rent-a-Room?

    Yes.
    No.${prompt}

    I have assigned a Rent-a-Room for your use inside Windurst's residential area. You are free to start using it whenever you see fit.${prompt}
  3860: What in Windurst is going on? The airship from Jeuno arrived hours ago, but our flub-the-dub minister is nowhere to be seen.${prompt}
  3861: What's the matter with him? It's been weeks since he suddenly upped and left us in a helter-skelter.${prompt}
  3862: And when he finally sends us a teensy-weensy message, it just reads, “I have a lot of luggage, so come meet me at the airship port!”${prompt}
  3863: Our Minister of the Orastery has an amazing gift of forgettaruing and breaking promises.${prompt}
  3864: Why, he's probably even forgottaruen that he sent us a message to begin with!${prompt}
  3865: |-
    Oh bother-wother!
    The Orastery would get on fine without him, but his niminy-piminy sister, Apururu, is the trouble. No one can stand her loud mouth.${prompt}
  3866: I think it's because she's so annoying that the minister is always absentaru.${prompt}
  3867: "Ahhh... \nThe way things are going, I wonder whether our minister can really save Windurst...${prompt}"
  3868: Uh-oh! Jeepers creepers! Here comes that Sibyl Guard again...${prompt}
  3869: I bet it's got to do with the minister again. I suggest we get out of here before she asks us all sorts of questions and gets us into trouble.${prompt}
  3870: Yes. A quick getaruway is in order.${prompt}
  3871: What's the matter, my adventurer frrriend? Overwhelmed by the size of this fine city?${prompt}

    I am Semih Lafihna.
    I am a perrrsonal guard to the Star Sibyl, who presides over the lands of Windurst.${prompt}
  3879: If you intend on settling in Windurst, feel free to ask me forrr advice. Is there anything you want to know?${prompt}
  3880: |-
    Ask for advice on...
    ${selection-lines}
    How to go outside and battle.
    Where to shop.
    How to gain information.
    Where am I? Who am I?${prompt}
  3881: I wouldn't recommend running strrraight out to battle, but if you are confident of your abilities, I won't stop you.${prompt}
  3882: If you climb up to the top of this rrroad, it should lead you to the western gatehouse.${prompt}
  3883: Pass through Shiva's Gate to go outside to West Sarutabaruta. The outside world is full of ferrrocious monsters, so you'll have to fend for yourself.${prompt}
  3884: I'm sure you know this already, but before you pick a fight, you should “check” your opponent! Try not to pick a fight with a foe you cannot defeat.${prompt}
  3885: |-
    Grrr...?
    Look what the cat just drrragged in...${wait-animation: 1}
  3886: I'm sorrrry to have to cut our conversation short, but I have to run now...${prompt}
  3887: Ask the Jack of Clubs if there's anything else you need to know. He's the Cardian nearrr the Orastery entrance.${prompt}
  3888: If you trade him this, he'll give you a rewarrrd. You do that by targeting Jack, then selecting “Trade” from the main menu.${prompt}
  3889: Well, do your utmost for the sake of the peace of Windurst and the Star Sibyl. If you do, I'm surrre we'll cross paths again.${prompt}
  3890: |-
    Shopping...?
    Port Windurst, wherrre we are presently, has the most shops out of all of Windurst.${prompt}
  3891: Down along the shore there's a pier where three boats are wharved in a rrrow.${prompt}
  3892: The boat closest to shore houses Kususu's Hoodoos, a magic store. It's perrrfect if you want to buy all the initial magic spells.${prompt}
  3893: The other two boats house Hohbiba-Mubiba's Wands of Wonder, and Guruna-Maguruna Tailoring.${prompt}
  3894: Both magic users and the non-magically inclined alike should be able to fulfill most of their equipment needs therrre.${prompt}
  3895: You'll need plenty of gil if you want to purrrchase the stronger equipment. Monsters you defeat will drop various spoils. I suggest you sell them to increase your gil.${prompt}
  3896: Oh, and on the western docks is the Fishermen's Guild. You can buy any fishing supplies you need there.${prompt}
  3897: I can only pass on to you the rumorrrs that I know...${prompt}
  3898: So, if you don't mind acting on hearsay, then here goes. What kind of inforrrmation are you interested in?${prompt}
  3899: |-
    Ask for information on...?
    ${selection-lines}
    Helping people.
    Monster patrol.
    Easy money.
    Looking for work.${prompt}
  3900: I don't know whether you can call it helping people or not, but you might like to inquire at the Manustery.${prompt}
  3901: The Manustery goes from one harrrdship to another. They can always do with a helping hand.${prompt}
  3902: Oh, the Manustery's Cardian laboratory is in the predominantly Mithra suburrrb known as Windurst Woods.${prompt}
  3903: Follow that road until you reach the air trrravel agency, turn left and you'll see an arrrch that leads to Windurst Woods.${prompt}
  3904: I'll let you find out what Carrrdians are by yourrrself. Heh-heh-heh.${prompt}
  3905: Actually, when you meet the Minister of the Manustery, Apururu, I should get you to ask her when the Minister of the Orrrastery is due ba...${prompt}
  3906: By “easy money,” I prrresume you mean jobs that give you gil without having to battle monsters for it?${prompt}
  3907: Then try the hatter in Windurst Waters. The proprietorrr always has some harebrained scheme he wants help with.${prompt}
  3908: To get to Windurst Waters, follow this rrroad back up there...${prompt}
  3909: If I recall, Illu Bohjaa, the dhalmel farmer, has been asking for help in reducing the number of crawlers in these parts.${prompt}
  3910: The dhalmel farm is in the neighboring suburb, Windurst Woods. To get there, follow this road straight ahead and pass through the north arch.${prompt}
  3911: If it's work you're looking forrr, go to one of the gatehouses.${prompt}
  3912: The nearest gatehouse is right therrre, back up that slope behind you.${prompt}
  3913: Gatehouses are special places that hand out missions on behalf of the Federation of Windurst.${prompt}
  3914: As you complete missions obtained from the gatehouses, yourrr rank points will increase.${prompt}
  3915: Collect enough rank points and yourrr rank, or position within this country, will rise. You're currently rank one, by the way.${prompt}
  3916: You can only accept one mission at a time, so you'll have to complete your current task properrrly before you try to move onto the next.${prompt}
  3917: Rise in rank enough, and maybe I'll come to you directly and ask you to do a mission forrr me one day!${prompt}
  3918: I have high hopes for you. I'm sure one day you'll be considerrred an indispensable agent of Windurst.${prompt}
  3919: |-
    Well, I'd better get going soon.
    Wait a moment...! Look what the cat just drrragged in...${prompt}
  3920: Forrrgive me, but I have to run. I'm surrre we will cross paths again, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  3921: You are in Port Windurst, Windurst's gateway to the air.${prompt}
  3922: Forrr instance, if you cross this open space and follow the path to the east farrr enough, you'll find the air travel agency where the airships operate out of.${prompt}
  3923: In order to ride an airship though, you'll need to have gained quite an amount of fame or forrrtune. But...${prompt}
  3924: '...I''m sure you''ll work hard enough to ride on an airrrship one day. You''ll then be able to fly to a country called Jeuno.${prompt}'
  3925: There are also a lot of shops in this port area. There's the Fishermen's Guild, a magic shop, an armorer and a weapons trader on the wharrrves here.${prompt}
  3926: They might not have an impressive assorrrtment, but I'm sure it is enough for the beginner.${prompt}
  3927: Then finally, there is the most imporrrtant building in the port area, the Orastery and its Mage Academy, that you can see behind me.${prompt}
  3928: The Orastery is one of Windurst's five ministries of magic, most famous forrr its War Warlocks, an army composed of talented mages and magic users.${prompt}
  3929: Only the most elite Tarutaru are affiliated with the War Warlocks, so some are a rrreal handful to keep in line at ti...${prompt}
  3930: |-
    Grr...!
    Speaking of “witch”...${prompt}
  3931: Sorry to cut my explanation short, but I have to go.${prompt}

  3940: |-
    Burnite shells...?
    Where have I heard that name before?${prompt}

    That's it!
    If I remember correctly, Doctor Yoran-Oran in Windurst Walls had one once...${prompt}
  3942: |-
    Huh?
    Oh, you mean the kiddy-widdy who got into trouble here the other day?${prompt}
  3943: Yeah, I remember. He was one of the students in the advanced class we had visit here.${prompt}
  3944: I scolded him for using one of the Mage Academy's wands without permission.${prompt}
  3945: But it was our ministry's supervisors who were really-weally to blame for not locking the cupboards properly while we had children visiting.${prompt}
  3946: We have a lot of wands for the senior students here, and most of them are quite dangerous.${prompt}
  3947: Which wand was it that they messed around with...? Let me see... I think it was a Wand of Sleep.${prompt}
  3948: A Wand of Sleep, as the name suggests, is enhanced with a Sleep spell that puts the person on its receiving end into a deep slumber-wumber.${prompt}
  3949: What's that you say? The kiddy-widdy has had a Sleep spell cast on him?${prompt}
  3950: Well, to awaken someone from a Sleep spell you just have to hit them really hard, but I guess you can't go around bashing up children, can you?${prompt}
  3951: 'Then, why don''taru try and make him drink ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}? That ought to wake the kiddy-widdy up.${prompt}'

  3998: Oh, you'd betterrr be carrreful then. Sounds like you'rrre making me out to be some kind of baddy, or something?${prompt}
  3999: If you're out to stop baddies, then you should be chasing after the Minister of the Orastery, Ajido-Marujido, not me! He's the one to watch, you know?${prompt}

    Huh?
    Is that true?${prompt}
  4001: Don't ask me! I don't know...I don't pay much attention to wumors.${prompt}
  4002: Then allow me to fill you in. The ministerrr of the Orastery is trying to revive “summoning magic”--the verrry magic that the Star Sibyl has forrrbidden.${prompt}
  4003: That evil little magician is abusing his authorrrity as ministerrr and acting out of line. But because he's a ministerrr, the Tarutaru grrrown-ups let him do as he pleases.${prompt}

  4067: We seem to be seeing a lot of Semih Lafihna, the Sibyl Guard who protects the great Star Sibyl at Heavens Tower, in these parts lately-wately.${prompt}
  4068: I wonder if there was some kind of incident that she's checking out here? I bet it's that Cat Burglar getting up to her usual tricks again!${prompt}
  4069: How come Humeys and Elvaanys changey so much in appearance as they get oldery?${prompt}
  4070: I bet they never get boredy-woredy changing so muchy everyday. Maybe they even enjoy growing oldery?${prompt}
  4071: That there is the notorious Mage Academy, bastion of badness!${prompt}
  4072: Well, in truth, it's the minister of this ministry who's really the notoriously bad one there!${prompt}
  4073: Wowy-wow-wow! You see them from here? Those high-level magic users are practaruicing their spells over there!${prompt}
  4074: The Orastery operates that Mage Academy, which is in charge of training and running the armies of pro magic users. Oh, what I'd give to be able to join them!${prompt}
  4075: Keep heading east through here, and you'll be on the road to Windurst Woods, home to most of the Mithra in this town.${prompt}
  4076: The Mithra are originally from another land, far across the seas. They say the Mithra originally arrived in Windurst to lend us a hand back when we were at war with the beastmen.${prompt}
  4077: |-
    Shhh!
    Be quiet or my daughter will notice me. I'm shadowing her to see that she doesn't get into any trouble-wouble...${prompt}

    See, I made it all the way to this magic shop on my own! Mommy is going to be sooo pleasedy-weasedy!${prompt}
  4081: The sale of high-level magic to adventurers has been restricted since the last Star Reading ceremony, but they've just gone and decided to lift the ban.${prompt}
  4082: Seems that Ajido-Marujido, the Minister of the Orastery, heavied the other ministers to getaru his way.${prompt}
  4083: What kind of lands are there in the vast world that lies on the other side of these oceans? I dream of being like those adventurers who travel-wravel across the sea to unknown lands.${prompt}
  4084: I know that there are unimaginable danger-wangers that await them there, but they say a girl's mind adores danger.${prompt}
  4085: I'm glad beastmen don't know how to steer-a-weer ships. You see, Windurst is practically defenseless against attack-a-wacks from the sea.${prompt}
  4086: It'd be a different matter if Cardians could swim-a-wim, but those automatons have a hard enough time trying to keep afloat-a-woat!${prompt}
  4087: What is it that makes them airships fly? Don't they sometimes drop from the sky?${prompt}
  4088: What kind of magic keeps them up? And who was it that invented them and when? Oh, you're just like the others, yup? Why can't anyone answer my questions then!?${prompt}
  4089: |-
    Haven'taru ever heard...?
    Somewhere on the other side of the sea there is an ancient harbor town.${prompt}
  4090: All kinds of strange and wonderful plant life grow around that harbor town. It seems the Rhinostery's biological laboratory has struck a deal to obtain these plants via the nearby port town of Mhaura.${prompt}
  4091: This road leads to Windurst Woods, y'know? But I better warn ya, that place is crawling with Mithra!${prompt}
  4092: Not that they do it on paw-puss...oops, I means purpose...but them Mithra just don't look where they're treading-wedding! So, us Tarutaru have gotta look out that we's don't get trampled-wampled to deaths!${prompt}
  4093: |-
    Don'taru you know?
    Not just anyone can go hopping on and off those airships like a rabid rarab.${prompt}
  4094: You first need to buy a pass, but they cost a pretty penny, they do! I hate to judge people by their appearances, but boy, by the looks of things, you ain't got a hope of flying the friendly skies on no airship!${prompt}

  4098: The sea cultivates an unlimited assorrrtment of gifts that it gives to the land dwellerrrs. But what do the land dwellerrrs give the sea back in returrrn?${prompt}
  4099: I came all the way frrrom the countrrryside in the hopes of becoming a Sibyl Guarrrd to guarrrd the Starrr Sibyl, but they sent me packing, saying I didn't have what it takes...${prompt}
  4100: Ahhh... But it is trrrue that my bow skills seem like child's play when comparrred to the likes of those women. I guess I must go and learrrn to hunt from scrrratch underrr the guidance of my trrribal chieftainness.${prompt}
  4101: How to gain the skills requirrred to become a master-hunterrr, or “ranger”. That rrreminds me. I have to go meet Perih Vashai... She should be in the Mithra parrrt of town...${prompt}
  4102: I was invited to join the secrrret meeting behind the warrrehouses, but I can't find them. What's a girrrl to do?${prompt}
  4103: On the otherrr side of this ocean therrre is a small harborrr town that is the homeland of us Mithra. My motherrr and sisterrr still live therrre.${prompt}
  4104: But I chose to obey the voice of naturrre and jourrrney out into the unknown as a warriorrr. Even though I pine for my homeland, I know I probably will neverrr set foot on its ground everrr again...${prompt}
  4105: Windurst Woods, the predominately Mithra parrrt of town, lies beyond herrre. If you arrre interrrested in handicrafts then you will be pleased to know that the Boneworkers' Guild and Weavers' Guild are located therrre.${prompt}
  4106: There's no place like home, heh? Well, there arrre some Mithra who say this is not and will neverrr be theirrr home...${prompt}
  4107: But for Mithra like myself, who were borrrn after the warrr, Windurst is the only home we know.${prompt}
  4108: So this is one of the wooden puppet-monsters the Tarutaru created, eh?${prompt}
  4109: Why, it looks a lot cuter than I had expected. Let's see if it will eat these nuts. Here boy, eat! C'mon eat it, boy!${prompt}
  4110: '''Tis said that red mages use magic to enchant their swords! Could they truly be so irresponsible? They would kill the noble blade!${prompt}'
  4111: The way of the sword is to cut away all that is not the sword! Superfluous feelings, wandering thoughts, and the trappings of magic have no place. Not even the sun's rays should be allowed to roam along its steel, really.${prompt}
  4112: The airships were invented by Jeuno, you know? The Archduke of Jeuno believes we are heading into an age of the skies, so he gathered masterminds together to create those flying ships.${prompt}
  4113: But knowing that by no means lessens how amazing those things are...${prompt}
  4114: There are regular flights from Jeuno to Windurst, San d'Oria, and Bastok, so we'll eventually be returning on the airship between Windurst and Jeuno.${prompt}
  4115: I'm hoping our next post is in San d'Oria...once I've bought all the souvenirs I want from Windurst, that is.${prompt}
  4116: It seems we Galka are a rare sight in these parts.${prompt}
  4117: There's been a steady flow of Tarutaru each taking their turn to stand and stare at us. While it doesn't make me feel unwelcome, it doesn't exactly make me feel comfortable either.${prompt}
  4118: If they're that interested in us, then why don't they come right up to us and have a closer look, rather than peeking out from the shadows?${prompt}
  4119: I want to tell them that straight to their faces, but those Tarutaru run away before I can approach them.${prompt}
  4120: |-
    Erk...!
    Oh my Goddess, do I feel sick!?${prompt}
  4121: |-
    I, I'm going to die, aren't I...?
    Eww, if that'll ease this feeling, then maybe it's for the better. Just say sorry to all my fans back home...${prompt}
  4122: Will I leave anything behind for them to remember me by...? BAAARRRRFFFFF!!!${prompt}
  4123: I heard Windurst is a land of magic users, but it doesn't look like everyone around here can actually use magic.${prompt}
  4124: Just goes to show...there's a lot of things you don't know about this world until you actually go see for yourself!${prompt}
  4125: Don't tell me he's thinking of some sort of mischief again? Oh, Master Sigismund...!${prompt}
  4126: We'll be late for our airship again. I've lost count of the number of flights we've missed!${prompt}
  4127: Have you, traveler, also come to Windurst to take a looky at the Great Star Tree? If so, then the star tree, also known as Heavens Tower, is far to the northeasty of here, in Windurst Walls.${prompt}
  4128: If you wanty, I can use my magic to sendy you to Windurst Walls in an instant. Would you likey that?${prompt}

  4227: Anyway, welcome aboard!${prompt}
  4228: So you've become a memberrr of the Starrr Onion Brigade, huh?${prompt}

  4244: Hey, newbie!${prompt}

  4247: |-
    Oi, newbie!
    If you hurry up and bring us four ${item-plural: 1[2]}, we'll tell you all about our showdown with the Cat Burglar!${prompt}
  4248: |-
    Attaboy!
    These are just what I wanted!${prompt}
  4249: We can make some stinky bombs with these! Kinda like the ones we made the other day when...${prompt}
  4250: |-
    ...And that's how we made off with the Cat Burglar's Mana Orb.
    Pretty awesome, huh?${prompt}
  4251: If you want to join in our major projects like this one, you'll have to participate in our meetings! Anyway, until then, see you around, I s'pose!${prompt}
  4252: I've received some new information...information regarding the activities of none other than the Cat Burglar herself!${prompt}
  4253: She has been seen loitering in the vicinity of the haunted mansion in Windurst Walls, otherwise known to us as the “ghosty house”!${prompt}
  4254: This piece of intelligence was provided to us by the Star Onion Brigade's Windurst Walls Recon Team, Juna Moshal and Chomomo. A round of applause for the two of them...${prompt}
  4255: Da ghosty house in Windurst Walls...? Wasn't dat owiginally supposed to be de doctor's wesidence for the minister of de Optistewy?${prompt}
  4256: |-
    Precisely...
    No one is supposed to live there, except <gasp!> occasionally you can see suspicious shadows moving inside there!${prompt}
  4257: But doesn't that house have some sort of impenetrrrable magic locks on its doorrrs?${prompt}
  4258: Correct! That's what makes it all the more intriguing! I have a feeling that the Cat Burglar's next target is that very building!${prompt}
  4259: Everyone, listen up! This time it's war! Once we have our weapons and provisions ready, we are to march straight to the ghosty house and lay a trap to bag the Cat Burglar once and for all!${prompt}
  4260: |-
    Grrreat leaderrr!
    What kind of trrrap shall we lay for herrr this time?${prompt}

    Hey, newbie!
    You can be in charge of traps! We'll need four ${item-plural: 1[2]} so hurry up and get them!${prompt}

  4266: Up and at 'em!
  4267: Herrre we go again!
  4268: Meow!
  4269: 'Having the right trap waiting for the Cat Burglar is really important. Hurry up and bring us four ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  4270: Then we can march to the ghosty house and set an ambush for her!${prompt}
  4271: Dis looks like a job for my twusty Super Onion Staff--a legendawy weapon dat has been handed down in my family since my gwandfather's day!${prompt}
  4272: Ha-haa! Just you wait, Cat Burglar! You'll be no match for me and my staff!${prompt}
  4273: My weapon of preference is the hammer-wammer!${prompt}
  4274: Only real men use hammers!${prompt}
  4275: I wonder if I athk Mommy nithely, she'll make me a weapon?${prompt}
  4276: The ultimate killing machine would be cool, but a pretty staff of tranthformation would altho be thweet...${prompt}
  4277: |-
    Grrrowl...
    I don't need no weapons!${prompt}
  4278: My claws and teeth arrre my weapons! Cat Burrrglar! Hearrr my roarrr!${prompt}
  4279: Well, I betterrr preparrre lots of tools too, if we're gonna catch the Cat Burglarrr!${prompt}
  4280: Firrrst I'll get a fishing net! Fishing nets rrreek of fish, so the Cat Burrrglar will be overrrcome by the smell and walk rrright into it!${prompt}
  4281: |-
    Well done!
    Now we can put our plan into action! Off to the ghosty house we go!${prompt}
  4282: 'But, before we set out...I had better make my special stink-bombs out of these ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  4283: You know the way to the ghosty house, right? Then get your own weapons and equipment in order, and wait for us there!${prompt}
  4284: Hey newbie, what kept you? We ended up losing sight of the Cat Burglar.${prompt}
  4285: It's all Pichichi's fault. If only she hadn't have scrrreamed and woken herrr up!${prompt}
  4286: And just when we had the Cat Burglar-wurglar in our grasp, too...${prompt}
  4287: But, I wath thuprithed to find thith...${prompt}
  4288: Wow! What is it?${prompt}
  4289: Cool! It's a treasure-weasure!${prompt}
  4290: Let us have a closerrr look!${prompt}
  4291: I know what dat ball is! Dat's a Mana Orb! It's da heart of a Cardian!${prompt}
  4292: But Mana Orbs are closely contwolled by da people in charge of da Cardian workshop in da Manustewy! For it to be lying awound dere must mean dat da Cat Burglar had it in her possession...!${prompt}
  4293: I smell a rat...or in this case, a cat! She must have stolen it from somewhere! We're onto something big here!${prompt}
  4294: Next time that Cat Burglar sneaks into the ghosty house, we'll nab her for good!${prompt}
  4295: |-
    What?
    Don't we have to return the Mana Orb to the Manustery?${prompt}
  4296: No way! This is very important evidence we have here! Proof that the Cat Burglar committed a crime!${prompt}
  4297: |-
    <huff><puff>
    Ha... Hah...
    I'm exhausted!${prompt}
  4298: We oughta check into dat ghosty house a little more...${prompt}
  4299: But we don't know how much of what gwown-ups tell us is twue or just stowies. No one can twust adults in dis sad world of ours!${prompt}
  4300: When I saw the Cat Burglar's tail waving about all to-and-fro as she ran away, my eyes began to spinny-winny. That's why she was able to get away from me!${prompt}
  4301: We're not so good at magic-wagic yet, so I don't have a cluey-wuey how a ball like that could make a Cardian move.${prompt}
  4302: |-
    It's all Pichichi's fault. Who else could it be?
    Arrrgh!${prompt}
  4303: We might have the evidence, but it's useless while the Cat Burrrglar is still at larrrge!${prompt}
  4304: Anyway, we had betterrr stow the Mana Orrrb safely away somewherrre. Leave the guarrrding job to me!${prompt}
  4305: The Cat Burrrglar got away again! Eeew, I'm so frrrustrrrated!${prompt}
  4306: The Cat Burglarrr got away again! Eeew, I'm so frrrustrrrated!${prompt}
  4307: But I bet she's looking high and low forrr herrr prrrecious Mana Orrrb! Hee-hee-hee... Rrrevenge is so sweet!${prompt}
  4308: '......${prompt}'
  4309: I wonder if mithuth Cat Burglar ith angry? Did Pichichi do thomething bad?${prompt}
  4310: Did you really-weally have a showdown with the Cat Burglar?${prompt}
  4311: Why don't you guys let me join in all the fun? Ohww, I'm always left out!${prompt}
  4312: |-
    O～h, you're late, as usual!
    Quickly, to fill you in on what you missed, well...something terrible happened!${prompt}
  4313: The Cat Burglar came by a moment ago and tried to scare us into returning the Mana Orb to her.${prompt}
  4314: She said it was too dangerous for the likes of us, 'cause some evil Cardians are after it! But we weren't fooled by her!${prompt}
  4315: She tried hard to break us, but we stood our ground until she gave up and sulked away! We won again! Yippee!${prompt}
  4316: But then something funny happened. When we checked the box we kept the Mana Orb in, it was empty! So, we're all wondering where-oh-where has our little Mana Orb gone?${prompt}
  4317: Now I propose we go hunt down the criminal! So how about you then? Are you in on it, too?${prompt}
  4318: |-
    Help catch the criminal?
    ${selection-lines}
    Cooperate.
    Get real!${prompt}
  4319: |-
    Oh! That can only mean one thing...
    You did it!
    You're the criminal!${prompt}
  4320: |-
    A-ha-ha... Just kidding!
    But if you keep up the wet blanket act, we'll kick you out of our Star Onion Brigade! I'm warning you!${prompt}
  4321: Said like a true Star Onion! We superheroes never let baddies get away with their crimes!${prompt}
  4322: |-
    So, getting down to business...
    In order to catch the criminal we'll need the seven gadgets found in the Junior Investigator's Toolkit!${prompt}

  4330: Hmm...but that's just as bad as a robber? Oh well, then again, who cares about the minor points...?${prompt}
  4331: We'll be needing a lamp if we arrre going into darrrk places!${prompt}

  4342: Tho when I heard Kohlo-Lakolo wath going to give it away to thomebody, I dethided to thecretly hide it!${prompt}
  4343: So, it was Pichichi who took it and hid it away! Well, chalk up another one to the Star Onion Brigade, 'cause it looks like this mystery is also solved!${prompt}
  4344: Thith mythtery ith altho tholved!${prompt}
  4345: I was forgetting that this Mana Orb is a priceless treasure of our Star Onion Brigade.${prompt}
  4346: After all, it's the first spoils we ever took from that Cat Burglar!${prompt}

  4356: It's all Pichichi's fault. I don't know why I hang out with this bunch of fools!${prompt}
  4357: The culprit is always the one you least suspect. I know 'cause I've read almost every one of the Agatha Crystalie mystery series. So you can leave this case to me.${prompt}
  4358: What do you mean, they've already solved “The Case of the Missing Mana Orb”? But the great detective Shanruru didn't get to make her appearance!? Ohww, they always leave me out!${prompt}
  4359: It seems as if the Cat Burglar has been coming and going in and out of the ghosty house!${prompt}
  4360: We should be investigating what she's up to in there, but that haunted house has a magic lock placed on its doors!${prompt}
  4361: I hear if we had the minister's ring we could unlock the place, but we can't just run up to Doctor Koru-Moru and borrow it from him, can we...?${prompt}

  4364: |-
    Everybody listen up here!
    The time for us to catch the Cat Burglar has come! We can now open the doors to the ghosty house!${prompt}
  4365: Let's go to the ghosty house before the Cat Burglar gets away! C'mon, move it, move it!${prompt}
  4366: The ring that you found was probably the previous Minister of the Optistery's ring. So long as we have this, we can handle any magic that the Optistery can throw at us.${prompt}
  4367: Let's go to the ghosty house and nab that Cat Burglar once and for all! C'mon, move it, move it!${prompt}
  4368: Ah! That's a little old, but it looks like the minister's ring. Oh, and I've seen that insignia somewhere... That's the ghosty house's mark!${prompt}
  4369: So you've found the key at last! Too bad we won't be needing it anymore...${prompt}
  4370: You see, while you were away, we heard news that the Cat Burglar had entered into the ghosty house. So naturally, we all headed straight to the crime scene!${prompt}
  4371: |-
    Pretty cool, huh?
    If only you had come by earlier, you could have been part of the action. But, oh well, too bad!${prompt}

  4373: Hey, how come you didn't come with us to the ghosty house? What, were you too afraid, or something?${prompt}
  4374: |-
    Well we went!
    And we had a totally wild experience. You see...${prompt}
  4375: |-
    Hee-hee-hee! Pretty cool, huh?
    It's the Star Onion Brigade's greatest adventure yet!${prompt}
  4376: |-
    Oh, and what we told you just now has to be kept a secret from the grown-ups, okay?
    ♪Cross you heart and hope to die, stick Cactuar needles in your eye?♪${prompt}

  4387: Pichichi brought Joker back here with her, so we made him a member of the Star Onion Brigade.${prompt}
  4388: But you better keep it a secret from the other grown-ups. Cardians are under the control of the Manustery. If they find out about him, they'll take him away from us!${prompt}
  4389: We've got dat Cardian, Joker, hiding away.${prompt}
  4390: If any gwown-ups find him, dey'll take him away to the Manustewy. We can't allow dat to happen...not until we solve Joker's mystewy.${prompt}

    Cardians are so strangey-wangey.

  11445: You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!${prompt}

    The effects of controlling regions.

    Regions under beastman control.${prompt}
  11936: All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt}
  11937: Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt}
  11938: Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt}
  11939: So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt}
  11940: |-
    Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.
    They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt}
  11941: Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt}
  11942: Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt}
  11943: |-
    So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.
    We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt}
  11944: |-
    You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.
    Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt}
  11945: |-
    Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.
    The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt}

    You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.

    We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.

    You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.
    Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt}
  11949: Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt}

  11952: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt}
  11953: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt}
  11954: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt}
  11955: Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt}
  11956: Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt}
  11957: Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt}
  11958: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt}
  11959: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt}
  11960: |-
    Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.
    If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt}
  11961: If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt}
  11962: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt}
  11963: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt}
  11964: There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt}
  11965: |-
    Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.

  12272: Speaking of which, wasn't your verrry first mission with the Orastery?${prompt}
  12273: What was that experrriment all about, anyway? What was the rrreason behind rrreawakening the magic in the Sarutabaruta towers?${prompt}

    Oh, you're finally here!
    The minister has been antsy-wantsy waiting for you!${prompt}
  12279: |-
    You're late!
    Everything is nearly ready to go.${prompt}
  12280: Are you listening? I wantaru you to go under the southwestern tower in West Sarutabaruta and press the switch in the laboratory.${prompt}
  12281: |-
    That's the lastaru one.
    If all goes well, the magic towers will be activated!${prompt}
  12282: Wait! Minister!?${prompt}
  12283: Well, it's like the minister said--head to the southwestern tower in West Sarutabaruta and entaru the laboratory.${prompt}
  12284: 'This ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} is the key to the laboratory.${prompt}'
  12285: I'd always believed thataru the minister would restore the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt}
  12286: '...But, I wonder if the towers will really become active again? We''ve used oodles and oodles of Mana Orbs and dug deep into the Orastery''s budgetaru for this project...${prompt}'
  12287: As I'm sure you remember, it is forbidden to tamper with the Horutoto Ruins withoutaru permission from Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  12288: |-
    Our minister has been scolded repeatedly by the Sibyl Guards over his blatantaru disregard for this rule.
    ...It's a tense situation.${prompt}
  12289: Minister Ajido-Marujido said he was heading for the central tower of the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt}
  12290: Could you go and find him in the underground complex and bring him backy-wack for us? Tell him the Sibyl Guards really have their hackles up this time.${prompt}
  12291: |-
    This is terrible-werrible.
    Semih Lafihna came asking about the mission.${prompt}
  12292: Of course, we explained the mission in a round-a-bout-a-wout way... But she seems to have found outaru the details from some other source.${prompt}
  12293: Heeber-jeebers!${prompt}
  12294: |-
    What are we going to do!
    The minister has been caughtaru red-handed! ${prompt}
  12295: |-
    We need to stay calm and think.
    With no leader for the Mage Academy, an attack from another nation or a beastman army would turn Windurst into rubble-wubble.${prompt}
  12296: If that happens, then we should have Doctor Shantotto on the frontaru line... No wait, we need Doctor Shantotto to be Windurst's lastaru line of defense...${prompt}
  12297: |-
    Be careful, now!
    This is a magic training area.
    It's far too dangerous for your average Joe Blow to be hanging around here!${prompt}
  12298: Now especially-wecially, everyone is a little on edge. Since the minister was arrested by the Sibyl Guards, the Orastery has been completely topsy-turvy.${prompt}
  12299: Whatever is going to happen to our beloved Orastery? I shudder-wudder to think...${prompt}
  12300: We've practiced-a-wacticed our fingers to the bone on this high-level magic... It seems the day has finally come where we can put it to the testaru!${prompt}
  12301: Naturally, we Orastery mages are going to break the minister outaru of the Dark Dungeon. The Orastery is invince-a-bubble!${prompt}
  12302: I, I, I'm a newcomer to the Orastery. I, I, I used to dream of becoming like the greataru and respectarued hero, Karaha-Baruha, but lately I've thought about being a little m-m-more sinister, like Minister Ajido-Marujido.${prompt}
  12303: A-a-although, I wouldn't wantaru be thrown into the Dark Dungeon. Oh, Minister Ajido-Marujido! Y-y-you're justaru a little too sinister!${prompt}
  12304: |-
    ...What a miserable situation...
    This is the most desperate time in the Orastery's history.${prompt}
  12305: |-
    Actually, come to think of it there was a time worse than now. It was the time when Doctor Shantotto was minister here...
    I get cold chills just thinking about it...${prompt}
  12306: |-
    There ain't enuff War Warlocks for us to fight a war right now.
    Afta' all, it's only been twenty-odd years since the last one...${prompt}
  12307: |-
    Even with all this goin' on, they're thinking of throwing every one of us, even the minister, into the Dark Dungeon!
    If a war does start, what will 'appen, the Goddess only knows...${prompt}
  12308: |-
    Did you hear, did you hear?
    This is justaru between you and me, but...${prompt}
  12309: Minister Ajido-Marujido was finally arrested by the Sibyl Guards!${prompt}
  12310: |-
    The Orastery is in a whole lot of trouble-wouble.
    ...We guards are affected by this as well, of course, but the mages of the Orastery are in a completaru state of shock.${prompt}
  12311: |-
    ...Ah, ahem.
    I would like to chataru a little more but you have been summoned to Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  12312: This is an order from the Star Sibyl, so please make your way to Heavens Tower as quickly as possible.${prompt}
  12313: |-
    Minister Apururu is Minister Ajido-Marujido's little sister, rightaru?
    I wonder what she thinks of all this?${prompt}
  12314: Ahem, anyway, please hurry on over to Heavens Tower. The Star Sibyl will be waiting for you.${prompt}

    I guess they weren't kidding.${prompt}
  12320: Where is this Dark Dungeon, anyway? I've haven't seen it anywhere in town.${prompt}
  12321: Hi there, I have a mission-wission from the Optistery for you to tidy up the book vault.${prompt}
  12322: With all the ruckus-wuckus around here you wouldn't think the ministries would be issuing missions right now. You gottaru hand it to the Optistery, nothing upsets their routine!${prompt}
  12323: With Minister Tosuka-Porika's dislike of Ajido-Marujido though, I guess he's feeling on top of the world about what happened.${prompt}
  12324: The Optistery's missions are always difficultaru, but try your bestaru!${prompt}

  12331: When it comes down to it, there are so many incidents that occur rrright under our whiskers.${prompt}
  12332: '...Does this mean that even worse things are happening that we just don''t know about?${prompt}'
  12333: |-
    Step right up! Get your missions here!
    ...Ahem. This mission has been issued by the Rhinostery.${prompt}
  12334: It says here that the Rhinostery needs a handy-wandy with something but there are no specific details. They're probably looking for a research assistantaru.${prompt}
  12335: Take yourself to the second floor of the Rhinostery and getaru the low-down from Leepe-Hoppe.${prompt}
  12336: The mission statement is about as clear as mud, but if you talk to Leepe-Hoppe at the Rhinostery he should provide you with all the details.${prompt}
  12337: I wonder why the Rhinostery would be enlisting research assistantarus by issuing a mission? Usually they just employ one of the Rhinostery-affiliated adventurers...${prompt}

  12344: This is a little late, but congratulations on reaching rank eight!${prompt}
  12345: Well, this is surprising. Your next mission is from the Aurastery. As usual, the teachers from the School of Magic are the ones to set this little task...${prompt}
  12346: The objective of this mission is strictaruly confidential, but since it has the Sibyl guards stamp of approval it should be okay.${prompt}
  12347: Rightaru, time to get to work!${prompt}
  12348: |-
    You can ask the details of the mission from the teachers at the Aurastery.
    There mustaru have been some sort of trouble.${prompt}

    Rightaru!
    I've finally plucked up my courage, so listen carefully before I lose my nerve.${prompt}

  12368: We won't be able to keep up this charrrade forever, so get it over and done with as quickly as possible.${prompt}
  12369: I heard the story from Minister Apururu and Professor Shantotto. You risked all sorts of hazards and hardships to rescue our minister.${prompt}
  12370: I wanted to assist you, no mattaru the cost. Without the minister, I wouldn't be where I am today.${prompt}
  12371: As for the minister's condition...there's nothing wrong with his physical health, but his mind is being held in thrall by an unknown force.${prompt}
  12372: |-
    Minister Apururu was stammering so much she could hardly speak, but it seems something unexpected transpired at the Dark Dungeon.
    ...With both Minister Apururu and Professor Shantotto here, we shouldn't have anything to worry about, though...${prompt}
  12373: Oh, you startled me!${prompt}
  12374: |-
    Thank you so much!
    I was so worried, my tummy-wummy was doing somersaults.${prompt}
  12375: |-
    Take this with my thanks.
    Now I have to get this wand fixed!${prompt}
  12376: |-
    Thank you!
    Now I have to get this wand fixed!${prompt}
  12377: The Orastery sometimes has visits from Professor Shantotto, and it was she who saw through the deception. After a single glance at the new wand, the professor blew her top at Hakkuru-Rinkuru.${prompt}
  12378: That's just not true, Kuroido-Moroido. She didn't get mad at all... And that's why it's so distressing.${prompt}
  12379: Everyone knows how acid-tongued Professor Shantotto is. That very same professor said this to me.${prompt}
  12380: “That wand was passed down to Ajido-Marujido from his mother and he holds it very dear to his heart. I pity you, poor Hakkuru-Rinkuru. You'll probably get yourself snapped in half as well!”${prompt}
  12381: |-
    Oh Goddess!
    I don't want to be snapped in half!${prompt}
  12382: Come on Hakkuru-Rinkuru, cheer up. When Minister Ajido-Marujido gets back, we'll apologize to him together.${prompt}
  12383: No! Apologizing won't do any good. It'll just be “snap!”, and then me lying there in two pieces!${prompt}
  12384: What a lucky break. With Minister Ajido-Marujido in the Dark Dungeon, this wand'll be the least of his worries...${prompt}
  12385: |-
    Oh Goddess!
    The last time Professor Shantotto was here, she took one look at me and said this.${prompt}
  12386: “That wand was passed down to Ajido-Marujido from his mother and he holds it very dear to his heart. I pity you, poor Hakkuru-Rinkuru. You'll probably get yourself snapped in half as well!”${prompt}
  12387: |-
    Hello, everyone!
    Apururu is here!${wait-animation: 1}
  12388: |-
    Hello!
    ...Oh? Have I interrupted something?${prompt}
  12389: |-
    No, not at all.
    You seem out of breath, Minister Apururu... Are you here on urgentaru business?${prompt}
  12390: |-
    No, not particularly.
    Professor Shantotto was at the Manustery today and mentioned that I might want to visit the Orastery from time to time and see how things are going.${prompt}
  12391: I thought at first that maybe she was just concerned about everyone here at the Orastery...${prompt}
  12392: But that seems unlikely coming from Professor Shantotto. So I figured there must be some other reason for me to come here.${prompt}
  12393: Everything appears to be in order though, so I guess I'll be going. Ta-taru～.${prompt}
  12394: |-
    Now I see what's going on.
    Hakkuru-Rinkuru, you've been completely taken in by Professor Shantotto.${prompt}
  12395: She knew all about the history of that wand. What a meanie-beanie, malicious-wicious person she is.${prompt}
  12396: '...Let me see...${prompt}'
  12397: This should do it...${prompt}
  12398: If Miss Apururu hadn't come along when she did, you would be on your way to the Gates of Paradise by now.${prompt}
  12399: Professor Shantotto!${prompt}
  12400: '...That''s not the problem here!${prompt}'
  12401: |-
    Now, now. No need to get so agitated. The situation is not that tragic.
    You're one lucky adventurer to have Minister Apururu to tend to you after having a taste of my magic.${prompt}
  12402: '...Just because my brother isn''t here, doesn''t mean you can go around endangering adventurers willy-nilly!${prompt}'
  12403: No matter how desperate the Orastery is for mages, you don't have the right to use adventurers for experiments. You should know better!${prompt}
  12404: It wasn't for an experiment. The brigadier generals were bickering over the Orastery's budget...${prompt}
  12405: We had gathered the three wands that the brigadier generals wanted and we were comparing their quality. Then when Professor Shantotto showed up, all this happened...${prompt}
  12406: The next budget...?${prompt}
  12407: That's just what I wanted to talk to you about. Since he couldn't get in touch with Ajido-Marujido, a shopkeeper in Jeuno contacted me about my brother's purchases.${prompt}
  12408: My brother has already used next year's budget. He's bought swords, axes, armor, shields...${prompt}
  12409: |-
    Huh!? Wait just a momentaru!
    None of those things can be equipped by mages...???${prompt}
  12410: Oh, they're not for the mages to use, they're for research purposes apparently. Ajido-Marujido must've have bought them for you boys here in Operations.${prompt}
  12411: '...Well, that''s all I came over for, so I guess it''s ta-taru for me! Have fun with your research!${prompt}'
  12412: |-
    What are we gonna do?
    My head is all jumble-wumbled up.${prompt}
  12413: |-
    Ah, you there!
    You must do something to help the Star Onion Brigade!${prompt}
  12414: The rich old geezer living in Windurst Waters told us to give back the Mana Orb we got from Nanaa Mihgo!${prompt}
  12415: He said that the Mana Orb belonged to him.${prompt}
  12416: He also said that if we don't give it back, he'll get the boss-woss from the Manustery onto us! We're getting framed as a gang of villain-willains!${prompt}
  12417: '...But our weal pwoblem is dat we don''t got da Mana Orb no more.${prompt}'
  12418: Do you wemember? Dat Mana Orb got all sucked up into Joker's body.${prompt}
  12419: That's rrright. Even if we wanted to, we couldn't give it back.${prompt}
  12420: But that old fuddy-duddy won't listen to a word we say!${prompt}
  12421: '......${prompt}'
  12422: So now we're really deep in dhalmel doo-doo. The Star Onion Brigade will go from being heroes to zeroes!${prompt}
  12423: You're a famous adventurer, aren't you? Can't you think of anything to help us?${prompt}
  12424: That rich old geezer living in Windurst Waters told us to give back his Mana Orb.${prompt}
  12425: |-
    What are we gonna do?
    My head is all jumble-wumbled up.${prompt}
  12426: I've heard that that old miser is a rrreal meanie.${prompt}

  12428: The Star Onion Brigade is not a gang of villain-willains!${prompt}
  12429: That Mana Orb belongs to Joker. It got sucked right into him like it was a perfect fit! It must be his!${prompt}
  12430: Da old rich guy dat lives in Windurst Waters is called Honoi-Gomoi, I think.${prompt}
  12431: His ancestors were supposed to be a bunch of whiz-bang wizards, so dat's why he's so rich now.${prompt}
  12432: If he's got all that money, then he doesn't need the Mana Orb!${prompt}
  12433: Only Cardians rrreally need Mana Orbs! Wait, does that mean the old guy is actually a Cardian?${prompt}
  12434: They thay that Honoi-Gomoi ith a bad man 'cos hith grandfather'th, grandfather'th, grandfather wath a bad man too.${prompt}
  12435: |-
    It'th very confuthing, but it'th the truth.

  12436: |-
    The Star Onion Brigade is gonna take on a grown-up?
    Ohww, they always leave me out!${prompt}
  12437: If they keep leaving me out of things, I'm gonna be a grown-up myself soon! And then who am I supposed to play with!?${prompt}
  12438: What happened? You went to the old geezer's place?${prompt}
  12439: |-
    ...Hmmm.
    A complete waste of time, huh? All that guy can say is “Give it back! Give it back!”${prompt}
  12440: |-
    Rightaru, we need to come up with a plan!
    Time for an emergency strategy meeting!${prompt}
  12441: Um, order in the court!${prompt}
  12442: |-
    Let's think of what we can do about Honoi-Gomoi's Mana Orb!
    Does anybody have any ideas?${prompt}
  12443: Let's tell him it was gobble-wobbled up by a dhamel in Windurst Woods!${prompt}
  12444: |-
    That's no good.
    We should say it fell into the ocean!${prompt}
  12445: I don't think a grown-up is gonna fall for dat kind of thing.${prompt}
  12446: You all know it. Adults are too smart for simple excuses.${prompt}
  12447: |-
    I've got it!
    We can give him a fake Mana Orb!${prompt}
  12448: |-
    A fake Mana Orb...
    But how would we make one?${prompt}
  12449: |-
    ...It'th wrong.
    It'th wrong to tell lieth and trick people.${prompt}
  12450: Pichichi!${prompt}
  12451: The Thtar Onion Brigade isn't about lying or tricking people! It was formed to fight people like that.${prompt}

    You're right!
    The Star Onion Brigade stands for justice!${prompt}

    What am I going to do...?
    What should we do, ${name-player}?${prompt}

    What a selfish old meanie!
    Just because he's rrrich doesn't mean he can go around doing whatever he wants!${prompt}

    Huh.
    I never would've thought of taking Joker to pieces.${prompt}
  12461: Adults always think of the most horrible-worrible things first.${prompt}
  12462: I've done some digging on our Mr. Honoi-Gomoi. He's always saying tewwible things, but actually he seems wike a weally nice guy.${prompt}
  12463: I found out dat during the Gweat War, he helped pay for twansporting suppwies and for we-building Windurst.${prompt}
  12464: After digging a wittle more, I discovered da weason why people call Mr. Honoi-Gomoi a bad man.${prompt}
  12465: He organized things so dat da money he lent to Windurst during da war would come back to him as even more money.${prompt}
  12466: People whisper dat he used da war as a way of becoming even more rich.${prompt}
  12467: If we come acrrross Joker, we can't tell him any of this.${prompt}
  12468: It would be such a shock for him. If it was me, I'd be crrrying into my milk...${prompt}
  12469: They thay that Honoi-Gomoi ith a bad perthon 'cos hith grandmother'th, grandmother'th, grandmother wath a bad perthon too.${prompt}

    Huh? Grandmother?
    It wath hith grandmother right?${prompt}
  12471: I can't diss-a-sem-bull Joker, I just can't!${prompt}
  12472: On your Star Onion Brigade honor, you can't tell anybody that Joker is hiding in the ghosty house!${prompt}
  12473: |-
    ......
    Going to the ghosty house brings back a lot of memories about Joker.${prompt}
  12474: Joker...${prompt}
  12475: |-
    ...I just can't do it!
    There's just no way I can take Joker to pieces!${prompt}
  12476: But even if you don't do it, you can bet dat old meanie will find another way to dis-a-sem-bull Joker...${prompt}
  12477: Once he finds out where Joker is, he'll probably hire an adventurer!${prompt}
  12478: Who knows what he'll do! How can we stop him?${prompt}
  12479: '...Hey, I know. Why don''t we take Joker so far away that Honoi-Gomoi will never-ever find him?${prompt}'
  12480: Even furtherer away than San d'Oria or Bastok. Somewhere where even adventurers are afraid to go.${prompt}
  12481: Yeah! That's a great idea!${prompt}
  12482: But dat plan is gonna be awful hard for us to carry out.${prompt}
  12483: First we need to find a way to get Joker out of Windurst without anybody noticing.${prompt}
  12484: |-
    You're rrright.
    If we can't fool the gatehouse guards, Joker will be caught before we can get anywhere!${prompt}
  12485: |-
    Exactaruly.
    It makes it difficult with Joker being a Cardian.${prompt}
  12486: Da gatehouse checks have been much stwicter since a bunch of Cardians kidnapped da old Manustery minister.${prompt}
  12487: Joker is one of the good Cardians, but the grown-ups won't understand even if we try to explain.${prompt}

  12497: Joker's hiding spot in da House of da Hero is tip-top secwet information.${prompt}
  12498: You never know when someone may be wistening, so don't mention it to your friends, your family, or even your pet worms!${prompt}
  12499: Pichichi's mommy has a hostel in Windurst Waters, rrright?${prompt}
  12500: But before she started her business, she trrraveled all around Vana'diel. Does that mean Pichichi's mommy used to be an adventurer?${prompt}
  12501: We're not gonna let anyone hurrrt our Joker!${prompt}
  12502: Joker is a member of the Star Onion Brigade! No matter the danger, we don't abandon our frrriends!${prompt}

  12504: He thaid he wath going on patrol, tho I gueth he'th traveling all over the plathe. Thoundth like fun.${prompt}
  12505: I wonder why Honoi-Gomoi wants that particular Mana Orb so much?${prompt}

  12545: I'm glad little Shanruru is okay. After today, we should make her a full member of the Star Onion Brigade.${prompt}
  12546: Was Joker rrreally friends with those bad Cardians? He didn't seem like a bad Cardian at all.${prompt}
  12547: Did he go with those Cardians even though he didn't want to? If that's the case, we have to go rrrescue him!${prompt}
  12548: |-
    Wowzie-powzie!
    Those bad guy Cardians were totally intimidating! They were way more scary than Nanaa-Mihgo!${prompt}

  12648: I entrustaru this club to you, and ask that you smacky-whack away until its magical power has been depleted.${prompt}

  12650: As opposed to the reckless-weckless organizer of this event, who's likely to charge in flailing a staff with both hands...${prompt}

  12657: Please disposey-wose of the club so you won't be connected with the goings-on here at the Orastery.${prompt}
  12658: We have a splendid-wendid reward for you after your task is done. Don'taru give up, now!${prompt}

  12862: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  12863: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  12864: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  12865: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  12866: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  12867: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  12868: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  12869: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  12870: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  12871: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  12872: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  12873: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  12874: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  12875: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  12876: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  12877: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  12878: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  12879: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  12880: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  12881: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  12882: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  12883: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  12884: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'
  12885: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt}
  12886: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  12887: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  12888: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}

    Hmph! You dang kids these days ain't got no respect for your elders. Can't you see I'm tryin' to learn this new fandangled fishin' method? In my day, all we had to do was cast a line and wait for the baby to tug. Why, back then it was so easy, I could catch fish while I was sleepin'!${prompt}

  12996: Now, once you feel the pull is where the real battle begins--and I say battle because that fish is not going to let you get him without a fight! If he starts tuggin' to the left, you've gotta pull to the right. If he starts tuggin' to the right, you've gotta pull to the left.${prompt}
  12997: 'Keepin'' centered--that''s the key to tirin'' out that old puppy! And once you think you''ve softened him up enough, that''s when you reel him in. If you ${color: 5}confirm${color: 1} a little too early, the fish may still have enough pep to run off with your bait. But if you spend too much time playin'' with him, he might just get bored and be on his way.${prompt}'
  12998: 'Of course, if you ever get a bad feeling that whatever''s on the end of your line''s fixin'' to snap your rod in two, you could always ${color: 5}cancel${color: 1} your way out of things......sissy!${prompt}'
  12999: |-
    Alright, did you get all that? Well, keep listenin', 'cause I'm not done yet.
    This new type o' fishin' works differently with different types of rods.${prompt}
  13000: Those fancy carbon and glass rods may have what it takes to keep a fish on your line for a long time, but the flexibility of good old-fashioned wooden rods packs enough punch to tire out any fish in the blink of an eye.${prompt}

  13002: A little while back, the Fishermen's Guild's ship party was crashed by a trio of wandering comedians.${prompt}

  13116: Okay, adventurer. Grandpa told me to tell you this...${prompt}
  13117: The sable spirit of Diabolos looms in your wake.${prompt}
  13118: Just as the ruler of dreams extends his nebulous arms to emancipate the righteous, you too harbor within your heart the strength to remain calm in dire straits, and lead those lambs who have strayed into the abyss to the light of victory.${prompt}
  13119: In other words, he's saying you're a born leader! Why, shouldn't you be out gathering a party and giving orders, or something?${prompt}
  13120: Oh, and he also says that even though you may have the makings of a great ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman], people will never follow you unless you tack some “bravery” and “drive” onto your resume. Go figure!${prompt}
  13121: The scintillant spirit of Carbuncle hovers above you.${prompt}
  13122: And just as the delicate ruby light from the bringer of rainbows soothes the weary soul, so too does the soft, warm radiance that shines forth from your heart unto those in need.${prompt}
  13123: In other words, he's saying you're always nice to people. You know, helping them out with their problems and stuff. If you're not already a white mage, maybe you should think of a profession change.${prompt}
  13124: Oh, and he also says that the only way that people will ever respect you is if you help them without expecting something in return. Kind of like helping a kid get a New Year's gift without wanting some kind of reward when you're done, wouldn't you say?${prompt}
  13125: The dynamic spirit of Ramuh walks by your side.${prompt}
  13126: Just as the world glows with his electric wisdom, your mind too glows with an infinite intelligence that sends shudders of excitement and awe throughout the masses.${prompt}
  13127: In other words, you're a smart ${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady] who is chock full of curiosity and is always looking for a change. You wouldn't happen to be a red mage, would you?${prompt}
  13128: Oh, and he also says that if you would just pay a little more attention to those around you, people might not say all that bad stuff behind your back. Go figure!${prompt}
  13129: The lofty spirit of Titan towers above you.${prompt}
  13130: Just as his adamantine will shields the meager from destitution, you too tread the path of life with caution while providing sanctuary for all souls who gather in the warmth of your heart.${prompt}
  13131: In other words, you think before you act, unlike those creeps who shoot first and ask questions the next Firesday. Your ability to quickly identify an enemy's weak point and finish him off before he hurts your friends makes you good black mage material.${prompt}
  13132: Oh, and he also says that if you were only a little more honest, then people might respect you more than they do that guy at the chocobo stables who sells everybody the gysahl greens with the bugs in 'em.${prompt}
  13133: The whispering spirit of Garuda whisks about you.${prompt}
  13134: Just as the avatar of wind roams free across the never-ending skies of Vana'diel, so too does your lucid heart yearn to break free of the chains that bind it to conformity.${prompt}
  13135: In other words, he's saying that you were born to be an adventurer, and that your free spirit would make you a mighty good thief, if there is such thing as a good thief.${prompt}
  13136: Oh, and he also says that you'd be a lot more popular if you'd stop trying to impress everyone and just be yourself. Go figure!${prompt}
  13137: The lustrous spirit of Leviathan watches over you.${prompt}
  13138: Just as the radiant visage of the guardian of seas renders vapid souls breathless, the pristine balance between your attention to beauty and respect for harmony are the waves upon which your companions cast their vessels.${prompt}
  13139: In other words, that “pristine balance” helps you from being swayed by the poison opinions of others, and grants you good judgment in sticky situations. Add to that all that talk about harmony, and it sounds to me like you'd make a good bard.${prompt}
  13140: Oh, and he also says that if you'd stop worrying about what you wear on the outside and concentrated more on polishing what's inside, people might actually stop avoiding you. Go figure!${prompt}
  13141: The chilling spirit of Shiva shadows your soul.${prompt}
  13142: And just as her veil of hoarfrost hides the world from the eyes of men, you too don a shroud of discretion as you journey alone through the valleys of solitude.${prompt}
  13143: In other words, he's saying that you're a calm, cool, and collected player who has an answer for all the challenges life throws at you. Sounds like blue mage material to me!${prompt}
  13144: Oh, and he also said that if you'd stop picking out people's faults and concentrate on what they've got on the inside, maybe you'll learn what true friendship is. Ouch!${prompt}
  13145: The searing spirit of Ifrit walks alongside you.${prompt}
  13146: Just as the inferno within his soul spits forth flames of undying emotion, the fire deep in your heart burns with the passion and determination to face any challenge.${prompt}
  13147: In other words, once you've set your mind on something, a bucket full of pamama au lait ain't gonna stop you from charging in the room and unloading your quiver of bloody bolts on anything that stands in your way. Sounds like a grade-A warrior to me.${prompt}
  13148: Oh, and he also said that if you would start being a little more decisive, people would stop refusing to be in your party because they thought it was going to take you three days to decide on a place to camp lesser colibri. Go figure!${prompt}
  13149: The daunting spirit of Odin stands alert at your side.${prompt}
  13150: Just as the mighty conqueror's ambition drives him to Victory's bosom, so too does the harmony within your heart guide stray souls to the paths they seek.${prompt}
  13151: In other words, he's saying that your belief in your faith, along with your hating of all that is wrong, keeps your heart pure--pure enough to endure the trials of a paladin.${prompt}
  13152: Oh, and he also says that you're actually really sensitive, but too ashamed to show people your true feelings, so you pent them all up inside. You'd better fix that or you'll find yourself battling some nasty ulcers. Cheers!${prompt}
  13153: The noble spirit of Fenrir guards your shadows.${prompt}
  13154: Just as the guardian of the moon's light drives darkness from the kingdom of night, you follow the sun across land and sky, from dawn until dusk, from birth until death. You see the world on a scale that dwarfs even the mightiest of mountains and their snow-laden peaks.${prompt}
  13155: In other words, he's saying that you're always in search of a good time, and are always up to speed with the latest fads and fashions. Maybe you should think about being a corsair or a puppetmaster. Come on! Everyone's doing it!${prompt}
  13156: Oh, and he also said that your refusal to act normal every now and then freaks a lot of people out. Keep that in mind before you go running down to the auction house wearing only your subligar.${prompt}
  13157: The mighty spirit of Bahamut hovers above you.${prompt}
  13158: Just as the Wyrmking rules the skies with his mere presence, so too do you stand above lesser men with your distinct aura of fortune and conviction.${prompt}
  13159: In other words, he's saying that by combining the logic and ideals that clutter your brain with a little of the luck that saves your lazy bum all the time, you'd have the power to summon great power...like a summoner!${prompt}
  13160: Oh, and he also says that if you'd stop trying so hard and rely a little more on the smiles that Fortune keeps wafting your way, people might actually think you're competent. Go figure!${prompt}
  13161: |-
    Uh-huh...
    Uh-huh...
    Yeah, ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] looks really pleased with your answer.${prompt}
  13162: |-
    You want me to tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] that, too? Alright.
    Grandpa says that all journeys begin with faith in oneself. Take a good look at what lurks inside before stepping out...${prompt}
  13163: Whatever that means. I don't understand half the stuff he says, but I like him because he gives me candy.${prompt}
  13164: |-
    I knew it. You adventurers are all alike.
    Here, take this. It was getting sweaty in my pocket anyway.${prompt}
  13165: You want to know about Grandpa? Actually, I don't know if I can tell you much.${prompt}
  13166: He comes to visit sometimes, and gives me presents, but he never says where he's traveled from or where he's going.${prompt}
  13167: Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about being somewhere high up where he could see for malms...${prompt}

  13389: The Vana'diel Chocobo Society, or VCS for short, is an international organization designed to train and dispatch chocogirls and chocoguys to stables across Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13390: They provide courses on practical chocobo riding and the proper ways to care for a chocobo, as well as working to improve the treatment of chocobos from here to Aht Urhgan.${prompt}

  13392: Chicks hatch from eggs, grow into young chocobos, and finally mature.${prompt}
  13393: They grow much faster than people do. Usually it takes about 1 month (Earth time) before you can ride your chocobo.${prompt}
  13394: The chocobo's traits are determined by the way in which you care for your animal. Without proper planning, you won't be able to raise the type of chocobo that you want.${prompt}

  13397: “Strength” is a term used to describe the chocobo's leg power. The more strength a chocobo has, the faster it will be able to run. Rental chocobos have been raised with an emphasis on this attribute.${prompt}
  13398: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  13399: “Endurance” is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.${prompt}
  13400: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  13401: “Discernment” is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.${prompt}
  13402: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  13403: “Receptivity” is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.${prompt}
  13404: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  13405: “Energy” is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.${prompt}
  13406: You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!${prompt}
  13407: “Affection” is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!${prompt}
  13408: You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.${prompt}
  13409: 'If you really want to raise your chocobo''s affection quickly, you can give it ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, but I can''t recommend doing so unless absolutely necessary.${prompt}'
  13410: “Satisfaction” is a term used to describe how full or hungry your chocobo is. If your chocobo is full, it will gain a lot of energy before the next day.${prompt}
  13411: However, when the chocobo is very hungry, its energy will hardly recover at all and its affection will rapidly decrease.${prompt}

    Nothing.${prompt}
  13413: A care schedule is a series of plans that you set up for your chocobo so that we can take care of it while you are away.${prompt}
  13414: How you want us to care for your chocobo each day is completely up to you.${prompt}
  13415: You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).${prompt}
  13416: When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.${prompt}
  13417: With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.${prompt}
  13418: The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.${prompt}
  13419: You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.${prompt}
  13420: The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.${prompt}
  13421: However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.${prompt}
  13422: We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.${prompt}
  13423: Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.${prompt}
  13424: Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.${prompt}
  13425: If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  13426: Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.${prompt}
  13427: If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  13428: Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.${prompt}
  13429: However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.${prompt}
  13430: If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  13431: Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.${prompt}
  13432: But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.${prompt}
  13433: If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  13434: You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  13435: The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.${prompt}
  13436: You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.${prompt}
  13437: The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.${prompt}
  13438: You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  13439: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  13440: You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.${prompt}
  13441: The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.${prompt}
  13442: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  13443: You can choose to have your chocobo act as an extra in a play to improve its receptivity.${prompt}
  13444: You will receive payment in accordance with the chocobo's performance. However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}

    Nothing.${prompt}
  13446: In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  13447: Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.${prompt}
  13448: On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.${prompt}
  13449: However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.${prompt}
  13450: You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  13451: Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.${prompt}
  13452: You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.${prompt}
  13453: I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)${prompt}
  13454: Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.${prompt}
  13455: This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.${prompt}
  13456: Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.${prompt}
  13457: You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.${prompt}
  13458: I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.${prompt}
  13459: Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!${prompt}

    Vegetables.
    Wildgrasses.
    Carrots.
    Worms.
    Medicines.
    Pastes.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  13461: Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.${prompt}
  13462: However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.${prompt}
  13463: The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.${prompt}
  13464: At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!${prompt}
  13465: Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.${prompt}
  13466: There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!${prompt}
  13467: 'Just ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.${prompt}'

  13470: These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.${prompt}
  13471: Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.${prompt}
  13472: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, the effects are different.${prompt}'
  13473: 'In addition, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is effective for illness, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for a stomachache. It''s a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.${prompt}'

  13476: Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  13477: Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!${prompt}
  13478: 'For example, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will dramatically increase your chocobo''s affection, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will restore its energy.${prompt}'
  13479: But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...${prompt}
  13480: 'The most curious of all the worms is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...${prompt}'
  13481: Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  13482: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will restore your chocobo''s energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.${prompt}'
  13483: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.${prompt}'
  13484: A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.${prompt}
  13485: Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.${prompt}
  13486: You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.${prompt}

    Abilities.
    Temperament.
    Weather preferences.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  13489: Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.${prompt}
  13490: For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.${prompt}
  13491: Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.${prompt}
  13492: But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.${prompt}
  13493: The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.${prompt}
  13494: Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.${prompt}
  13495: Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.${prompt}
  13496: Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.${prompt}
  13497: You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.${prompt}
  13498: After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.${prompt}
  13499: 'When your chocobo retires, you will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Be sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  13500: 'You can use the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  13501: The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!${prompt}
  13502: When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.${prompt}
  13503: 'You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}'
  13504: 'You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  13505: I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.${prompt}
  13506: 'When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  13507: You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  13508: That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.${prompt}

    Return.${prompt}
  14643: |-
    Why not!?
    Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.${prompt}
  14644: We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A “win-win situation,” as we like to call it in the business.${prompt}
  14645: However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...${prompt}
  14646: The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.${prompt}
  14647: And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.${prompt}
  14648: Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!${prompt}
  14649: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  14650: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  14651: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  14652: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  14653: Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.${prompt}
  14654: Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.${prompt}
  14655: In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.${prompt}
  14656: Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.${prompt}
  14657: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  14658: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  14659: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  14660: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  14661: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  14662: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  14663: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  14664: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  14665: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.${prompt}'
  14666: You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)${prompt}
  14667: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  14668: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  14669: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  14670: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  14671: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  14672: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
  14673: 'Ah, it says here that you are a member of the ${choice: 0}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.${prompt}'
  14674: Have you come today to change your affiliation?${prompt}
  14675: 'Remember, you will not be able to use any chocobucks earned in ${choice: 0}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst] here, and you will also lose any Solo Victory Points that you may have. Are you sure you want to go through with this?${prompt}'

    That's about it.${prompt}
  14952: A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.${prompt}
  14953: Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.${prompt}
  14954: In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.${prompt}
  14955: For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.${prompt}
  14956: The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.${prompt}
  14957: What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.${prompt}
  14958: Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  14959: Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.${prompt}
  14960: The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.${prompt}
  14961: The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.${prompt}
  14962: The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.${prompt}
  14963: In such an event, the “less endowed” of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.${prompt}
  14964: Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.${prompt}
  14965: Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the “race grade.”${prompt}
  14966: For example, a “C4 Chocobo Race” would indicate a typical grade 4 race.${prompt}
  14967: We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.${prompt}
  14968: No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.${prompt}
  14969: Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.${prompt}
  14970: As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.${prompt}
  14971: Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  14972: Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.${prompt}
  14973: Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.${prompt}
  14974: The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.${prompt}
  14975: As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.${prompt}
  14976: Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  14977: We have a total of four races that run in succession.${prompt}
  14978: Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.${prompt}
  14979: Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.${prompt}
  14980: Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!${prompt}

    Signing up for another race.
    I'm fine, thanks.${prompt}
  14982: There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.${prompt}
  14983: First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.${prompt}
  14984: Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a “race chocobo,” for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.${prompt}
  14985: Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...${prompt}
  14986: All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.${prompt}
  14987: A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.${prompt}
  14988: Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.${prompt}
  14989: There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.${prompt}
  14990: There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.${prompt}
  14991: 'Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.${prompt}'
  14992: 'In the event that you should lose or misplace your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.${prompt}'
  14993: The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!${prompt}
  14994: You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.${prompt}
  14995: 'To collect, simply hand in the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you received during race signup at any signup center.${prompt}'
  14996: The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.${prompt}
  14997: You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.${prompt}
  14998: After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).${prompt}
  14999: This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.${prompt}
  15000: We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.${prompt}

    What would you like to ask?
    ${selection-lines}
    What is chocobetting?
    How do I bet?
    What are odds?
    When do I bet?
    How do I collect winnings?
    Nothing.${prompt}
  15002: Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.${prompt}
  15003: To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.${prompt}
  15004: Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.${prompt}
  15005: For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.${prompt}
  15006: And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.${prompt}
  15007: Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.${prompt}
  15008: The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!${prompt}
  15009: 'To place a chocobet, you must obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the chocobet center. ${prompt}'
  15010: 'For any single ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.${prompt}'
  15011: We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.${prompt}
  15012: Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.${prompt}
  15013: Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.${prompt}
  15014: It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.${prompt}
  15015: What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.${prompt}
  15016: 'Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.${prompt}'
  15017: The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.${prompt}
  15018: Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.${prompt}
  15019: Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.${prompt}
  15020: Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.${prompt}
  15021: 'Once the race is finished, you can exchange your ${item-singular: 0[2]} at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.${prompt}'
  15022: 'Without ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  15023: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.${prompt}'
  15024: Should one week pass, we will be unable to accept the ticket, so it is always best to cash out as soon as possible.${prompt}

  15087: With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.${prompt}
  15088: As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!${prompt}
  15089: “The Monster Races”!${prompt}
  15090: Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing! ${prompt}
  15091: |-
    Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele.
    What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?${prompt}
  15092: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  15093: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  15094: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  15095: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  15096: Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!${prompt}
  15097: |-
    The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal.
    It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.${prompt}
  15098: |-
    Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern.
    If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.${prompt}
  15099: |-
    Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area.
    Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.${prompt}
  15100: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  15101: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  15102: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  15103: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  15104: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  15105: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  15106: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  15107: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  15108: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo''s performance.${prompt}'
  15109: |-
    You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers.
    Thank you for your understanding.${prompt}
  15110: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  15111: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  15112: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  15113: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  15114: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  15115: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
  15116: Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.${prompt}
  15117: |-
    We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence.
    The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.${prompt}
  15118: |-
    Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits.
    And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.${prompt}
  15119: |-
    As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind.
    It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack.
    Consider yourself warned.${prompt}
  15120: |-
    In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well.
    Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part.
    It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!${prompt}
  15121: |-
    Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed.
    These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.${prompt}

  15200: Sakura says, “Don't be fooled by the innocent smile--this girl will rip your chocobo's gizzard out and eat it for a late breakfast or early lunch!”${prompt}
  15201: Sakura says, “This Galka's unrelenting love for all things chocobo makes him a dangerous opponent on the track.”${prompt}
  15202: Sakura says, “Thousands of hours of chocoresearch have sharpened the mind of this jolly jockey into a pointy stick, ready to poke and prod anyone who dares stand in her way.”${prompt}
  15203: 'Our next chocobo is ${choice: 0}[Shining Lady/Moon Night/Jet Fire], ridden by ${choice: 0}[Chanaille, a.k.a. Dances With Chocobos/the chocowhisperer, Sah Zhaowam/Sakura''s number one fan, Chamu-Pashamu].${prompt}'
  15204: Sakura says, “Ain't no one knows a chocobo's heart like this here lil' lady.”${prompt}
  15205: Sakura says, ”She has a good grasp of our vocabulary, but her pronunciation, especially her gutturals and fricatives, need a little work.”${prompt}
  15206: ピヨ～♪${prompt}
  15207: Sakura says she knows who she'll be rooting for this race...${prompt}
  15208: 'The next contestant is ${choice: 0}[Invincible Ace/Gold Queen/Million Spirit], jockeyed by ${choice: 0}[chocobo reincarnate, Vieuballideme/hyper breeder, Graciela/20-year racing veteran, Mayza-Hapurza].${prompt}'
  15209: She says that simply smelling like a chocobo doesn't make one a chocobo.${prompt}
  15210: She says that breeding chocobos is like stocking a warehouse with 10,000 opo-opos and 10,000 typewriters--you are bound to stumble across a masterpiece sooner or later.${prompt}
  15211: She says that this Tarutaru has been practicing the choquestrian arts since he was only two years old.${prompt}
  15212: And that's our lineup. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a feeling that today's match up will go down in the annals of racing history.${prompt}
  15213: And here's today's lineup. What excitement lies in store for all our faithful chocofans listening on the CRA linkshell channel?${prompt}
  15214: The contestants have arrived at the starting line, and the race will begin shortly.${prompt}
  15215: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to another round of awe-inspiring head-to-head chocobo racing! I am Goccilo, your master of ceremonies.
  15216: And joining us today are the commentating duo which require no introduction, the equally adroit and adorable Sakura...
  15217: '...and her obedient interpreter, everyone''s favorite lover of animals, Markovich!'
  15218: Good day, fol--
  15219: ピヨ！
  15220: 'Sakura would like to take this opportunity to speak out against fowl abuse across Vana''diel. '
  15221: And on that note, here come our eight avian racers now!

    #${number: 7}: ${chocobo-name: 3[2]}
  15223: And there's your lineup, folks! It looks like we're going to have a real doozy on our hands here today!
  15224: Well, let's get right down to it! The race is about to begin!
  15225: I must admit, I was a tad vexed about who our bird might be facing today, but I realize now that my petty presentiments were quite unfounded.${prompt}
  15226: Yeah! What he said! You're lucky we're even letting you share the same track as Best!${prompt}
  15227: |-
    Yeah...
    Good luck, ${name-player}...${prompt}
  15228: Today's match is a head-to-head battle, with the winner taking all! Let's start off by introducing our two competitors.${prompt}
  15229: 'And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, ${choice: 0}[Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].${prompt}'
  15230: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'”${prompt}
  15231: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.”${prompt}
  15232: Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.${prompt}
  15233: They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.${prompt}
  15234: Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], Wahboud!${prompt}
  15235: Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!${prompt}
  15236: As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.${prompt}
  15237: ${name-player}. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.${prompt}
  15238: Good luck, ${name-player}. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!${prompt}
  15239: Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!${prompt}
  15240: 'And next we have ${choice: 0}[Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by ${choice: 0}[VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].${prompt}'
  15241: ピヨッ！${prompt}
  15242: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.”${prompt}
  15243: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.”${prompt}
  15244: Sakura says, “Big things often come in small packages.”${prompt}
  15245: Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--${prompt}
  15246: a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!${prompt}
  15247: This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.${prompt}
  15248: Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!${prompt}
  15249: It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted “piece de resistance”?${prompt}
  15250: We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.${prompt}
  15251: Well, there you have it.${prompt}
  15252: Now let's take a look at today's participants...${prompt}
  15253: |-
    Ladies and gentlemen!
    President of the Bastokan Republic, Hrichter Karst, proudly presents...${prompt}
  15254: '...the most prestigious chocobo race in all of southern Quon--the Gustaberg Derby!${prompt}'
  15255: Joining me today is Metalworks mastermind, Cid.${prompt}
  15256: Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?${prompt}
  15257: Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  15258: Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--${prompt}
  15259: The Rakapopo Cup!${prompt}
  15260: Today's guest is Heavens Tower's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Ku～pipi～!${prompt}
  15261: So～,♪ I've lea～rned that yo～u have entered♪ your ve～ry own pe～rsona～l♪ cho～cobo in the cu～p.♪ Wha～t do yo～u think her♪ cha～nces are of ta～king♪ ho～me the gra～nd pri～ze?♪${prompt}
  15262: Are yo～u making fun of me, si～r!? We～ll, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my～ gutty-wutty when my Starlight sai～ls across the finish line yea～rs before the nearest competitaru!♪${prompt}
  15263: Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.${prompt}
  15264: My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!${prompt}
  15265: '${choice: 0}[Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing all★star/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Ne～ver heard of ${choice: 0}[him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!${prompt}'
  15266: We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one “Kamp Kweh.” We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.${prompt}
  15267: Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...${prompt}
  15268: Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take mo～re than an embiggened brainy-wa～iny to beat Starlight!♪${prompt}
  15269: What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.${prompt}
  15270: Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...${prompt}
  15271: Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fa～n! I won't let Starlight lo～se to some impo～ster!${prompt}
  15272: Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called “reincarnate's” redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!${prompt}
  15273: Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?${prompt}
  15274: Hah! Well, I～ have been riding cho～cobos for twenty-one years!${prompt}
  15275: 'And next is ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by ${choice: 1}[San d''Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d''Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!${prompt}'
  15276: Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.${prompt}
  15277: Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...${prompt}
  15278: Both Starlight a～nd the professor hate to take orders... Maybe tha～t's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!♪${prompt}
  15279: The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.${prompt}
  15280: When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.${prompt}
  15281: When the profe～ssor's not stumbling over his spee～ch impediment-ethy, he's re～searching the intricacies of chocobo beha～vioral patterns.${prompt}
  15282: And they're off!
  15283: Markovich, what did you think of the start?
  15284: Well, I fel--
  15285: ピヨピヨッ！
  15286: Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.
  15287: Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  15288: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  15289: And as they pass the halfway mark...
  15290: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} holds on to the lead!'
  15291: '${number: 0} different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!'
  15292: 'While from behind the pack, #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  15293: 'While from behind, #${number: 2} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  15294: 'All ${number: 0} chocobos battle for the lead!'
  15295: Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!
  15296: And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!
  15297: ピヨピヨ！
  15298: Sakura says, “The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.”
  15299: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  15300: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  15301: 'Incredible! ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed is approaching dangerous limits!'
  15302: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!'
  15303: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  15304: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed has begun to drop off!'
  15305: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has begun to tire!'
  15306: The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  15307: The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  15308: The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!
  15309: The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!
  15310: 'The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  15311: 'Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  15312: 'And yet ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems completely unaffected by the attack!'
  15313: And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  15314: And now they're approaching the final corner!
  15315: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  15316: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  15317: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  15318: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead!'
  15319: The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  15320: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  15321: 'And ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} takes the crown!'
  15322: 'What''s this? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  15323: 'And it''s ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} by a beak!!!'
  15324: Let's take a look at the results...${prompt}
  15325: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})${prompt}'
  15326: There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!${prompt}
  15327: Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.${prompt}
  15328: Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.${prompt}
  15329: Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.${prompt}
  15330: |-
    What an amazing race!
    The other chocobos were no match for ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?${prompt}
  15331: 'What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird''s performance?${prompt}'
  15332: '${choice: 0}[Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!${prompt}'
  15333: The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.${prompt}
  15334: Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!${prompt}
  15335: Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...${prompt}
  15336: Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exa～ctly as I expected!♪${prompt}
  15337: The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no wa～y Starlight could lose! Her horoscope sai～d so!${prompt}
  15338: |-
    And there you have it.
    This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!${prompt}
  15339: And now, let's see the results from the last race.
  15340: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})'
  15341: And that's all she wrote, folks!
  15342: 'The winnings for a ${number: 0}-${number: 1} bet come to ${number: 2} gil per quill!'
  15343: Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?
  15344: She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!
  15345: She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.
  15346: Until next time, race fans...
  15347: Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.${prompt}
  15348: 'Taking the crown for today''s race was none other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  15349: 'To the winning steed''s owner we present the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Rocochookie,” I mean, “Chocorookie”!${prompt}'
  15350: 'And to the ambitious and sporting ${name-player}, we present this undeniably useful ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  15351: Good show, ${name-player}. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.${prompt}
  15352: |-
    Excellent race, ${name-player}!
    You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.${prompt}
  15353: Okay, ma～ybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I sti～ll think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!${prompt}
  15354: Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.${prompt}
  15355: But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.${prompt}

  15371: I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.${prompt}
  15372: |-
    Is that so...?
    Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...${prompt}

    Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone.
    You of all people should know that the show must go on!${prompt}
  15374: Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own “baby” will be taking the field!${prompt}
  15375: Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!${prompt}
  15376: |-
    But of course! I had forgotten all about it!
    Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you!
    Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!${prompt}
  15377: |-
    But that's not where it ends!
    There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?${prompt}
  15378: |-
    A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself.
    Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?${prompt}
  15379: It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.${prompt}
  15380: |-
    Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state!
    But...${prompt}
  15381: But...?${prompt}
  15382: I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.${prompt}
  15383: |-
    I see...
    Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?${prompt}
  15384: |-
    You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo.
    Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?${prompt}
  15385: |-
    But enough talking, I say.
    It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!${prompt}
  15386: |-
    Oh, yes, right...
    Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay!
    It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!${prompt}
  15387: 'In the chocobo corner, we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.${prompt}'
  15388: |-
    Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo?
    I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.${prompt}
  15389: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don''t let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, “a wolf in sheep''s clothing”!${prompt}'
  15390: I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!${prompt}
  15391: I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?${prompt}
  15392: Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that “monsters” like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.${prompt}
  15393: Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!${prompt}
  15394: With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!${prompt}
  15395: |-
    Whoopee!
    Bring them on, I say!${prompt}
  15396: |-
    Erm...yes...
    Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.${prompt}
  15397: Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.${prompt}
  15398: |-
    Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki!
    Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.${prompt}
  15399: |-
    Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo.
    I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.${prompt}
  15400: And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!${prompt}
  15401: |-
    My, oh my...!
    I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--${prompt}
  15402: |-
    A-ahem!
    I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.${prompt}
  15403: |-
    All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies!
    Well done, my pretty! Well done!${prompt}
  15404: |-
    It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders...
    <Sniffle>${prompt}
  15405: |-
    Next in the lineup is Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    ...!? What on Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  15406: |-
    Hrmmm...
    Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.${prompt}
  15407: Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...${prompt}
  15408: |-
    What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man!
    There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!${prompt}
  15409: Um, yes... Please forgive me...${prompt}
  15410: |-
    And won't you look at the lineup!
    This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks?
    I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?${prompt}
  15411: And with me today is our regular guest commentator...${prompt}
  15412: |-
    Huh?
    Why isn't Markovich here?${prompt}
  15413: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.${prompt}
  15414: |-
    <Gulp>
    You...you're that mage from Windurst...${prompt}
  15415: '...Professor Shantotto!${prompt}'
  15416: |-
    If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich,
    as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.${prompt}
  15417: |-
    Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence,
    four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.${prompt}
  15418: |-
    So if you care to hear out my little proposal,
    these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.${prompt}
  15419: |-
    With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice...
    Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?${prompt}
  15420: |-
    With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused?
    Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.${prompt}
  15421: First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.${prompt}
  15422: |-
    Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold.
    I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.${prompt}
  15423: Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.${prompt}
  15424: |-
    Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word “failure.”
    Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.${prompt}
  15425: Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.${prompt}
  15426: |-
    Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable.
    If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.${prompt}
  15427: Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!${prompt}
  15428: |-
    For Ace of Trophies, “championship contender” is an unfitting description.
    Even “consecutive champion” would not be too high an expectation.${prompt}
  15429: |-
    Um...Professor Shantotto...
    Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?${prompt}
  15430: |-
    Ohohohohoho!
    Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so.
    But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!${prompt}
  15431: |-
    Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage.
    Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.${prompt}
  15432: |-
    Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview.
    So let the race begin, without further ado!${prompt}
  15433: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    Of this inevitable result, I was always assured--
    that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!${prompt}
  15434: |-
    The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor.
    But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.${prompt}
  15435: |-
    H-hey!
    What do you think you're trying to pull here!?${prompt}
  15436: |-
    My, my, what a pleasant surprise!
    I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.${prompt}
  15437: |-
    How dare you “ohoho” your way into my hard-earned commentary seat!
    This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!${prompt}
  15438: |-
    Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification.
    I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.${prompt}
  15439: |-
    And you, Goccilo!
    What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!${prompt}
  15440: |-
    Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing!
    Until next time...!${prompt}
  15441: ${name-player}, I knew you'd make it all the way here.${prompt}
  15442: |-
    What's with the baffled expression?
    It's me, Sakura.${prompt}
  15443: |-
    You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird.
    I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.${prompt}
  15444: I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.${prompt}
  15445: I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...${prompt}
  15446: And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.${prompt}
  15447: I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.${prompt}
  15448: Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.${prompt}
  15449: I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  15450: I hope that'll be your chocobo, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  15451: |-
    And next, we have Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    But something seems to be different...
    Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.${prompt}
  15452: She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!${prompt}
  15453: The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.${prompt}
  15454: |-
    I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround!
    A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.${prompt}
  15455: And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.${prompt}
  15456: It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.${prompt}
  15457: |-
    And that completes the lineup, folks.
    With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!${prompt}
  15458: 'You find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  15459: Welcome to the Dream Race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  15460: I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.${prompt}
  15461: I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.${prompt}
  15462: I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.${prompt}
  15463: |-
    But no more...
    If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.${prompt}
  15464: This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.${prompt}
  15465: I won't hold back in today's race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  15466: Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.${prompt}
  15467: Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  15468: I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?${prompt}
  15469: Next, we have Sakura...${prompt}
  15470: |-
    Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?
    This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!${prompt}
  15471: |-
    Well I'll be...
    In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!${prompt}
  15472: '...${prompt}'
  15473: |-
    Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks.
    For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?${prompt}
  15474: '${name-player}, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Chocochampion”!${prompt}'
  15475: |-
    Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far!
    Congratulations!${prompt}
  15476: |-
    Great race, ${name-player}.
    It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.${prompt}
  15477: |-
    But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come..
    With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...${prompt}
  15478: |-
    Princess...
    Princess Sakura!${prompt}
  15479: |-
    Princess...?
    What are you talking about? Who are you?${prompt}
  15480: |-
    Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion.
    I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.${prompt}
  15481: Searching for...me?${prompt}
  15482: |-
    Yes, Your Highness.
    You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.${prompt}
  15483: |-
    Are you serious!?
    Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?${prompt}
  15484: |-
    That is correct.
    Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.${prompt}
  15485: D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?${prompt}
  15486: |-
    ...!
    I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...${prompt}
  15487: Wh...what happened?${prompt}
  15488: |-
    You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world.
    You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...${prompt}
  15489: She...she gave up her life to save me?${prompt}
  15490: |-
    Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again.
    But, I never once gave up hope...${prompt}
  15491: My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.${prompt}
  15492: So that's what happened...${prompt}
  15493: Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos! ${prompt}
  15494: '...${prompt}'
  15495: I'm sorry, but I can't go.${prompt}
  15496: |-
    Your Highness!
    But...why!?${prompt}
  15497: Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like ${name-player}'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.${prompt}
  15498: What's more...${prompt}
  15499: I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...${prompt}
  15500: I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.${prompt}
  15501: What...?${prompt}
  15502: The only place I belong is here, beside you.${prompt}
  15503: |-
    And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer?
    I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?${prompt}
  15504: I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!${prompt}
  15505: |-
    Heehee!
    Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!${prompt}
  15506: |-
    ${name-player}, I'm looking forward to our rematch!
    Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?${prompt}
  15507: You're still here, eh, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  15508: Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?${prompt}
  15509: |-
    What?
    How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?${prompt}
  15510: |-
    Hohoho...
    It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.${prompt}
  15511: I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...${prompt}
  15512: |-
    Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos?
    No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.${prompt}
  15513: Sakura is the queen, you say?${prompt}
  15514: |-
    <Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises.
    But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.${prompt}
  15515: |-
    You know what they say: Home is where the heart is.
    To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.${prompt}
  15516: |-
    And you, our new Chocochampion!
    Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.${prompt}
  15517: |-
    Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today.
    These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.${prompt}
  15518: And they're off!
  15519: |-
    Hrmmm!
    ${choice: 0}[Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!
  15520: Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?
  15521: |-
    All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance.
    But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.
  15522: Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  15523: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  15524: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  15525: The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  15526: The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!
  15527: And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  15528: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  15529: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead!'
  15530: The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  15531: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has used ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!'
  15532: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  15533: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  15534: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  15535: 'What''s this? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  15536: '${number: 1}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}${prompt}'
  15537: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s using ${choice: 1}[Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!'
  15538: 'Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those ${choice: 0}[monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!'
  15539: |-
    ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed!
    And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!
  15540: "I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s step. \nAnd the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!"
  15541: |-
    And here's some unexpected drama, folks!
    The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?
  15542: 'Look at that! ${lettercase: 1}${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!'
  15543: |-
    Uh-oh, what's going on here!?
    The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!
  15544: 'Oooh! In a bold move, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has just used a ${choice: 0}[Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!'
  15545: |-
    What's this!?
    All of the chocobos other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!
  15546: |-
    Thanks to that brazen little act, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks!
    That just might seal the deal for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!
  15547: |-
    Never in all my days, race fans!
    In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!
  15548: |-
    How could my creation make such a rookie mistake?
    In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!
  15549: Shantotto starts casting Tornado!
  15550: The speed of the chocobos has dropped!
  15551: The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!
  15552: The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!
  15553: |-
    Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!?
    What in the world do you think you're doing!?
  15554: |-
    Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame.
    This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.
  15555: |-
    What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today?
    I've heard it being said that today's ${choice: 0}[creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal.
    This could get heavy, folks!
  15556: |-
    All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them.
    Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?
  15557: It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!
  15558: |-
    There's still plenty of race to go, race fans!
    More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!
  15559: And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!
  15560: |-
    The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now.
    This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!
  15561: |-
    This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent.
    Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!
  15562: |-
    And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty!
    Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!
  15563: |-
    And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them!
    But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?
  15564: |-
    I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call!
    Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?
  15565: |-
    It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now!
    The time for a final spurt is now or never!
  15566: And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?
  15567: 'Why are you talking to me? You should be out there aiding ${choice: 1}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst]''s fight to prove you are better than those ${choice: 0}[San d''Orians/Bastokers/Windurstians], kupo!${prompt}'

  15768: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt}
  15769: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  15770: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt}
  15771: |-
    Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.
    If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt}
  15772: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  15773: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  15774: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  15775: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  15776: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  15777: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  15778: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  15779: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  15780: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  15781: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  15782: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  15783: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  15784: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  15785: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  15786: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  15787: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  15788: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  15789: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  15790: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  15791: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  15792: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  15793: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  15794: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  15795: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  15796: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  15797: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  15798: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  15799: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  15800: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  15801: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  15802: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  15803: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  15804: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  15805: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  15806: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  15807: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  15808: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  15809: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  15810: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  15811: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  15812: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  15813: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  15814: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  15815: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  15816: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  15817: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  15818: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  15819: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  15820: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  15821: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  15822: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  15823: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  15824: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  15825: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  15826: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  15827: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  15828: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  15829: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  15830: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  15831: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  15832: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  15833: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  15834: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  15835: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  15836: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  15837: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  15838: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  15839: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  15840: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  15841: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  15842: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  15843: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  15844: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  15845: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  15846: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  15847: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  15848: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  15849: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  15850: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  15851: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?
    Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt}

    Oh, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too!
    What skills does it require? Let's see here...${prompt}
  15867: |-
    Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one!
    Ain't synergy grand?${prompt}
  15868: |-
    Wait! No, don't tell me.
    You strike me as a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.${prompt}
  15869: |-
    Learn about synergy?
    ${selection-lines}
    Not today.
    Teach me!
    Just give me ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  15870: |-
    A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living.
    Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.${prompt}
  15871: |-
    I thought you'd never ask!
    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  15872: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  15873: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'
  15874: |-
    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  15875: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  15876: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  15877: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  15878: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  15879: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  15880: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}
  15881: |-
    That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.
    Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt}
  15882: |-
    An aspiring synergist, I see!
    If you're looking for ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you've certainly come to the right place.${prompt}
  15883: |-
    I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for ${number: 0} gil.
    A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?${prompt}
  15884: '${number: 0} gil, paid in full!${prompt}'
  15885: |-
    As promised, here's your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you!
    How's that for a deal?${prompt}
  15886: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  15887: Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.${prompt}

  15892: 'To make use of my services, first you''ll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of ${number: 19} gil.${prompt}'
  15893: Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt}
  15894: You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt}
  15895: Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt}
  15896: |-
    Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.
    I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt}
  15897: |-
    Invisible to you, at least.
    It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt}
  15898: When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt}
  15899: |-
    I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.
    Simple as that, kupo!${prompt}
  15900: |-
    What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!
    Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt}
  15901: |-
    Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.
    So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt}
  15902: For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt}
  15903: |-
    Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!
    It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt}
  15904: Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt}
  15905: |-
    If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!
    No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”
    Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt}
  15906: Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt}
  15907: If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt}
  15908: |-
    And that's all there is to it.

    I've been working with these here martellos since I was knee-high.

    Ask something?
    ${selection-lines}
    So, what's a martello?
    Martello replenishment.
    Martello upgrades.
    Cautionary notes.
    Not now.${prompt}
  16002: |-
    The device we know as the martello was first developed by military engineers many years past, during an age of great war.
    Martellos serve to keep combatants fighting fit, healing their wounds and restoring their mental energies.${prompt}
  16003: You will observe that martellos have been constructed in numerous locales, so as to provide strategically located safe havens for harried resistance fighters. No doubt you will find yourself making use of them as well.${prompt}
  16004: In the bowels of each martello is contained a tank designed to hold martello fuel.${prompt}
  16005: |-
    This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is the lifeblood of the martello, and the source of its curative powers.
    Depleted stores will render the device little more than an oversized parchmentweight.${prompt}
  16006: That being the case, we're in continual need of volunteers willing to take on the vital task of replenishing these martellos.${prompt}
  16007: |-
    I have been charged with overseeing a supply of martello fuel.
    Should you be willing to take part in a replenishment run, you need only say the word.
    Needless to say, you will not go unrewarded for your efforts.${prompt}
  16008: |-
    Feast your eyes on this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. She's a beauty, isn't she?
    Installing one of these into a martello will increase its fuel capacity.${prompt}
  16009: |-
    An upgraded martello will be able to sustain its energy stores for a longer time between replenishment operations.
    Needless to say, this is a blessing and a half to those on the battlefield.${prompt}
  16010: |-
    Unfortunately, the installation procedure is quite complex.

  16385: Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.${prompt}
  16386: Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.${prompt}
  16387: “Unity” is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.${prompt}
  16388: Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.${prompt}
  16389: 'Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as “${keyitem-plural: 1[2]}.”${prompt}'
  16390: Chat settings may be changed by selecting “Status” from the main menu, and choosing “Unity Info” under the “Unity” submenu.${prompt}
  16391: You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.${prompt}
  16392: Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.${prompt}
  16393: The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.${prompt}
  16394: Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).${prompt}
  16395: Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.${prompt}
  16396: “Wanted” objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.${prompt}
  16397: These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as “Unity accolades” to undertake.${prompt}
  16398: Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.${prompt}
  16399: Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.${prompt}
  16400: The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.${prompt}
  16401: A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.${prompt}
  16402: Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.${prompt}
  16403: Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.${prompt}
  16404: When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.${prompt}
  16405: Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  16406: No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.${prompt}
  16407: You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.${prompt}
  16408: An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.${prompt}
  16409: One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.${prompt}
  16410: A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.${prompt}
  16411: You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.${prompt}
  16412: Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.${prompt}
  16413: Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.${prompt}
  16414: Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.${prompt}
  16415: The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.${prompt}
  16416: It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.${prompt}
  16417: The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.${prompt}
  16418: Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  16419: These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.${prompt}
  16420: Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.${prompt}
  16421: 'Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of ${number: 0} accolades per week (Earth time).${prompt}'
  16422: You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.${prompt}
  16423: This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.${prompt}
  16424: This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.${prompt}
  16425: However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.${prompt}
  16426: Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.${prompt}
  16427: The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.${prompt}
  16428: Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.${prompt}
  16429: Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.${prompt}
  16430: On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.${prompt}
  16431: 'Additionally, an individual''s evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by ${number: 0}. A Unity''s ranking is the average of all eligible members'' individual evaluations.${prompt}'
  16432: The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.${prompt}
  16433: Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.${prompt}
  16434: 'Those with evaluations of ${number: 0} or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.${prompt}'
  16435: Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.${prompt}
  16436: A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.${prompt}
  16437: Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.${prompt}
  16438: A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.${prompt}
  16439: It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.${prompt}
  16440: Those desiring to participate should seek out one of the initiative's representatives, dressed in green, in one of the three nations.${prompt}
