  7637: Such enthusiasm!${prompt}

  7639: |-
    Such enthusiasm!
    We certainly welcome beginners.${prompt}
  7640: Ah, how positively rude of me.${prompt}
  7641: |-
    You may address me as Professor Erlene.
    As well as serving on the Operations Staff here in the necropolis, I teach martial theory to academic applicants in my capacity as a military scholar.${prompt}
  7642: |-
    And what is martial theory, you ask?
    In a nutshell, it is the study of applying tactics and strategy to ensure victory on the field of battle.${prompt}
  7643: The Schultz School of Martial Theory mainly focuses on the study of ancient military magic texts known as “grimoires.”${prompt}
  7644: The beauty of this approach is the effective incorporation of spells and incantations into the latest strategies and tactics.${prompt}
  7645: Pupils schooled in Schultz martial theory are valued across Vana'diel as military tacticians.${prompt}
  7646: Allow me to demonstrate the dual nature of the grimoire.${prompt}
  7647: That was the white grimoire.${prompt}
  7648: And this, the black grimoire.${prompt}
  7649: Do I have your full attention now?${prompt}
  7650: Utilizing the teachings of the Schultz theories, one is able to switch between the two as the situation demands.${prompt}
  7651: What is all the commotion?
  7652: Professor Ulbrecht, when did you return?${prompt}
  7653: Must I introduce myself to our guest, Professor Erlene?${prompt}
  7654: Greetings, I am Professor Ulbrecht, chief of operations of the Republican Army of Bastok.${prompt}
  7655: |-
    Hehehe.
    From my observations, I would say your interest was captured more by that flashy grimoire display than Professor Erlene's explanation of Schultz martial theory!${prompt}
  7656: |-
    Ah, I do not mean to criticize.
    It is natural for us to feel wonder at the things we do not understand.
    That curiosity is your ally.${prompt}
  7657: |-
    However, mastery of the grimoire requires more than simple enthusiasm.
    A pity, but I do not think you--${prompt}
  7658: Oh, enough of your ponderous blustering, Professor.${prompt}
  7659: |-
    “The gates of knowledge must not be closed to one with a willingness to learn.”
    Is this not a fundamental law of the Schultz school?${prompt}
  7660: Do not take the professor's flippant dismissal to heart--you will have your chance to learn.${prompt}
  7661: |-
    There are, however, certain requirements.
    You must understand, the grimoires are valuable tomes...${prompt}
  7662: |-
    Ah, I am not seeking to deprive you of coin.
    There are other--${prompt}
  7663: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}!

  7664: |-
    Professor Ulbrecht!
    I'll thank you not to interrupt me.${prompt}
  7665: |-
    Have I misspoken?
    Do we not require this material in abundance?${prompt}
  7666: 'While the matter is not terribly urgent, I believe twelve ${item-plural: 0[2]} should cover our needs.${prompt}'
  7667: You have your task. Altana's fortune smile upon you!${prompt}

  7669: 'Twelve! Not one less!${wait-35: 2}${prompt}'
  7670: Professor...!${prompt}
  7671: |-
    <Sigh>...
    If you would be so kind as to collect twelve ${item-plural: 0[2]}, I shall begin planning an exclusive curriculum for your introduction to martial theory.${prompt}
  7672: |-
    Your first task is to collect twelve ${item-plural: 0[2]}.
    Once you have the requisite materials, please deliver them here to me.${prompt}
  7673: |-
    Ah, the ${item-plural: 0[2]}.
    Excellent.${prompt}
  7674: While I am still rather irked at Professor Ulbrecht's imposition, it is true we scholars can never have enough vellum in stock.${prompt}
  7675: I have already prepared your grimoire from our available supplies, of course.${prompt}
  7676: Inside, I have inscribed a curriculum on which to base your studies.${prompt}
  7677: |-
    Your grimoire is both magical tome and tactical manual.
    A military scholar fights with both intellect and knowledge--this book will be your weapon.${prompt}
  7678: |-
    Tell me, what are the two main schools of magic?${wait-36: 1}
    Yes, white magic and black magic. Their natures are diametrically opposed, leading most practitioners to focus on one school or the other in order to attain true mastery.${prompt}
  7679: However, we scholars learn the laws of magic as a single theory, and thus overcome the disadvantages inherent in specialization.${prompt}
  7680: In simple terms, we are able to utilize the full potential of both forms of magic.${prompt}
  7681: |-
    From a tactical point of view, a scholar can choose the incantation most suitable for the task at hand, regardless of school.
    That is the strength that lies at the heart of the Schultz School of Martial Theory.${prompt}
  7682: |-
    But rather than listen to me drone, you would be better served by reading the grimoire and experiencing the theory for yourself.
    One learns faster through “doing,” yes?${prompt}
  7683: |-
    Very well.
    Let's have you read the first page while producing an “arcane tap” effect.${prompt}
  7684: This manifestation of arcane energy will trigger the astral properties of the grimoire, and empower the words within.${prompt}
  7685: It will also serve to attune the tome to your personal astral signature.${prompt}
  7686: Ah...${prompt}
  7687: |-
    An arcane tap effect is somewhat different to the sudden burst of magic provided by spells such as “Fire.”
    It is a steady stream of magical energy.${prompt}
  7688: |-
    Both “Manafont” and “Chainspell” are examples of arcane tap effects.
    How else can I explain...?${prompt}
  7689: |-
    Ah, yes.
    While similar, “Benediction” will not produce the required energy.
    The magical power of such abilities dissipate at the culmination of spellcasting.${prompt}
  7690: Do you understand the difference?${prompt}
  7691: Now, initiate whichever arcane tap effect is available to you, and open the grimoire to the first page in order to complete the attunement process.${prompt}
  7692: Hmm, if I'm not mistaken, it appears you are not currently capable of tapping into a steady source of arcane energy...${prompt}
  7693: |-
    How vexing.
    You must have the ability to produce an arcane tap effect, or we cannot proceed with the attunement.${prompt}
  7694: It must be a source of magic originating from the applicant...${prompt}
  7695: I'm sorry, this is a stumbling block that you alone must overcome.${prompt}
  7696: Congratulations on entering the Schultz School of Martial Theory!${prompt}
  7697: Professor Ulbrecht...${prompt}
  7698: |-
    No need to steam up your glasses, Professor Erlene.
    I'm merely here to pick up the ${item-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  7699: |-
    Ah, here we are!
    Splendid.${prompt}
  7700: Were you aware that the history of magic stretches back six hundred years?${prompt}
  7701: During that time, the rapid evolution of magical research has produced a myriad of spells and incantations.${prompt}
  7702: |-
    However!
    The effective utilization of these spells has never been the subject of thorough academic inquiry!${prompt}
  7703: These so-called “mages” have been so infatuated with their own power, that they have never spent the time to meditate on the method of its use.${prompt}
  7704: In this respect, their ignorance equals that of common military scholars, who, on the other hand, have ignored the existence of magic in their strategies.${prompt}
  7705: And that is where the Schultz School of Martial Theory breaks away from the pack!${prompt}
  7706: In this age of stunning magical revolution, we are the only school to fuse arcane mystery with modern military tactics!${prompt}
  7707: |-
    A stirring oration indeed.
    But, “a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.”${prompt}
  7708: Eh...?${prompt}
  7709: Do you recall that lesson, Ulbrecht?${prompt}
  7710: Professor Schultz!${prompt}
  7711: The roads are not safe! How did you...!?${prompt}
  7712: A pleasure to see you again, Erlene. Ulbrecht.${prompt}
  7713: |-
    “The resourceful general employs his enemies as well as his allies.”
    I merely hopped in the back of a passing beastman supply wagon, and alighted near my destination.${prompt}
  7714: Same old Professor Schultz...${prompt}
  7715: I believe introductions are in order.${prompt}
  7716: Erlene, if you might do me the honor?${prompt}
  7717: (This is Professor Gunther Schultz, the founder of the Schultz School of Martial Theory!)${prompt}
  7718: (He is a hero of Bastok, the type of genius that is born once a century...)${prompt}
  7719: Erlene.${prompt}
  7720: |-
    My name and title would have been sufficient.
    I am but a member of academic society, nothing more.${prompt}
  7721: |-
    And who do we have here?${wait-36: 2}
    ${name-player}, is it?${prompt}
  7722: In this world of chaos, there is always an avenue to salvation.${prompt}
  7723: In one age, that salvation may take the form of a brilliant, charismatic leader; in another age, an immensely powerful weapon.${prompt}
  7724: However, I believe the key to ending this war will be the knowledge and actions of those who have mastered the arts of the military scholar.${prompt}
  7725: |-
    That is my firm conviction.
    And I am certain a day will come when you will hold the same belief.${prompt}
  7726: |-
    Oh, but listen to me ramble.
    I have no time to be delivering lectures...${prompt}
  7727: |-
    The Schultz School of Martial Theory encourages practical application.
    Only through testing your strategies in the heat of battle will you begin to grow as a scholar.${prompt}
  7728: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Do not lose yourself in the power of the grimoire, but look within yourself for the direction you must tread.${prompt}
  7729: 'Now, if you will excuse me.${wait-35: 2}${prompt}'
  7730: You can now become a scholar!${prompt}
  7731: |-
    Phew, my heart is racing.
    One never knows when Professor Schultz will make an appearance...${prompt}
  7732: |-
    You are extremely fortunate to have been blessed with his guidance so early in your career.
    Lock those words in your mind, ${name-player}, and never let them go.${prompt}
  7733: '${number: 0}${prompt}'
  7734: |-
    Well, if it isn't ${name-player}.
    How does today find you? In good spirits, I hope. And how are you finding the grimoire?${prompt}
  7735: |-
    It would seem that you are coming along quite splendidly in your studies.
    I would expect no less from a student of the Schultz School of Martial Theory.${prompt}
  7736: I truly wish Professor Schultz were here to witness your development firsthand...${prompt}
  7737: What's that? Oh, it's nothing serious, I'm sure.${prompt}
  7738: It's just that I haven't been able to establish contact with the professor recently.${prompt}
  7739: |-
    I know that he had become quite concerned with the goings-on of the beastmen.
    Were I to wager a guess, I would say that he has crossed enemy lines in an effort to observe them.${prompt}
  7740: Given that he was absent from the last convening of military strategists, I must admit, I've come to worry.${prompt}
  7741: |-
    ${name-player}, might I impose a request upon you?
    I'm afraid that my duties bind me here. Would you be willing to seek out the professor in my place?${prompt}
  7742: I just need to know that he is alright...${prompt}
  7743: |-
    Well, look who's back. ${name-player}, wasn't it? Yes, yes, of course.
    Pardon my barging in, but I thought I overheard Professor Schultz's name being mentioned.${prompt}
  7744: |-
    Oh? So you're off to locate the good professor, are you?
    What a remarkable coincidence! Please, should you happen to find him, pass this along with my regards, will you?${prompt}
  7745: |-
    Let it never be said that your timing is not most impeccable, ${name-player}.
    You are already beginning to prove your worth.${prompt}
  7746: |-
    <Sigh>...
    Ulbrecht's behavior is most infuriating.${prompt}
  7747: |-
    He seems not at all worried about the professor's well-being.
    And on top of that, he feels it an appropriate time to be requesting deliveries, of all things!${prompt}
  7748: |-
    I apologize. I do not wish to compound your troubles.
    Alas, I also have no recourse but to request your services as well.${prompt}
  7749: |-
    I implore you. Please find Professor Schultz and make sure he is alright.
    This is our most desperate hour. Help me, ${name-player}. You're my only hope.${prompt}
  7750: |-
    This isn't the first time this has happened.
    The professor went missing before, some time ago.${prompt}
  7751: |-
    At that time it was a pupil of his named Nicolaus who was eventually able to locate him.
    Come to mention it, perhaps he would be able to provide you with some helpful information.${prompt}
  7752: |-
    After that he enjoyed several promotions, and is now an eminent member of Bastok's Mythril Musketeers.
    So you should be able to find him in the Metalworks.${prompt}
  7753: |-
    I truly regret having to ask you to do this, but there is no other way.
    Please--Professor Schultz must be found.${prompt}
  7754: |-
    Please, Professor Schultz must be found.${wait-36: 1}
    Oh, and don't forget to pass along ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}
  7755: |-
    That is most delightful to hear!
    Quite a burden has been lifted from me, knowing that the professor is safe.
    You have done me a great service, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7756: |-
    So you were able to find the old curmudgeon, were you?
    And how was he? Fine and dandy, I presume?${prompt}
  7757: |-
    I fear I'll never quite understand that man.
    I bet he even greeted you as though nothing at all was awry. Am I right?${prompt}
  7758: |-
    By the way, it happens that the sealed letter I entrusted to you contained my reflections on the development of the Allied Forces in the near future.
    I wonder, did he have any comments on the matter?${prompt}
  7759: |-
    What's this? He even went so far as to commit a response to paper? Just for me?
    But this is...${prompt}
  7760: |-
    No matter. I will see to the professor's safety.
    Many thanks for your trouble... ${name-player}, was it? Yes, of course.
    Well, here I shall take my leave of you. Until we next meet.${prompt}
  7761: |-
    Professor Ulbrecht, with all due respect, ${name-player} has faithfully carried out the task which you requested of ${choice: 0}[her/him].
    Surely that warrants something more than a few mere words of thanks.${prompt}
  7762: 'As senior to this pupil, would it not be appropriate for you to present ${choice: 0}[her/him] with a reward befitting the service rendered?${prompt}'
  7763: |-
    In fact, you showed the same indignation and presumptuousness when you first asked ${choice: 0}[her/him] to deliver the ${item-plural: 1[2]}.
    Does it never occur to you to act with some modicum of tact!?${prompt}
  7764: |-
    Hmph. I suppose you may be right.${wait-36: 2}
    Forgive my imprudence, Professor.${prompt}
  7765: |-
    How about this, then?
    An old classic for any aspiring scholar. A ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  7766: |-
    I've been through this edition so many times that I can recite it from memory.
    It may be just the thing for you, though. Here, it is yours now.${prompt}
  7767: The basics of our field are the same now as they have been for ages. Little in war is apt to change.${prompt}
  7768: |-
    By no means do I intend to downplay the necessity and value of staying up to date on the latest developments in weaponry and tactics.
    But in your studies you will find that it is often the timeless classics which embody the true essence of military strategy.${prompt}
  7769: Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.${prompt}
  7770: Ahem...${prompt}
  7771: 'Hey! You''re just repeating what Professor Schultz said! ${wait-35: 2}${prompt}'
  7772: |-
    I'm elated to hear that the professor is alright.
    I owe you a debt of gratitude.${prompt}
  7773: |-
    Thank you again for your help.
    If you're still worried about Professor Schultz, you'll be happy to hear that he is safe now.${prompt}
  7774: |-
    Ulbrecht orchestrated a marvel of military extraction and was able to rescue him.
    It is only under such extreme circumstances that his true affection for the professor becomes evident.${prompt}
  7775: |-
    You've come quite a long way, ${name-player}.
    The grimoire you hold there alone is evidence of that.${prompt}
  7776: |-
    ... ${wait-36: 2}
    Actually, I have yet another favor to ask of you.${prompt}
  7777: "I fear that it may be a somewhat dangerous task, so I will understand if you refuse. \nBut our fellow pupils are in dire need of assistance. Will you at least listen?${prompt}"
  7778: |-
    Will you hear her out?
    ${selection-lines}
    Certainly. Go on.
    Now is not the time.${prompt}
  7779: |-
    I apologize. It was rude of me to presume...
    It's just that... No, I'm sorry. I will not trouble you with it.${prompt}
  7780: |-
    Thank you! Only...
    It may be unwise to speak here. Come, follow me.${prompt}
  7781: |-
    Perhaps you have heard, but the educated and wise mages of the Allied Forces have been disappearing as of late.
    Were it from the field of battle, perhaps it would not seem so suspicious.
    In many cases, however, it is happening right at our very own bases and encampments.${prompt}
  7782: |-
    They can no longer be thought of as isolated incidents. Nor is it the plight of Bastok alone.
    We have received reports of the same nature from both San d'Oria and Windurst.${prompt}
  7783: |-
    At first we assumed that they were merely deserters, fleeing in these times of crisis.
    Yet the numbers are far too great to maintain that theory.
    And many of those gone missing would have no reason to do so under normal circumstances.${prompt}
  7784: |-
    Of course, investigation by the three nations is ongoing.
    But the Allied Forces were formed such a short time ago, and are still in their nascent stages.${prompt}
  7785: At this point we lack the rudimentary organization even to allow for effective exchange of information.${prompt}
  7786: |-
    That is why we scholars were selected by the alliance to share in the burdens of communication.
    The multinational scholastic network we already have in place far surpasses that of the armies.${prompt}
  7787: Officer Adelheid has appointed me to head up the investigations here in Bastok.${prompt}
  7788: |-
    Other such officials have been designated abroad, as well.
    In San d'Oria, the Royal Army has appointed Machudiaux.${prompt}
  7789: |-
    In Windurst, it is Fhen Lakrifhel.
    In Derfland, Lena. For Aragoneu, Nalkuku.${prompt}
  7790: And on the Norvallen Front, it is Ulbrecht who is in charge, with whom you are already acquainted.${prompt}
  7791: |-
    I realize he may seem...ill-suited to the task.
    But it is under circumstances precisely such as these that he shows just how dependable he truly is.${prompt}
  7792: Our charge consists of taking the intel obtained by the armies, and carefully analyzing it locally.${prompt}
  7793: I would like to ask you, ${name-player}, to assist our colleagues in this task.${prompt}
  7794: |-
    There is currently a council being planned for all of the leaders in the near future.
    We will convene in order to share our collected information, and hopefully bring about a swift end to this ongoing tragedy.${prompt}
  7795: |-
    The council will be held in San d'Oria.
    Unfortunately, I have other pressing matters, and will be unable to attend.${prompt}
  7796: I apologize for the abruptness of my request, but would you be willing to participate in the council in my stead?${prompt}
  7797: |-
    I owe you a great debt, ${name-player}. You have my thanks.
    And please let me know if there is anything which you might require.${prompt}
  7798: |-
    ${name-player}? You must tell me, what happened at the council?
    I have heard nothing but worrisome talk.${prompt}
  7799: What!? Fhen has gone missing?${prompt}
  7800: |-
    It had not occurred to me until now, but to think...
    If all those who wield magic are being targeted, then that would mean we scholars are at risk as well.${prompt}
  7801: To best protect ourselves it would be wise to avoid being unaccompanied at all times. Whether at home or abroad.${prompt}
  7802: |-
    Some may be unwilling to accept such a proposal, though.
    Despite their intellect and judgment, many of those among us are exceedingly confident, almost to a fault.
    Ulbrecht not least of all...${prompt}
  7803: |-
    ${name-player}, you have not yet gained wide recognition as a scholar.
    I pray that puts you at less risk than the others.${prompt}
  7804: When you meet with them, please, advise them strongly against traveling or moving about on their own.${prompt}
  7805: And do take care of yourself as well...${prompt}
  7806: Word has reached me that the next appointed meeting ground is Sauromugue Champaign.${prompt}
  7807: |-
    Head south from here, and just as you exit the Rolanberry Fields, cross the Great Jeuno Bridge.
    The champaign lies just beyond.${prompt}
  7808: You must hurry!${prompt}
  7809: |-
    What is it, ${name-player}? Your expression does not bode well...
    Please, tell me what you have learned!${prompt}
  7810: But that cannot be! All of the pupils!?${prompt}
  7811: |-
    And what of Ulbrecht!?
    Surely he has not disappeared as well!${prompt}
  7812: |-
    What will you tell Erlene?
    ${selection-lines}
    I don't know.
    Tell the truth.${prompt}
  7813: This... This is Ulbrecht's hat. But how...?${prompt}
  7814: What has that fool gone and done now...?${prompt}
  7815: I'm sorry. I must not become so distracted.${prompt}
  7816: |-
    You must get to Ghoyu's Reverie. A thorough search of the area will require assistance, however.
    I will contact Officer Adelheid.${prompt}
  7817: Begging your pardon. My apologies for interrupting.${prompt}
  7818: |-
    I am Nag'molada of the Allied Forces. I have been sent by general headquarters.
    An audience has been requested of you, should you have the time.${prompt}
  7819: General headquarters...? But that could only mean...${prompt}
  7820: |-
    Please, take your time making any preparations you must before departure.
    I shall await you outside.${prompt}
  7821: ${name-player}, take these.${prompt}
  7822: |-
    It is your very own pair of ${item-singular: 0[2]}.
    I wish it was under better circumstances that I was presenting them to you...
    I didn't intend for it to happen this way.${prompt}
  7823: |-
    I must go now to see for what reason I am being summoned.
    But do please come back another time.${prompt}
  7824: |-
    And now I shall take my leave of you.
    We will see each other again soon.${prompt}
  7825: |-
    I have a feeling the time will come when I will have to rely on you yet again, ${name-player}.
    Until then, I leave you in the grace and favor of the Goddess.${prompt}
  7826: I am thankful that at least you have remained safe.${prompt}
  7827: |-
    You've come back, ${name-player}.
    It seems that general headquarters has begun to spearhead investigations into the disappearing magi.${prompt}
  7828: |-
    It was just as your evidence indicated.
    The culprit was none other than Ulbrecht himself.${prompt}
  7829: I was called to appear at headquarters, where I was issued a prepared statement...${prompt}
  7830: |-
    “In these times of war-wrought chaos, the wisdom and insight of the scholars are assets whose significance cannot be overlooked.
    That is to say, you are a necessary evil. However...”${prompt}
  7831: “Upon cessation of hostilities, your kind will no longer have a place in the alliance.”${prompt}
  7832: |-
    I had anticipated hearing as much as soon as I was summoned.
    Still, I confess I was a bit shocked...${prompt}
  7833: I'm sorry... I've gone and gotten all verklempt...${prompt}
  7834: |-
    But this is not over yet!
    The errors of the pupils shall be corrected by the pupils!${prompt}
  7835: I believe Professor Schultz may know something about the whereabouts of Ulbrecht.${prompt}
  7836: |-
    Don't you remember, ${name-player}?
    The time that the professor vanished and you located him for me.${prompt}
  7837: You received a sealed letter, which you passed along to Ulbrecht.${prompt}
  7838: It was just shortly after that when the magicians of the Allied Forces began to disappear one after the other.${prompt}
  7839: |-
    The professor must know something.
    And even if he doesn't, if anyone can find something out, it's him.${prompt}
  7840: Unfortunately, as always, the professor is off somewhere doing Goddess knows what...${prompt}
  7841: Do you think you could track down Professor Schultz yet again?${prompt}
  7842: Nicolaus has even provided some advice to aid you, as he has some experience with sniffing out the professor himself.${prompt}
  7843: He has asked me to pass it along.${prompt}
  7844: |-
    “Whenever the professor disappears with a specific aim in mind, he leaves behind clues in his wake, without fail.
    Search for these, and you will find finding him not so daunting a task.”${prompt}
  7845: Perhaps such a hint could be found in the spot where you first located the professor!${prompt}
  7846: |-
    I would suggest trying your luck there first.
    I will attempt to obtain more information from other sources.${prompt}
  7847: Hm? Nicolaus's advice?${prompt}
  7848: A sealed letter?${prompt}
  7849: Hmmm... No addressee and no sender...${prompt}
  7850: |-
    This is sealed with a shrouding magic to protect the identities of the concerned parties. Very hush-hush.
    See how the incantation is pressed directly into the sealing wax?${prompt}
  7851: |-
    But the mere fact that you happened across it makes me think...
    I wonder... ${name-player}, perhaps it is addressed to you!${prompt}
  7852: Show me! Show me!${prompt}
  7853: |-
    This is from the professor. Without a doubt.
    Only he would be so bold as to ink out a letter in mirror-writing...${prompt}
  7854: But what could this mean...?${prompt}
  7855: '“Only when nourished and bathed in deep crimson depths of the most magicked bloods, shall the true tome of stratagems be borne”${prompt} '
  7856: “And that which riseth forth will come to be feared by all, Bloodseed Grimoire.”${prompt}
  7857: |-
    “Yet if left besmirched by the coursing magics of this profane world, all will be in vain.
    Such blood when commanded to script will serve naught but to soak the page, running into incomprehensibility.”${prompt}
  7858: |-
    “Recourse for those who would seek absolution is limited to a single path.
    The purging must take place where banishing stones form, and fountainheads spew forth.”${prompt}
  7859: Bloodseed...Grimoire...?${prompt}
  7860: |-
    I've never even heard the name before.
    In what way could it be different...?${prompt}
  7861: This “magicked bloods” referred to here... I certainly don't like the sound of that.${prompt}
  7862: |-
    It couldn't possibly...
    No, I mustn't allow myself such thoughts.
    But why would the professor have written a letter such as this?${prompt}
  7863: |-
    What could be going through his mind?
    And what exactly is Ulbrecht trying to accomplish?
    My mind is plagued by questions with no answers...${prompt}
  7864: '......${prompt}'
  7865: ${name-player}, listen.${prompt}
  7866: I can't help but wonder if the body of this letter isn't the same as the letter you delivered to Ulbrecht at the professor's request.${prompt}
  7867: Of course, this is pure conjecture, but I believe that when these incidents first began, the professor may have...${prompt}
  7868: No, no, it couldn't possibly be...${prompt}
  7869: |-
    But there are more important questions at hand here.
    We must use our reason. Let us assume that the body of this letter is the same as the sealed letter that you delivered to Ulbrecht.
    Then perhaps it may provide us with a hint in our search for him.${prompt}
  7870: |-
    See, look here.
    Where it says “banishing stones”...
    Could this possibly be referring to silver ore?${prompt}
  7871: |-
    How do I figure that, you ask?
    Well, it's something Ulbrecht told me before when he gave me a pair of earrings.${prompt}
  7872: The mystical properties of silver are such that it functions as a sort of protective charm against evil.${prompt}
  7873: |-
    And here...the “fountainheads” it refers to.
    Veins of silver and springs of water... I know of only one such place.${prompt}
  7874: The Ruhotz Silvermines. Could Ulbrecht possibly be there?${prompt}
  7875: |-
    If you don't mind, ${name-player}, I'd like to hold onto this letter for further examination.
    Given time, I may be able to coax another hint out of it.${prompt}
  7876: What's this? The formula of this stratagem doesn't seem right...${prompt}
  7877: I've never seen anything quite like this.${prompt}
  7878: Wait a moment. It may still be too early in your training to comprehend such cryptic writing, but I'll transcribe a copy for you.${prompt}
  7879: But we still have another problem...${prompt}
  7880: The only entrance that I know of into the Ruhotz Silvermines was sealed following the Battle of Grauberg to preserve the peace.${prompt}
  7881: Think... Think...${prompt}
  7882: |-
    That's it! The formula! The one which we were just examining.
    That's the only thing that can explain the values that appear to be coordinates.
    It must be related to a stratagem of porting to the Silvermines!${prompt}
  7883: If my supposition is correct, the formula and the stratagem that works in tandem with it should be written out somewhere in Grauberg!${prompt}
  7884: |-
    Go and find that formula, ${name-player}!
    It will almost certainly take you to the Ruhotz Silvermines.${prompt}
  7885: |-
    I'll make all of this known to the Allied Forces headquarters right away!
    They may send aid!${prompt}
  7886: |-
    You lost the transcription that I made for you?
    Well, it sure is a good thing that I hung onto that letter instead of you!${prompt}
  7887: |-
    Alright, then. I'll transcribe you another copy, I suppose.
    But I'm all out of ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  7888: |-
    This won't do at all...
    Would you happen to have any, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  7889: |-
    I'd like nothing more than to make another copy of this formula for you, but unfortunately I'm out of ${item-singular: 0[2]}.
    There's a lot of writing in a very small space... It must be of the finest quality, I'm afraid.${prompt}
  7890: |-
    Things have been so hectic lately I haven't had the chance to resupply.
    Would you happen to have any, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  7891: |-
    A ${item-singular: 0[2]}!
    Give me just a moment then, and I'll make you another copy of the professor's letter.${prompt}
  7892: |-
    Oh, ${name-player}, I'm so glad you're safe.
    I heard from the investigating officer at the Allied Forces' headquarters.${prompt}
  7893: |-
    Apparently, they are going to rule all of the disappearances as a mass desertion.
    They have no means of confirming anything, and they feel they can attribute it all to wartime stress...${prompt}
  7894: Even more disturbing, I have learned that once the war is over, the grimoire is to be banned by all three nations.${prompt}
  7895: By the way, there is something I'd like to give to you, ${name-player}, in the absence of your teacher.${prompt}
  7896: |-
    It does me great honor to announce that you are hereby the last graduating pupil of the Schultz School of Martial Theory, Eldieme Necropolis Campus.
    Congratulations!${prompt}
  7897: |-
    You have faced many trials in getting here today, but the war continues.
    We scholars still have a great deal of work to do.${prompt}
  7898: |-
    “To know is to act”!
    Let us show the world what we scholars know!${prompt}
  7899: |-
    Well, if it isn't my prize pupil.
    I trust that your studies in the Schultz School of Martial Theory have been serving you well afield.${prompt}
  7900: |-
    Incidentally, you are familiar with the technique we call “Tabula Rasa,” are you not?
    A monumental breakthrough in the history of our school, it allows us scholars to wield strategems with nary a concern for charges.${prompt}
  7901: |-
    Already knew that, you say? Well, then perhaps you're ready for the honors class.
    Ready your parchment and quill--it's time for one of Professor Erlene's acclaimed lectures!${prompt}
  7902: |-
    Mastering Tabula Rasa, you see, allows the scholar unprecedented options in combat.
    Strategems may be combined and battle tactics altered at will to account for subtle ebbs and flows in the tide of battle.${prompt}
  7903: |-
    Needless to say, it falls upon you, the scholar, to use this heightened potential effectively.
    With your time limited, simply unleashing your strategies haphazardly will afford you few benefits, if any at all.${prompt}
  7904: It is precisely this discernment and poise under pressure that separates the great tacticians of our time from the multitudes who excel in the classroom but flounder on the field of battle.${prompt}
  7905: But let us return to the topic at hand.${prompt}
  7906: No doubt you've heard tales of warriors who--in the times of greatest crisis--were able to summon heretofore-untapped reserves of strength.${prompt}
  7907: |-
    One might say that Tabula Rasa serves a similar function for us.
    Of course, its benefits are of the mental and psychological variety rather than the physical, but nevertheless...${prompt}
  7908: |-
    Now, where was I? Ah, yes!
    The rub is that we scholars can only sustain this state of heightened faculties for a short duration.
    As the proverb goes: make use of time, let not advantage slip.${prompt}
  7909: |-
    It is akin to how sprinting at full speed will quickly leave our bodies wanting for breath.
    Of course, even this is not truly “full” speed, as those subconscious reserves of strength remain largely dormant.${prompt}
  7910: |-
    And what if we were to cast off the fetters of our mortal bodies entirely, gaining mental and physical powers beyond our wildest comprehension!?
    Yes, soon the day will come that...!${prompt}
  7911: |-
    ...Ah, but forgive me. My research has afforded me precious little time for respite of late.
    I fear my faculties are fraying.${prompt}
  7912: |-
    The remainder of today's lesson you may glean from these tomes.
    To wit, they detail two arcane spells wieldable only by those in the heightened mental state of which I previously spoke.${prompt}
  7913: |-
    And that concludes our class for the day.
    Study well your texts, ${name-player}, and they will not fail you afield.
    Remember: the day a scholar stops learning is the day ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] draws ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] final breath!${prompt}
  7914: ${name-player} learns Embrava and Kaustra!${prompt}
  7915: 'DEBUG: Press a button to continue.${prompt}'
  7916: '　　 ${wait-animation: 1}'
  7917: |-
    Never-ending is the cycle of torment and death.
    Ruthless is its grasp on even those poor souls whose only wish is for eternal rest.${prompt}
  7918: |-
    The lives and dreams that are shattered on the battlefield...
    And the burden of sorrow that is inherited by loved ones left behind...
    It is of this that we bards sing, lest the lessons they teach us be forgotten for all time.${prompt}
  7919: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}...!
    Thank you kindly, friend. With this offering, those who have been laid to rest here may finally know true peace.${prompt}
  7920: Have something to send?${prompt}
  7921: You hear an odd skittering sound coming from beneath the sarcophagus...${prompt}
  7922: Hey, what do you think you're doing down here?${prompt}
  7923: An odd sound, you say?${prompt}
  7924: |-
    I don't hear anything except your impending doom.
    This place is dangerous. I suggest you make tracks.${prompt}
  7925: '!?${prompt}'
  7926: What in the...!
  7927: |-
    An Antica!?
    How did that get in here...?${prompt}
  7928: |-
    You're one of Senator Werner's hired swords, aren't you?
    Let's hear what you have to say about this.${prompt}
  7929: |-
    Hmph.
    So, the Mythril Musketeers finally tracked us down...
    I knew Engelhart was getting sloppy.${prompt}
  7930: That Antica was being held here by order of the senator.${prompt}
  7931: By order of the senator!?${prompt}
  7932: He believed that the awesome military might of the Antican Empire could be harnessed for the war effort...${prompt}
  7933: '...${prompt}'
  7934: |-
    An alliance with those butchers?
    Even the ambitious senator would not suggest such madness.${prompt}
  7935: It is true that the slumbering legions of the Antica are so incredibly vast that their numbers would easily tip the balance of this conflict.${prompt}
  7936: But to have dealings with the ancestral enemies of the Galka...${prompt}
  7937: There was no idealistic plan to negotiate the Antica's integration into the Allied Forces of Altana.${prompt}
  7938: |-
    Senator Werner meant to control the antmen using an improved version of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    This prisoner was nothing more than a test subject!${prompt}
  7939: Good Goddess...${prompt}
  7940: No such abomination will take place while I have the strength to wield a blade!${prompt}
  7941: War Cloud, no!${prompt}
  7942: Never speak that name again, Volker...${prompt}
  7943: |-
    We must treat this beastman as we would any prisoner of war.
    Besides, it barely has the strength to--${prompt}
  7944: '!!!'
  7945: |-
    Do not underestimate the Antica.
    They are bred to be killing machines...${prompt}
  7946: |-
    Your precious ethics and morals do not exist for Antican soldiers.
    One tiny slip, and they would turn on us without the slightest hesitation.${prompt}
  7947: |-
    You understand their nature well, Galka.
    There is little point in taking defeated Antica as prisoners--even should they manage to return to their homeland, a fate crueler than death awaits them.${prompt}
  7948: And the senator wished to control such unfeeling monsters.${prompt}
  7949: It's hardly surprising that President Prien and Chairman Pale Eagle chose to oppose this reckless plan.${prompt}
  7950: The president knew of this...?${prompt}
  7951: |-
    It seems quite a few things escaped your notice, Musketeer.
    Perhaps you should discuss it with him upon your return.${prompt}
  7952: |-
    My apologies for tailing you, ${name-player}.
    Your ties to this mercenary organization were our best lead.${prompt}
  7953: |-
    The Musketeers were actually well aware of Englehart's position as an intermediary.
    It was in our best interest to allow him to operate unhindered--at least until we had what we needed.${prompt}
  7954: |-
    To be honest, we began to doubt your integrity when you spoke with him again.
    However, that female agent seemed to have no idea who you were.${prompt}
  7955: |-
    You obviously have no deeper connection with this whole affair than the one you described.
    Once again, I apologize for our suspicions.${prompt}
  7956: '...${prompt}'
  7957: I never would have believed the senator capable of something like this...${prompt}
  7958: We must report to the captain at once.${prompt}
  7959: I am Heptachiond, a friar from the San d'Orian Cathedral. I am here to pray for the departed.${prompt}
  7960: Many devout believers of the Goddess have been laid to rest here. Sadly, though, the raging war has left their graves desecrated and in ruin.${prompt}
  7961: There is naught I can do for these poor souls, save to light incense as an offering to their memory, and pray for their undisturbed, eternal rest. But alas, I have almost run out of incense.${prompt}
  7962: A friend used to bring me incense, but I have been unable to contact him since he was posted to Fort Karugo-Narugo.${prompt}
  7963: This special incense is handmade by my friend himself, and is imbued with his prayers for the departed. If only I could find a way to acquire more of them...${prompt}
  7964: 'Oh? Could that possibly be ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} you have in your possession?${prompt}'
  7965: Then you have been to Fort Karugo-Narugo and met my friend. It was he who used to offer prayers here.${prompt}
  7966: Even though my friend does not share the same faith as the San d'Orians interred here, he would come here to pray for them all the same. He is truly an admirable person, a model to us all.${prompt}
  7967: But after the outbreak of the war, it became increasingly difficult for him to travel here as in the past. Under these circumstances, I felt it my duty to offer the incense on his behalf.${prompt}
  7968: If some misfortune were to befall me, there would be no one left to honor the memory of the departed.${prompt}
  7969: This graveyard must not be allowed to turn into a sorrowful place haunted by anguished souls.${prompt}
  7970: I will see to it that these faithful children of Altana have the peace they deserve. This is my gift to you. Please accept it.${prompt}

  8128: The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called “Voidwalkers.” Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt}
  8129: |-
    Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.
    This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt}
  8130: Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt}
  8131: A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt}
  8132: Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt}
  8133: |-
    Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.
    Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt}
  8134: Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt}
  8135: Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt}
  8136: However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt}
  8137: |-
    When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.
    These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt}
  8138: Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt}
  8139: The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt}
  8140: |-
    Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.
    Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt}
  8141: As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt}
  8142: Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt}
  8143: Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt}
  8144: After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt}
  8145: Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt}
  8146: Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  8147: While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  8148: Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt}
  8149: Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt}
  8150: Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt}
  8151: Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt}
  8152: Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt}
  8153: The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt}
  8154: The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt}
  8155: Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt}
  8156: 'Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt}'

    Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts.
    By infusing atmacite to one's body using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.${prompt}
  8158: Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}
  8159: Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.${prompt}
  8160: Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.${prompt}
  8161: As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.${prompt}
  8162: Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.${prompt}
  8163: 'Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level ${number: 0}.${prompt}'
  8164: All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.${prompt}

  8166: Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.${prompt}
  8167: Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.${prompt}
