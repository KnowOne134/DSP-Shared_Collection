    Atma is most accurately described as the crystalline agglomeration of an Abyssean creature's soul.
    Through painstaking research, we infusionists have discovered a way to imbue ordinary people such as yourself with its power.${prompt}
  7432: Infusion makes possible the augmentation of individuals, granting them powers particular to the creature from which the atma is sourced.${prompt}

  7437: Strike at a foe's weakness, and it will drop different spoils, often more valuable than usual. Among them you may find atma.${prompt}

  7439: |-
    For instance, there are monsters known to be weak against magic-based weapon skills.

    Greetings. I am an atma fabricant--or, to the layman, one who fabricates atma.
    I can synthesize atma from the memories of adventure stored deep within your body and soul.
    If you have need of my services, you need only speak the word.${prompt}

    Ask for something?
    ${selection-lines}
    No thanks.
    Synthetic atma?
    My memories?
    Show me the atma.${prompt}
  7471: As you are no doubt aware, the substance we call atma is a crystalline agglomeration of soul energy that can be harvested from the bodies of fallen Abyssean fiends.${prompt}
  7472: |-
    The abundant power that it imbues when infused into our bodies is not in question.
    The perilous means by which it must be acquired, however, leaves something to be desired.${prompt}
  7473: |-
    After all, bolstering the strength of one man means little if ten others must lose their lives in the process.
    Thus was the impetus behind our research: to discover a means for extracting atma from resources at our immediate disposal.${prompt}
  7474: |-
    We experimented with nearly every substance in sight--be it animal, vegetable, or mineral.
    Yet each time, the atma produced was small, fragile, and entirely absent of the power we sought.${prompt}
  7475: |-
    Then, one day, we hit upon the obvious answer that we had so long overlooked...ourselves.
    Yes, the atma extracted from our own bodies--particularly those richly possessed of experiences and memories--these housed a power rivalling that harvested from the most vicious of fiends.${prompt}
  7476: If you possess such memories, then I can bring forth the latent power that resides within you as well.${prompt}
  7477: |-
    Fear not, for there is everything to gain and nothing to lose.
    Save for some cruor, that is...${prompt}
  7478: |-
    Curious, is it not?
    That potent physical energy can be extracted from such a tenuous, intangible thing...${prompt}
  7479: |-
    But the strength our memories and experiences give us is real, if all too easily overlooked.
    Once isolated, it is simply a matter of recalling it, solidifying it, and bringing it to the fore.${prompt}
  7480: |-
    Surely you understand of what it is I speak, yes?
    Your greatest accomplishments--those that make others stand in wonderment and admiration when you they hear your name.${prompt}
  7481: |-
    We summon forth the energies from the deepest recesses of your psyche, and infuse it into the cruor you carry.
    The resultant agglomeration of organic mineral and soul energy is synthetic atma.${prompt}
  7482: |-
    Mind you, the deeper and more puissant your energies, the more cruor will be necessary to contain it all.
    If you wish to have me assay the powers that lie dormant within you, simply speak the word.${prompt}
  7483: |-
    Very well. We shall see what latent powers you possess.
    Stand still and clear your mind...${prompt}
  7484: |-
    Yes...it is as I thought...

    The device we know as the martello was first developed by military engineers many years past, during an age of great war.
    Martellos serve to keep combatants fighting fit, healing their wounds and restoring their mental energies.${prompt}

    This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is the lifeblood of the martello, and the source of its curative powers.

    What ki～nd of a predicamentaru, you ask?
    Why, one of our supply convoys was ambushed-wambushed on its way to the western camp!${prompt}

    Horrifying, isn't it? They barely-warely escaped with their lives!
    Here on base, we've got the Cardians to protect us, but out in the wilds those fiends can squash us like we were overripe rolanberries!

    And so who does it fall to, to take this lemon of a situation and make a scrumptious soufflé out of it?

  7907: |-
    Those Rhinostery poseurs claim it to be their invention, but they're full of more hot air than an oven baking one of my famed rolanberry tarts.
    Ahem! In any event, one shot into its roots and any tree should readily return to full fruit-bearing glory.${prompt}
  7908: |-
    You'll find a number of trees bearing their roots on the path leading to the Meriphataud Mountains.
    Take your pick of them! For it is not the ingredients that make the dish, but the skill of the chef who prepares them!${prompt}
  7909: |-
    But not all will partake from Piketo-Puketo's table of plenty!
    Called my rolanberry tarts too tart, did you? My macarons too mushy? Oh yes, I remember you all!
    You will beg for forgiveness, or starve wishing the goddess had blessed you with a proper palate!${prompt}

    My dear friend Baladanzo and I thought we would go there, and leave behind this terrible, terrible place.
    But the road was sealed with a mountain of rubble!${prompt}

    The ground rumbled...rocks started to fall. I thought we would be crushed, and ran away as fast as I could.
    But Baladanzo...<sniff>...he wouldn't come with me.${prompt}
  7926: “I hear voices, lad! Voices on the other side of this wall! I'm a-gonna dig on through and take you to Mhaura like I promised, just you wait!” he said.${prompt}
  7927: |-
    The ground...<sniff>...it wouldn't stop shaking.
    I was so scared...that's why I ran back here.
    But Baladanzo...he wouldn't look back. He just started tossing aside rocks and shouting, bellowing...<sniff>...like a madman...${prompt}
  7928: |-
    Please, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady]... You must check on Baladanzo for me.
    He was my only friend back in Windurst. Without him, I just...<sniff>...${prompt}

    Yes? What is it?
    Diegai sent you, you say?${prompt}

  7934: Poor Baladanzo... He used to be such a...<sniff>...gentle soul...${prompt}
  7935: |-
    Still, it's touching somehow... He's trying to bring a mountain down...for me...
    I don't suppose it will help, but I heard that those rotting bog bodies have the ability to cut through solid stone...${prompt}

    Fall! Fall, I say!!! Graaaaaaaaa--
    Hm? ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?${prompt}
  7937: |-
    This will help, but alone it will not serve to bring this mountain of rubble down.

    This makes ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} you have brought me.

    This is it, friend.

    No...it cannot be! The wall still stands before me?

    ...I see.
    Baladanzo was a steady hand in my life for so long, but perhaps it is time I learned to take care of myself.

  7946: |-
    Friend, you have returned.
    Let me share with you what I have learned since our last encounter.${prompt}
  7947: |-
    Do you remember how I spoke of voices?
    Voices calling me from the other side of this mountain?${prompt}
  7948: |-
    Not long after you left, a curious young 'Taru lass donning a cloak appeared here.
    I did not see her come. It was almost as if she appeared out of thin air.${prompt}
  7949: |-
    She lay down on the ground before me and closed her eyes, as if to sleep. But then she spoke...
    “Did you know, mistaru?” she said. “A young boy and his guardian came through this way, bound for Mhaura.
    That was when the skies came tumbly-wumbling down...”${prompt}
  7950: |-
    “The boy escaped, but the man who had cared for him since he was a wee tyke was soon buried under a mountain of rubble.
    And yet, his spirit found no peace, for in his heartaru of hearts, he felt he had let his loved one down.
    What he did not realize was that his love had already nurture-wurtured within the child enough inner strength to last a lifetime...”${prompt}
  7951: |-
    Perhaps it is time I...let go.
    Still, it is strange. In her sleep, she muttered, “No need to thank me, but I'll take a grilled hare if you've gotaru one.”
    Whatever could she have meant...?${prompt}
  7952: |-
    Minister Rukususu, Leepe-Hoppe, Doctor Yoran-Oran...
    I do hope they're all right...${prompt}
  7953: Kerutoto? She's sleeping blissfully as always, no doubt.${prompt}
  7954: Hail there! Have you perchance caught sight of a garishly pink-colored fiend in these parts?${prompt}
  7955: |-

    ${selection-lines}
    I have not.
    I have!${prompt}
  7956: |-
    Well, drat! Wherever did it scamper off to?
    At this rate, I'll never finish my research!${prompt}
  7957: |-
    You have? What luck!
    This could just be the breakthrough in my research I've been waiting for!${prompt}
  7958: |-
    What research, you say? Why, my study of the Abyssean ecosystem, of course!
    It started out as a hobby, but recently I'm convinced that it just might be the key to our survival.${prompt}
  7959: |-
    Perhaps you've noticed that there are all sorts of curious new creatures sprouting out of the ground these days.
    One in particular has caught my fancy--a pinkish thing that bears a striking resemblance to the mandragora we know so well.${prompt}
  7960: |-
    If only I could study it up close, I just might be able to figure out where the fiends come from--and how to send them back there for good.
    But to do that, I need a live sample.${prompt}
  7961: |-
    If you'd be willing to help me procure one, speak to Kenapa-Keppa outside.
    Nothing would thrill him more than to be able to fill you in on the details!${prompt}

    But of course!
    Since you've been such a dutiful assistant, why don't I enlighten you as to my latest findings?${prompt}
  7973: My experiments have shown that when battling the beasts that roam the canyon here, it'd behoove you to formulate a proper plan of attack!${prompt}
  7974: |-
    They each have their weaknesses, you see.
    Send a particularly unpleasant attack or spell their way, and you just might stop them in their tracks, or scare them into forgetting some of their most potent abilities.${prompt}
  7975: |-
    You might also want to experiment with killing them in all many of creative ways.
    Me? A sadist? Of course not! I'm just saying, my research suggests that doing so might prove fruitful!${prompt}
  7976: |-
    We're...sorry...
    So...so...sorry...${prompt}

    You wouldn't possibly be in the mood for tracking another one down for me, would you?

    They say there's a cactus that yields water only after sundown. Water that can cure the rarest of illnesses...

    The cat burglar? Chieftainness o' cutpurrrses and pickpocket nonparrreil?

    Wonderful!

  8036: |-
    The Cardians serve us well, but with the strain of this harsh environment, their condition is known to degenerataru rapidly.

    Our contact on site assures me that he's in tip-top shape, and indeed just helped to fend off an onslaught of fiends.${prompt}
  8042: |-
    Well, better safe than sorry-worry, I suppose...
    I'll have a thorough checkup performed, just in case.${prompt}

    ${selection-lines}
    Good to go!
    Just to be safe...${prompt}
  8050: |-
    Well, if it isn't ${name-player}, the caulk that keeps the survivors of Windurst together.
    You've become a real hero to the survivors. Go ahead, give yourself a good pataru on the back!${prompt}
  8051: |-
    But if I know you, you're far from satisfied.
    No～siree! You're thinking that you'd like to help us in even bigger, better ways!
    Well? Am I right?${prompt}
  8052: |-
    Is she right?
    ${selection-lines}
    Truly!
    Totally!
    Indubitably!${prompt}
  8053: |-
    Why, did I detect a momentaru of hesitation in your answer just now?
    You're supposed to be a hero, ${name-player}! Stop dither-withering and act like one!${prompt}
  8054: Well, of co～urse I am!${prompt}
  8055: |-
    Now that we understand each other, look at this here.
    It's a listaru of the most fearsome fiends terrorizing our five camps.${prompt}
  8056: |-
    Cuelebre, Adze, Minhocao, Chukwa, and...Mictli...Metlec...Mictlantecuhtli!
    Phew...that last one's a mouthful!${prompt}
  8057: |-
    A～nyway, these five beastly brutarus are wreaking some serious havoc on our poor camps.
    That's why Kupipi needs you to pick 'em off! Take 'em down! Send 'em packing-whacking!${prompt}
  8058: |-
    I know you're a busy ${choice-player-gender}[fellow/lady], so let's say that just one of them will suffice.
    Bring back proof of your feataru, and everyone in the camps should be able to breathe a bit easier.
    Get it? Got it? Go～od!${prompt}
  8059: |-
    And I'll still take those ${item-plural: 0[2]} if you can get them!
    ${number: 1} or so should do the trick.${prompt}
  8060: |-
    Why...that's an arrow from the quiver of Semih Lafihna.
    Wherever did you find it?${prompt}
  8061: '......${prompt}'
  8062: Semih Lafihna, Zubaba... The Star Sibyl...${prompt}
  8063: |-
    I have not seen them since the walls of Windurst fell...
    I can only pray that they are alive...<sniff>...somewhere... B-but...${prompt}
  8064: |-
    Get a hold of yourself, Kupipi! It's not like you to be a sulky-wulking sourpuss!
    Besides, it would take more than an overgrown turtle or a rotting sack of bones to bring down the protectarus of Windurst!${prompt}
  8065: |-
    Anyway, thanks to you, Kupipi can rest just a li～ttle bit easier tonight.
    You've earned yourself a break, but not for too long! There are still other nasties on the prowl!${prompt}
  8066: |-
    As for this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, I'll be keeping it well out of sightaru.
    Why, we don't want to send the others into a frenzy-wenzy.${prompt}
  8067: |-
    And do try to bring something a little less disturbing next time, will you?
    The gore-stained, blood-dripping-wipping scalps of our foes should suffice!${prompt}
  8068: |-
    Congra～tulations! You've done a bang-up job, ${name-player}.
    But dangerous fiends are still on the prowl. We must stay vigilantaru!${prompt}
  8069: |-
    Ye～s? Don't tell me you've forgotten the monstarus you're supposed to be hunting!
    <Sigh>... What would you do without Kupipi?${prompt}
  8070: |-
    You there! Come here!
    And hu～rry now! We don't have all day!${prompt}
  8071: |-
    Hmmm... Hm～mmm!
    Just as I thought...a stranger, and a shady-looking one at that.
    But that's not importantaru right now!${prompt}
  8072: |-
    I am Kupipi, trusted scribe and all-'round-sweetheartaru of Heavens Tower...or at least, I was.
    What do they call you?${prompt}
  8073: |-
    ${name-player}, is it?
    That's a curious name.${prompt}
  8074: Anyhow, l～isten up, because Kupipi has just the job for you.${prompt}
  8075: |-
    What's that? You didn't come here to work, you say?
    Well, excu～se me, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady]! If you haven't noticed, we're engaged in a fightaru for our lives here!${prompt}
  8076: So zippy-wip that lip and listen to what Kupipi has to say!${prompt}
  8077: Ahem. Before I go on, you a～re familiar with martellos, are you not?${prompt}
  8078: |-
    You know martellos?
    ${selection-lines}
    Did you say marshmallows?
    I sure do.${prompt}
  8079: |-
    No, no, no～! Have you got popotos where your brains should be?
    Martellos, I said! Martellos!${prompt}
  8080: |-
    Boy, it's a good thing you ran into Kupipi when you did.
    Let me take a momentaru to enlighten you.${prompt}
  8081: Martellos are these oversized iron boxy-woxy contraptions that you see scattered from place to place.${prompt}
  8082: |-
    From the side, they almost look like a giantaru ${item-singular: 0[2]}.
    Pretty cute, don't you think?${prompt}
  8083: |-
    You fill it up with a magic liquid something-or-other, and it'll do nifty-wifty things like heal you and restore your magical energies.
    Se～e? Aren't you glad you asked me?${prompt}
  8084: Splendid! And here Kupipi thought she was going to have to tell you e～verything.${prompt}
  8085: |-
    Anyhoo, you'll find martello-wellos located all over this canyon.
    I need you to check around and make sure that their fuel is in good supply.${prompt}
  8086: |-
    If they're running empty, you'll want to fill them again.
    But you can talk to one of our machine outfittarus about that.${prompt}
  8087: |-
    ...One more thing. Now, this isn't a job, but a favor.
    It goes without saying-waying, but ever since the Federation fell, we Windurstians have been going through rough times.${prompt}
  8088: |-
    So please, stranger. Talk to those you encounter, and do what you can to help.
    The survivors will be most appreciative of any supportaru you can provide.${prompt}
  8089: |-
    Prove yourself a friend, and you will be loved and exaltarued by all!
    The greatest hero that our suffer-wuffering people have seen!${prompt}
  8090: |-
    Second only, that is, to the sweet and charming girl who found you...
    Er, ahem! A～nyway...${prompt}
  8091: |-
    Perhaps you've seen the stodgy-wodgy-looking types posted by those funny dancing stone thingies.
    Confluence purveyors? Or something like that.${prompt}
  8092: |-
    After you talk with the outfittaru, you'll be heading outside camp.
    If you're wise, you'll have a chat with the powerflux conveyor before you venture-wenture into the canyon.${prompt}
  8093: Well, I beli～eve that's all Kupipi has to say to you.${prompt}
  8094: |-
    Now get a move on! You've got a whole nation counting on you!
    Give 'em hell!${prompt}
  8095: |-
    The people are suffering and need your help, ${name-player}!
    Do what you can, and tell them Kupipi sent you!${prompt}
  8096: |-
    Looking to do some shopping-wopping, eh?
    Well, we don't have shops per se, but there's a trader over by the banner with some provisions for sale.${prompt}
  8097: I figure she can outfitaru you with most anything you need, so long as you've got the cruor to pay-the-day for it.${prompt}
  8098: Gil, you say? I'm afraid there hasn't been much use for that of late.${prompt}
  8099: |-
    Take down-with-a-frown one of those Abyssean fiends, and you'll find they drop a reddish gold dusty-crust--that's cruor.
    Back when the three nations still stood, the stuff was nowhere to be found, but now we literally can't live without it.${prompt}
  8100: You'll be needing it to power the confluxes as well, so you'll want to keep a healthy-wealthy supply.${prompt}
  8101: |-
    Just a ways ahead of here, you'll find a fiery-wiery defensive barrier that we call a searing ward.
    It keeps us here safe from the dangers that lurk beyond.${prompt}
  8102: |-
    Before striking out into the canyon, you should talk to our conflux surveyor and have yourself endowed with visitantaru status.
    Trust me, you won't want to leave home without it!${prompt}
  8103: |-
    I remember like it was yesterday-ay-ay.
    I was in my lab, where a particularly accommodating adventurer had come to me with a lovely bout of the plague.
    That's when I heard a rumbling-tumbling crash and a hideous scream-eam-eam...${prompt}
  8104: |-
    The next thing I knew, there were hideous creatures bearing-wearing down on us from all directions.
    The War Warlocks, the Patriarch Protectors, the Sibyl Guards and the Mithran Mercenaries...Tarutaru, Mithra, and Cardian alike foughtaru bravely, but the enemy came in oodles and scoodles...${prompt}
  8105: |-
    It soon became clear that the fight was hopeless, and we were ordered to take sheltaru in Heavens Tower.
    Oh, it was a terrible-werrible scene! The Star Sibyl in tears, declaring our beloved Windurst lost as she summoned what remained of her strength to incant the teleportation spell that would lead her people to safety...${prompt}
  8106: |-
    ...But it failed, I'm afraid.
    The teleportation itself was a success-ess-ess, but we were sent scattered helter-skelter to all manner of bleak and hostile destinations.${prompt}
  8107: Those of us in this camp are just a handful of survivors who were fortunataru enough to end up together-wether.${prompt}
  8108: |-
    But I don't remember seeing you back in the tower.
    Wherever-wever did you come from?${prompt}
  8109: |-
    Hey! Want to hear a secrrret?
    I heard that if you beat up on enough of those scary monsters in the same place, they'll get all grrrumpy and call in their friends!${prompt}
  8110: |-
    Those friends'll be even scarrrier than the ones before, but if you leave them alone they'll just walk away.
    Isn't that funny? Of course, my mama could take them all without brrreakin' a sweat...${prompt}
  8111: |-
    See that curious stone structure all glowing and spinning-winning over there?
    That's what we call a veridical conflux.${prompt}
  8112: |-
    Don't let it intimidataru you--it's actually the handiest pile of rocks around.
    You can warp from one to another in the blink of an eye, you see!${prompt}
  8113: |-
    The only catch is that you'll need to meld-weld with a conflux before you can teleport to it.
    They're scattered all over the canyon, so you'll want to explore and make contactaru with as many you can.
    It'll make travel easy-breezy!${prompt}
  8114: |-
    You'll also want to be sure you have cruor on hand.
    Otherwise your long journey will have all been for naughtaru.${prompt}
  8115: |-
    ${name-player}? Never heard of ${choice-player-gender}[her/him].
    Oh, that's you?${prompt}
  8116: |-
    You'll have to forgive me.
    These days, one stranger wandering into our camp looks much like the nextaru.${prompt}
  8117: |-
    Our people might seem a bit distant, but that's part and parcel-warcel of living in these harsh times.
    Help them in their struggle, and they'll learn to trust you in good time.${prompt}
  8118: |-
    ${name-player}-Bo${name-player}? Was that the third minister of the Manustery?
    Oh, I'm sorry. That was you, wasn't it?${prompt}
  8119: |-
    You're not a complete stranger-wanger these days, but I fear you haven't made much of an impression.
    Keep working at it, though, and your day will come.${prompt}
  8120: |-
    Wait, don't tell me... ${name-player}, was it?
    I've finally-winally managed put a face to the name.${prompt}
  8121: |-
    Why, I heard a conversation about you just the other day.
    “A bit of a bumbler-wumbler, but I suppose ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] means well...” they said.
    It may not sound like much, but you're on the right track. Now is no time to rest in your efforts!${prompt}
  8122: |-
    Oh, hullo there, ${name-player}.
    I was just talking to a fellow who seemed to have taken quite a liking to you.${prompt}
  8123: |-
    Seems it's not often that a stranger has made such an earnestaru attempt to help out.
    I knew you had it in you, ${name-player}! Keep working and others will learn to appreciate the work you've done!${prompt}
  8124: |-
    Well, if it isn't ${name-player}!
    Don't go getting a swelly-welled head, but you've got yourself the makings of your own little fan club these days.${prompt}
  8125: |-
    Just goes to show that people appreciataru the good deeds you've done.
    But I have a feeling we haven't seen the limits of what you can do. Keep showing us what you've got!${prompt}
  8126: |-
    ${name-player}! What a rare treataru!
    Why, I hear your name everywhere I go these days.${prompt}
  8127: |-
    People can't stop talking about how much easier their lives have been since you showed up.
    No surprise to me, of course. Why, since the first day I spotty-wotted you, I knew this day would come!${prompt}
  8128: |-
    I am Shaz Norem, and I have been following your career with grrreat interest.
    If you would hear an objective evaluation of your efforts, then listen well...${prompt}
  8129: Your accomplishments have not gone unnoticed.${prompt}
  8130: This is but a small token, but with it comes the gratitude of a nation's people.${prompt}
  8131: |-
    Thank you, friend.
    You have been as a torrrch to a people who were groping in darkness.${prompt}
  8132: |-
    This land is still frrraught with danger.
    Be safe in your travels.${prompt}
  8133: |-
    Look at those fools, trrraipsing about without a care in the world.
    We didn't fight tooth and nail to save their worrrthless hides just so they could throw them away like this!${prompt}
  8134: |-
    That goes for you too! If you've got any sense, you'll stay quiet, and stay on guarrrd.
    Grrr...sometimes I wonder if that teleportation accident transported everyone's brains into one o' those fissures...${prompt}
  8135: I was separated from my colleagues at the consulate when the teleportation spell went awry.${prompt}
  8136: |-
    Do you suppose they found their way home to Bastok?
    I do hope everyone's safe and sound...${prompt}
  8137: You didn't see a drrreary 'Taru in a tunic 'round these parts, did ya?${prompt}
  8138: |-
    Always goin' on about rrresearch this, research that.
    When you can understand half a word he says, that is...${prompt}

    I don't care what you'rrre studyin', it can't be more important than the lives of your friends!
    My Terrible Tigresses... I hope they're alrrright...${prompt}

    Other camps?
    Why yes, I believe that one lies north of here, and the other a fair ways to the southwest.${prompt}
  8141: |-
    Still, I am struck by the Windurstians' utter lack of anything resembling a cooperative spirit.
    In times like this, unity among countrymen is key to survival.
    Surely you would agree, friend?${prompt}
  8142: The shame! The terrrible, utterrr shame of it all!${prompt}
  8143: |-
    I am a Sibyl Guard, rrraised from birth to protect the Star Sibyl with my life.

    Is this my punishment for failing in my duty!?
    No! I will not accept this miserrrable fate!${prompt}
  8145: |-
    Can you believe it?
    The Federation lamentably lost, the survivors feebly fighting for their lives, and this child hasn't a care in the whole worldwide world!${prompt}

    Furakku-Norakku!
    Settle down and listen up, I say!${prompt}
  8147: |-
    You learned how to fillingly fuel a martello, did you not?
    Now you must practice! We must be readily ready for when the fiends return!${prompt}

    ...Huaaah...?
    There are scary monsters outside, but Ms. Fuepepe and that scowling Sibyl Guard are even scarier.
