    The effects of controlling regions.
    Regions controlled by other nations.
    Regions under beastman control.${prompt}
  7508: All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt}
  7509: Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt}
  7510: Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt}
  7511: So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt}
  7512: |-
    Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.
    They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt}
  7513: Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt}
  7514: Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt}
  7515: |-
    So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.
    We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt}

    You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.
    Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt}
  7517: |-
    Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.
    The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt}

  7524: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt}
  7525: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt}
  7526: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt}
  7527: Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt}
  7528: Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt}
  7529: Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt}
  7530: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt}
  7531: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt}
  7532: |-
    Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.
    If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt}
  7533: If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt}
  7534: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt}
  7535: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt}
  7536: There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt}
  7537: |-
    Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.

    ${name-player}...
    Now that I have passed from the mortal realm, I have only you to turn to.
    The time left to me is short.
  7887: Thirty years ago, I came into contact with the insidious power of this land, and rose from the grave. However, at the same time, this world laid claim to a part of my soul...${prompt}
  7888: |-
    I have been released from the hate that consumed me, but the half of my soul that was taken captive all those years ago is calling to me...
    It has become a towering darkness. A raging hatred, spawned from the depths of my being...${prompt}
  7889: Very soon I will be drawn into that soul. I no longer have the strength to resist. The soul that was divided will become whole once more, and that rage will take on physical form.${prompt}
  7890: A new Shadow Lord will be born. Surely you have sensed the growing evil? The beastman armies that are imprisoned here are massing for battle. They plan a return to the world of their origin, the realm that exists beneath the light of hope.${prompt}
  7891: |-
    My link to you will soon be severed, so listen carefully.
    Thirty years ago, an expeditionary squad formed from the elite soldiers of each nation was sent to investigate the Northlands. You must have seen their memories when you first laid your hand upon the chunks of magicite.${prompt}
  7892: |-
    Seek out the markings that the expedition members left behind. They will aid you in gaining entrance to this world.
    You must defeat the Shadow Lord before our unification is complete.

  7893: There is an unusual arrangement of branches here.${prompt}
  7894: There is an unusual arrangement of pebbles here.${prompt}
  7895: The strands of grass here have been tied together.${prompt}
  7896: There is an unusual arrangement of leaves on the ground.${prompt}
  7897: |-
    I see you have met with Raogrimm.
    His soul is no longer confined to that incarnation of rage, the Shadow Lord, yet the fact remains that he has committed sins beyond redemption.${prompt}
  7898: In spite of those sins, I still wish to rescue him from the darkness. I no longer have a mortal body with which to act, and so the most I can do is guide you in my stead.${prompt}
  7899: 'You will need the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, a key that bridges the void between Vana''diel and that other world.${prompt}'
  7900: 'It is said that there are items in this world that gain a soul of their own through contact with the thoughts and dreams of other living creatures. The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is one of those items.${prompt}'

  7902: That world is a land now draped in the blackest night. We can pass from one world to the other, but without the physical forms lost to us thirty years ago, there is little we can do to intervene.${prompt}
  7903: Raogrimm is the one who... No, the world has been divided into separate realms through the machinations of the new Shadow Lord.${prompt}
  7904: The Shadow Lord resides in the Xarcabard of the other reality. However, I fear you would be marching to your death should you go to confront him... I ask you to first obtain trophies from four of the alternate realms.${prompt}
  7905: We understand that there is little time to spare. But without a certain degree of power, it will be impossible to traverse the land the Shadow Lord holds in thrall. Show me your strength with the four trophies you bring back.${prompt}
  7906: 'Those whose fate is linked to his world will empower the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to guide you...${prompt}'

  7911: I doubt you'll listen to the words of a traitor, but please, help free him from the bonds of his eternal night...
  7912: Our expedition was supposed to have been an allied effortaru, but not one of us was interested in the fate of the other nations. In our hasty-waste to outdo each other, we failed to see to the heart of the mattaru.${prompt}
  7913: |-
    Our attitudes led to the death of two of our members, and precipitated the birth of the Shadow Lord...
    This sin does not belong on Raogrimm's shoulders alone. We all mustaru atone for our actions.${prompt}
  7914: Please help him. Help Raogrimm escape from his horrid-worrid darkness, forever this time.
  7915: Humes and Galka have never been the best of friends. I used to think that was just the way it was, and always would be.${prompt}
  7916: I figured I'd be causing myself grrrief if I stuck my whiskers into other nations' problems. My next catnap was all that mattered to me in those days. Ignorrrance is bliss, as they say.${prompt}
  7917: Responsibility for Raogrimm's trrransformation lies with all of us who traveled with him on that expedition. By sharing the blame for the crimes he committed as the Shadow Lord, we can finally call ourselves his trrrue companions.${prompt}
  7918: |-
    Let me help you on your path. May guiding light fill this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    Raogrimm's fate is in your hands.
  7919: There is a broken branch thrust into the ground here.${prompt}
  7920: There is a symbol carved into the rock here.${prompt}
  7921: I have been waiting for you.${prompt}
  7922: |-
    Do you remember the last words Raogrimm spoke to you? "The link will soon be severed"...
    Do you understand the significance of these words?${prompt}
  7923: |-
    When the soul that was divided is whole once again, towering rage will take on physical form...
    Yes, a new Shadow Lord will be born. Even I will no longer hear his voice.${prompt}
  7924: Even now, I can barely feel the emanations of Raogrimm's faltering spirit. When those emanations fade completely, he will be...${prompt}
  7925: The Xarcabard of that other realm is shrouded in a vast darkness, preventing contact from the outside. Even those of us without material bodies are unable to penetrate that mist of eternal night.${prompt}
  7926: "Until that mist clears, I cannot guide you to Xarcabard. \nThe next place you must venture is the twin of Vana'diel's Beaucedine. There you will find the last trophy to complete the set of keys we need.${prompt}"
  7927: |-
    You must obtain the last trophy.
    All five trophies combined with our power will create a synergistic force, allowing us to part the shroud for a few precious moments. It will open a path between worlds.${prompt}
  7928: |-
    Take care, my brave adventurer.
    May the blessings of Altana guide and protect you...
  7929: |-
    Even after the blackest night, the golden sun always rises to begin a new morning.
    This troubled land will soon have its dawn...of that I am certain.${prompt}
  7930: |-
    I never thought to walk this land again, not even in death.
    Is this what they call karma...?${prompt}
  7931: |-
    This land has borne the weight of my sins.
    I will not beg for forgiveness, but accept my responsibility...${prompt}
  7932: |-
    So this is the reason for that unspeakable terror I feltaru here when I was still alive. It's possible that the other realm has existed for much longer than anyone ever dreamed...
    Keep your wits aboutaru you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7933: |-
    I'm not rrreally fond of touching platitudes.
    Snap Raogrimm to his senses with a big ol' smack to the head for me.${prompt}
  7934: |-
    It is time!
    Put an end to this thirty-year nightmare, ${name-player}.
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! Show us the path to Xarcabard!
  7935: Death does not exist in that realm. You might call it a “prison of souls.”${prompt}
  7936: |-
    Even those who fall in battle will rise again after a time as if nothing had happened.
    Like a flame returning to a candle whose light has been extinguished...${prompt}
  7937: It is an endless succession of life and death. How many times has that cycle repeated itself in that damned abode?${prompt}
  7938: There is one thing that bothers me. Whatever happened to the original wielders of the weapons and armor that the beastmen there now possess? If the statues in the shape of Orcs and such were once actual beastmen, then...? But I get carried away with my musings.${prompt}
  7939: |-
    Please pay no mind to my ramblings.
    You have secured the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. An incredible feat. It proves the strength of your conviction, and is one of the keys you will need to enter Xarcabard.${prompt}
  7940: |-
    You will need four such trophies.
    Once you have them within your grasp, make your way to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. Cornelia awaits you there.${prompt}
  7941: I don't know about the other four, but I can't hear his voice anymore...${prompt}
  7942: Is this another brand I must bear for my treachery? I must truly be hated if that's the case.${prompt}
  7943: |-
    It is something I would wish for at the moment, however. I pray this silence is just a continuation of our incompatible personalities.
    If not, then it means his pronouncement has become reality...${prompt}
  7944: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    This is more than just a testament to your strength. It is one of the keys that will lead you to Xarcabard, along with the trophies of the other realms.${prompt}
  7945: |-
    When you have all four trophies, travel to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. You will find Cornelia waiting for you there.
    That is all the wisdom I have left to give you.${prompt}
  7946: |-
    What is the true nature of that other world? I can only explain it as a place that lies beyond the limitarus of our knowledge.
    But I'm sure I've feltaru that aura somewhere before...${prompt}
  7947: That's it. That protocrystal I came across when I was doing research in Elshimo. The magical emanations coming from the crystal gave me a similar impression. An avatar? No, that can'taru be...${prompt}
  7948: |-
    Oh! Oh, I'm terribly-werribly sorry!
    I appear to have driftarued into my old habits.${prompt}
  7949: |-
    Now, ${name-player}.
    This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is both a symbol of your fortitude, and one of the keys that will help you gain access to Xarcabard. The trophies from the other three realms carry the same importance.${prompt}
  7950: Gather all four trophies and hurry yourself on to Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia will be waiting for you when you get there. But be wary, ${name-player}. The blackness enveloping that world grows ever deeper, ever darker...${prompt}
  7951: The beastmen of that world carry the spoils of prrrevious battles. Equipment that you or I would use.${prompt}
  7952: I'm not able to touch them in my prrresent form, but I feel something about those weapons and armor...something extrrraordinary.${prompt}
  7953: |-
    Wait, wait, wait!
    I don't mean that they're currrsed or anything like that! It's something more like, um, not ominous, but...
    How can I explain it?${prompt}
  7954: Anyway! They're not evil, just...you know? Different from other normal swords and things. Being all ghostlike and stuff, you can feel things like that.${prompt}
  7955: |-
    But enough of that kinda talk--congrrratulations are in order!
    You've got your paws on the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! It shows you've got the goods in the hero department, and it will also help you get into Xarcabard.${prompt}
  7956: But first you've got to collect the other three trophies and then hightail it to snowy Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia should be up there waiting for you.${prompt}
  7957: "${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and the four trophies.\nThese artifacts have long been lost to that other world. \nThe Hydra Corps was a unit formed after our expedition to the Northlands.${prompt}"
  7958: |-
    It must have been in the time of the Great War...
    Nobody knows how the Hydra artifacts came to be there, but those five trophies will open the path for you.${prompt}
  7959: Each of these items holds a measure of power. However, the strength of a single artifact is limited.${prompt}
  7960: |-
    The ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} and the ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.
    Combining these separate entities created a bridge from Vana'diel to the other realms.
    Xarcabard, I'm afraid, is another matter entirely...${prompt}
  7961: |-
    Unless the shroud of darkness is lifted, that power alone will not be enough to open the way.
    However, the five trophies resonate with another artifact that lies within his land. If we can join our strength to theirs...${prompt}
  7962: Let us make haste to the land where this all began. To Xarcabard...${prompt}
  7963: Is it over...?${prompt}
  7964: No, the rage has merely been dispersed.${prompt}
  7965: As long as I exist, he will never truly die...${prompt}
  7966: Or perhaps an eternal soul is something beyond the concept of death?${prompt}
  7967: |-
    ${name-player}...
    You have achieved an incredible feat--the unification of the Shadow Lord has been prevented.
    I have not the words to express my gratitude.${prompt}
  7968: |-
    The power of the crystal has faded, but I will be drawn into that towering rage no more.
    I have heard the voice of the one who holds sway over this realm...${prompt}
  7969: The one who holds sway...?${prompt}
  7970: |-
    Yes. From the center of infinite darkness.
    I was in a place beyond comprehension when those words reached into my mind...${prompt}
  7971: |-
    You who have touched the crystal, the one who holds immortal power within a mortal shell.
    The rage that has arisen from your twisted core will devour my world.${prompt}
  7972: |-
    It was an error in judgment to shelter you...
    The order of my realm has been disrupted.${prompt}
  7973: |-
    I give to you a duty...
    You will stand vigil until an age without hatred has dawned.${prompt}
  7974: |-
    No matter what terrible power you might wield, there is no escape from Dynamis for an incomplete soul.
    No return to the land of blessed light...${prompt}
  7975: |-
    What manner of being was this who spoke from a pit of blackness?
    As this question gnawed at my mind, the voice grew quiet, leaving me in unanswered silence.${prompt}
  7976: |-
    Of one thing I was certain.
    This voice belonged to the ruler of Dynamis.${prompt}
  7977: A flow of energy exists in Vana'diel that has escaped the notice of those who dwell there.${prompt}
  7978: |-
    Thirty years past, my contact with the crystal caused an accelerated change in this flow.
    It was as if it had leapt forward, rushing along a deliberate course.${prompt}
  7979: |-
    Nobody knows what lies at the end of this journey.
    Perhaps it will reveal the true nature of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7980: ${name-player}, you may be the one to witness this truth.${prompt}
  7981: |-
    The power stored in the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will soon be drained.
    And I must remain in this world in my role of observer.${prompt}
  7982: |-
    Do not forget who you are, ${name-player}.
    I bid farewell to a most heroic adventurer.${prompt}
  7983: My old companions...?
  7984: |-
    This duty is too much for just one to bear.
    If you will have me, I will stand at your side until an age without hatred has arrived.
    It pains me to see the depths to which my country has fallen.${prompt}
  7985: That is my only reason for staying. Do not misunderstand my motivations.${prompt}
  7986: |-
    Blessed light and the ruler of Dynamis?
    I do believe you've rekindled my long-forgotten sense of adventure.${prompt}
  7987: |-
    Once I've gotten all firedy-up, even you can'taru keep me back, Raogrimm.
    I'm sure my incomparable research skills will be of use in your task.${prompt}
  7988: |-
    C'mon, let's see a little excitement!
    This is our expedition's thirty-year rrreunion.${prompt}
  7989: |-
    It's not the Northlands this time.
    None of us are going to grow old and die, so who else would you want with you on a task as long as this one?${prompt}
  7990: |-
    I'm not gonna back down, no matterrr how much you complain.
    Better just give in and accept the fact that you're stuck with me.${prompt}
  7991: |-
    I thought this would be the end of you for sure...
    Hmph. You're just as thick-skinned as you used to be.${prompt}
  7992: |-
    What, no words for an old friend?
    Thinking about testing your theory on whether or not a soul can be killed?${prompt}
  7993: |-
    I betrayed you!
    I extinguished the light of your precious Cornelia!
    The man responsible for this entire nightmare stands right before you!${prompt}
  7994: |-
    Everything began thirty years ago.
    And there were things that came to an end...
    Even though I was a prisoner of uncontrollable rage, the fact remains that I took the lives of my companions with my own hands.${prompt}
  7995: And yet, my old companions, you are the ones who have saved me from falling into that pit of hatred a second time.${prompt}
  7996: |-
    I have words of gratitude, but do not stand in a position to blame anyone for their actions.
    No matter who that person may be.${prompt}
  7997: Raogrimm...${prompt}
  7998: |-
    Are you sure you want to do this?
    This duty will continue until hatred has faded from the land.
    As long as my divided soul remains, there may never be an end to that rage...${prompt}
  7999: |-
    Raogrimm.
    There is no need to suffer alone anymore.
    Our presence here should answer your question.${prompt}
  8000: |-
    There are crimes that must be atoned for.
    And if that means staying on after death and watching over this world, then we who were your companions will share the burden along with you.${prompt}
  8001: |-
    Until the dawn of an age without hatred...
    No, as long as this world continues to be, I will remain by your side.${prompt}

  8227: Well, I have no more use for this weapon, so I guess you can have it. But there is one thing I want you to remember.${prompt}
  8228: This gun is a fearsome weapon that unleashes a blast upon your enemies many thousands of times greater in strength than the tiny effort it takes you to pull the trigger. Needless to say, be careful who you aim it at...${prompt}
  8229: '...${prompt}'
  8230: A weapon has no will of its own. But it was made for a purpose.${prompt}

  11820: |-
    What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo!
    Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!${prompt}
  11821: |-
    We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers.

    Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo.
    Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom.
    It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!${prompt}
  11824: The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!${prompt}
  11825: |-
    In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign.
    Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.${prompt}
  11826: Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...${prompt}
  11827: |-
    King Kupofried was greatly dismayed.
    How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?${prompt}
  11828: In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.${prompt}
  11829: “Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo,” he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.${prompt}
  11830: |-
    Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin.
    A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?${prompt}
  11831: |-
    We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition.
    We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!${prompt}

  11962: The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called “Voidwalkers.” Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt}
  11963: |-
    Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.
    This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt}
  11964: Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt}
  11965: A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt}
  11966: Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt}
  11967: |-
    Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.
    Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt}
  11968: Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt}
  11969: Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt}
  11970: However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt}
  11971: |-
    When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.
    These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt}
  11972: Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt}
  11973: The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt}
  11974: |-
    Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.
    Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt}
  11975: As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt}
  11976: Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt}
  11977: Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt}
  11978: After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt}
  11979: Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt}
  11980: Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  11981: While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  11982: Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt}
  11983: Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt}
  11984: Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt}
  11985: Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt}
  11986: Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt}
  11987: The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt}
  11988: The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt}
  11989: Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt}
  11990: 'Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt}'

    By infusing atmacite to one's body using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.${prompt}
  11992: Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}
  11993: Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.${prompt}
  11994: Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.${prompt}
  11995: As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.${prompt}
  11996: Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.${prompt}
  11997: 'Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level ${number: 0}.${prompt}'
