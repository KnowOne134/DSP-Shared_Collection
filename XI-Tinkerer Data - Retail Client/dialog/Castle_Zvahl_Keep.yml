  7397: '　　 ${wait-animation: 1}'
  7398: |-
    It's completely different in here than it is out there!
    What's going on!?${prompt}
  7399: It must be due to opening the gate to the underworld.
  7400: This area has been interspersed with Valhalla, and it's throwing everything off.
  7401: |-
    Th-this place is really cold.
    It seeps into your v-very soul...${prompt}
  7402: Well, Valhalla is where people go when they die!${prompt}
  7403: So maybe since Valhalla has partially merged with this world, it means we're also half dead?${prompt}
  7404: |-
    Most impressive, Destiny Destroyers.
    That's not a bad guess, actually...
  7405: In fact, I'd venture to say you're half right.
  7406: This is a world where both the living and the dead coexist.
  7407: |-
    You!
    You're the Maelstrom Mage, Garazu-Horeizu!
  7408: |-
    It is a pleasure to meet you.
    I am pleased to hear that my name is known throughout the world of beastmen as well.${prompt}
  7409: I have heard your names from our loyal legion of the dead.${prompt}
  7410: I figured that explosion would allow us to meet in Valhalla...${prompt}
  7411: But as you can see, you lot are not nearly strong enough to be summoned to such a hallowed place.${prompt}
  7412: As such, we are fortunate that we were able to meet here.${prompt}
  7413: Silence! You'll pay for what you've done!
  7414: I'm more interested in this one here.${prompt}
  7415: Although expected, it was still a little surprising to see humanoids joining forces with beastmen.${prompt}
  7416: It is clear that things have changed since the time I walked the land.${prompt}
  7417: |-
    Several decades ago, there was a great war between humans and beastmen.
    Does that no longer concern you?${prompt}
  7418: You may be a Galka, but it appears that you are not the Talekeeper...${prompt}
  7419: |-
    Let me guess...
    You are what is known as an adventurer.${prompt}
  7420: You dare to visit uncharted lands that others are afraid to set foot in.${prompt}
  7421: So you were willing to go to any means necessary to obtain that weapon in your hand, yes?${prompt}
  7422: |-
    Did you want to obtain the weapon?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, that's right.
    No, not really.${prompt}
  7423: |-
    I see...
    I believe you, for I tend not to deny that which is posited before me.${prompt}
  7424: If I did, then I would never be able to reach a higher plane of knowledge.${prompt}
  7425: |-
    I believe you and I are the same.
    That is why you were able to make it this far.${prompt}
  7426: However, I think you are forgetting something important.
  7427: That which dwells within the weapon you wield shall devour your very soul.${prompt}
  7428: |-
    Do you realize what that means?
    Have you ever thought about what a soul actually is?${prompt}
  7429: Normally, you only regard injuries inflicted upon that which can be seen by the naked eye.${prompt}
  7430: |-
    Gloom Phantom...
    As a Goblin, surely you can answer this.${prompt}
  7431: Huh!?
  7432: |-
    Um...
    The old man told me that it leads to a shortening of one's life span!${prompt}
  7433: During the battle five thousand years ago, those with such weapons weren't just killed by Chaos and its minions.
  7434: I heard that many of them died after a small piece of their souls was eaten with every swing of their weapon.
  7435: Then, the next-strongest individual would take up the sword from that corpse, and so on and so forth.
  7436: The battle in Valhalla would continue to be fought until only one was left standing.
  7437: |-
    Life span...
    Once again, you are only half right.${prompt}
  7438: The soul is a collection of the “potential” that you possess.${prompt}
  7439: As an adventurer, perhaps it is easier to understand it as “free will.”${prompt}
  7440: The usual variety of “choices” that lie before you are slowly eaten away.${prompt}
  7441: You gradually lose the freedom to choose, and in the end, only death awaits.${prompt}
  7442: Therefore, I believe that there is no more idiotic choice one can make than to wield such a weapon.${prompt}
  7443: I have no idea what you're talking about.${prompt}
  7444: I-I think he's saying we should get rid of the w-weapon...${prompt}
  7445: |-
    What!?
    I refuse to let that happen!${prompt}
  7446: |-
    You can refuse all you like, but it matters not.
    You are a beastman, while ${choice: 7}[she/he] is a humanoid.${prompt}
  7447: Furthermore, the only reason I can see that you are working together is because your interests align, for the moment at least.${prompt}
  7448: In fact, the relationship between you is entirely due to the weapon.${prompt}
  7449: |-
    If it were to be lost, then you would become enemies.
    Or at the very least, you would return to your usual state of indifference.${prompt}
  7450: Despite all that babbling, you're also only half right!${prompt}
  7451: The only reason that ${name-player} and I are connected is because of the weapon!${prompt}
  7452: However, that connection is much more powerful than you give it credit for!${prompt}
  7453: That weapon has been passed between the corpses of heroes from various races ever since that fateful battle five thousand years ago...${prompt}
  7454: Orcs, Quadav, Yagudo, Sahagin, apkallu, pteraketos, Meebles, citrullus, Goblins...${prompt}
  7455: And when I was the last one to take up that sword...${prompt}
  7456: I also became something of a corpse when it was smashed to pieces.${prompt}
  7457: And just like before, someone has arrived to take up the weapon in my stead...${prompt}
  7458: And that person is none other than ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7459: |-
    There is five thousand years of history connecting us all.
    That is why I refuse to let it be cast aside!${prompt}
  7460: |-
    Throw away the weapon?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  7461: |-
    Huh!? If you think it's that easy, go ahead and try!
    Someone will be there to pick it up!${prompt}
  7462: |-
    I realize it is hard for you to understand.
    But even that choice will be taken from you.${prompt}
  7463: Hah! You're the one who doesn't understand!${prompt}
  7464: We simply need to beat you before our soul can be devoured!${prompt}
  7465: |-
    Yes, he who strikes first, strikes last.
    How very appropriate of a beastman.${prompt}
  7466: I shall learn from your words and simply deny you any chance at victory from the beginning...${prompt}
  7467: Deny you the choice of life itself, even...
  7468: Look over there!
  7469: |-
    Rrrrrr!
    Is that Chaos!?${prompt}
  7470: It looks like things are starting to heat up!${prompt}
  7471: |-
    Ch-Chaos or the Maelstrom Mage...
    Which should we attack first!?${prompt}
  7472: There is no need for Chaos to join this fight.${prompt}
  7473: Rejoice! Both your body and soul shall serve as nourishment for Chaos's divine ambition.
  7474: What just happened!?${prompt}
  7475: I thought only that weapon could finish off Chaos!?${prompt}
  7476: Did we win!?${prompt}
  7477: Hah! That Chaos isn't so tough after all!${prompt}
  7478: Huh!?
  7479: |-
    Well done.
    Now, shall we try again?${prompt}
  7480: |-
    Wha!?
    Is that Chaos again!?${prompt}
  7481: |-
    L-look closer...
    That's not the r-real thing!${prompt}
  7482: |-
    This is special magic that I've encountered before.
    It is illusion magic that was used by a pair of sibling mages.${prompt}
  7483: Although it depends on the illusion, it consumes large amounts of magical energy, and normally cannot be cast multiple times.${prompt}
  7484: However, I am currently linked to Chaos itself.${prompt}
  7485: Chaos possesses the power to connect with the astral plane...${prompt}
  7486: As a result, I am able to tap into the pure magical energies found there.${prompt}
  7487: Naturally, the high purity of this energy means that only skilled mages like myself can harness it.${prompt}
  7488: H-he's able to continually use his m-magic without interruption...${prompt}
  7489: So in other words, we're basically doomed, yes?${prompt}
  7490: |-
    Curses...
    Skokkr never told me anything about this!${prompt}
  7491: Since Odin has closed the gates to the underworld, I imagine the denizens of Vana'diel are likely ignorant of a great many things.${prompt}
  7492: |-
    Now then...
    Shall we resume the battle?${prompt}
  7493: It will be a worthwhile experiment to see just how many rounds you can survive.${prompt}
  7494: Hey, time out!
  7495: |-
    You have no chance at victory here...
    You must flee!${prompt}
  7496: Hey! Is that the Shadow Lord!?
  7497: '!!!'
  7498: W-wait, isn't that...!?
  7499: '...I may be able to slow them down.${prompt}'
  7500: It's you...
  7501: |-
    I am not who you think...
    There is no going back for me now.${prompt}
  7502: |-
    My prior death and subsequent resurrection...
    I do not lament my lot in life.${prompt}
  7503: |-
    I shall leave the rest to you...
    Now go!${prompt}
  7504: |-
    This way!
    Hurry!
  7505: Thanks, Shadow Lord!
  7506: |-
    I can see where this is going...
    However, I cannot avoid it.
  7507: Phew... Phew...
  7508: Do you think we're safe here?${prompt}
  7509: |-
    I never expected that we'd be saved by the Shadow Lord.
    Talk about a shocking development!${prompt}
  7510: Still, I thought the Shadow Lord was slain by a human.${prompt}
  7511: Maybe he came from Valhalla?${prompt}
  7512: A-at any rate, I received this.${prompt}
  7513: I-it definitely belongs to a h-human...${prompt}
  7514: |-
    Forget about that for now.
    We've got to tell the demon about this new development!${prompt}
  7515: We're heading to the road that leads to the Beaucedine Glacier in order to meet with Duke Alloces!${prompt}
  7516: Come join us there as soon as you can!${prompt}
  7517: You must meet with Duke Alloces near the Beaucedine Glacier in Xarcabard.${prompt}
  7518: Hey! What took you so long!?${prompt}
  7519: The demon's seal just started glowing!${prompt}
  7520: |-
    Th-that's the order for all units to ch-charge!
    L-let's get going!${prompt}
  7521: |-
    Join the battle?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    Not yet.${prompt}
  7522: What!? Did you forget something!?${prompt}
  7523: Okay! Everyone make way for ${name-player} and the Destiny Destroyers!${prompt}
  7524: Chaaaaaarge!
  7525: Huh?
  7526: Wh-what is this p-place?${prompt}
  7527: There! Is that the underworld!?${prompt}
  7528: |-
    Now's our chance!
    Use your weapon to break the gate's seal!${prompt}
  7529: Sorry, but I am afraid I cannot allow that to happen.${prompt}
  7530: I can see your limited intelligence means I have to repeat myself yet again.${prompt}
  7531: At the moment, I am linked to Chaos, who has the power to connect to the astral plane.${prompt}
  7532: |-
    This connection allows me to use magic without interruption...
    That means I am essentially invincible.${prompt}
  7533: Therefore, that seal will remain for as long as I will it so.${prompt}
  7534: We already know that, you fool!${prompt}
  7535: |-
    You really are full of yourself!
    I've come here to give you a good pummeling!${prompt}
  7536: No, you are the fools for wasting the Shadow Lord's sacrifice.${prompt}
  7537: However, I must say that your “choice” is somewhat unexpected.${prompt}
  7538: As the wielder of that weapon, I figured that you would be the one to lead the beastmen into battle.${prompt}
  7539: |-
    However, you were the last to arrive.
    That can only mean...${prompt}
  7540: |-
    You acted intelligently in order to deal with any unexpected circumstances.
    Or perhaps you wished to spread out your army's strength...${prompt}
  7541: Actually, we were just wasting time due to indecision...
  7542: |-
    Enough already!
    More importantly, where is everyone!?${prompt}
  7543: I-it seems that the Chaos illusions aren't h-here...${prompt}
  7544: If you're talking about your beastmen friends, they're already in battle with Chaos.
  7545: Chaos is determined to devour the unsightly creatures that have overrun this world.
  7546: Ungh! You mean the battle has already started!?
  7547: It is but a trifle to send you lot to that battlefield as well.${prompt}
  7548: However, I wondered if there was some particular meaning to our encounter.${prompt}
  7549: |-
    You see, it's a bad habit of mine.
    I always try to find the deeper meaning of things.${prompt}
  7550: |-
    Of course there's a deeper meaning!
    You're destined to fall by our hand!${prompt}
  7551: No, that is not it.${prompt}
  7552: For example, you and I are of the same race.${prompt}
  7553: |-
    Have you noticed?
    Those like us are actually outsiders in the war against Chaos.${prompt}
  7554: Huh? What do you mean?${prompt}
  7555: Have you ever wondered why I am not in any danger from Chaos?${prompt}
  7556: The truth is, Chaos does not consume those that are like me.${prompt}
  7557: Wh-wha!?
  7558: Y-you're lying!
  7559: Wh-what this mean!?
  7560: I heard about the story from Chaos.${prompt}
  7561: Chaos was originally a dragon that resided in a world known as “Paradise.”
  7562: The world was a beautiful and peaceful place, populated by a race known as the Zilart.
  7563: One day, however, a terrible incident occurred, which led to the world's destruction...
  7564: The sense of order within the world was forever altered, and it was apparently reborn as a new world known as Vana'diel.
  7565: One of the last surviving dragons felt that this transformation was the world being poisoned.${prompt}
  7566: Therefore, in an effort to purify the world and restore it to its former status, it began consuming that which did not originate from Paradise.${prompt}
  7567: At first, it began consuming the crystals that covered the planet, which led to its metamorphosis into a terrestrial avatar...${prompt}
  7568: It also continued to devour any newly born races that happened to appear before it.${prompt}
  7569: However, it was not able to contain the concept of “evolution” that pervaded Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7570: The place became overrun with hideous beings such as yourselves.${prompt}
  7571: Have your rather dim wits managed to keep up so far?${prompt}
  7572: As such, there is no reason to destroy those like myself, because we descend directly from the Zilart.${prompt}
  7573: I-is this all true?${prompt}
  7574: |-
    I-I've never heard of it...
    Could this all be a l-lie?${prompt}
  7575: Maybe it's all a plan to seize the weapon for their side...${prompt}
  7576: |-
    No, not at all.
    For when we last spoke, you had already made your “choice.”${prompt}
  7577: |-
    You chose to not discard the weapon.
    In other words, you chose to oppose me.${prompt}
  7578: |-
    However, we are one and the same.
    That is why I am telling you the truth now.${prompt}
  7579: Furthermore, I have a question to ask of you.${prompt}
  7580: How would you like to acquire Chaos's power as your own and attain absolute perfection?${prompt}
  7581: Absolute perfection?${prompt}
  7582: I do not mean to say that we will become the Zilart people that Chaos so desires.${prompt}
  7583: No, I mean that we shall become terrestrial avatars like Chaos itself.${prompt}
  7584: A-a terrestrial avatar?
  7585: You mean those things that eat all the crystals!?${prompt}
  7586: |-
    That is correct.
    I see you were paying attention to the story of how Chaos became a terrestrial avatar and began devouring crystals.${prompt}
  7587: However, we would not utilize the same method as Chaos.${prompt}
  7588: We can absorb the power needed for the transformation from the crystals in the astral plane through Chaos and then convert it into our flesh and blood.${prompt}
  7589: Well? Have I piqued your interest yet?${prompt}
  7590: |-
    Are you serious?
    Is such a thing really possible?${prompt}
  7591: I have refined my theory over many years of research.${prompt}
  7592: There exists a theory known as the “spiral theory.”${prompt}
  7593: I have studied numerous souls within Valhalla, and it became clear that the difference between success and failure simply came down to the size of the soul's vessel.${prompt}
  7594: |-
    That just left the need to make improvements to the body and soul.
    Of course, the process required a large quantity of souls...${prompt}
  7595: |-
    The souls residing within Valhalla were simply not enough.
    Therefore, I decided to utilize the souls of the people of Vana'diel as well.${prompt}
  7596: That is why I must return to Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7597: Wait, this all sounds kinda dangerous.${prompt}
  7598: Silence! This matter does not concern you beastmen.${prompt}
  7599: If you desire to abandon your current mortal coil and become a terrestrial avatar, aid me in my resurrection.${prompt}
  7600: |-
    Will you offer your aid?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No way.${prompt}
  7601: Hey, what're you doing!?
  7602: Th-there's no way you can hope to become a t-terrestrial avatar!
  7603: You do realize that if you go along with this, you'll just be devoured by Chaos, right?
  7604: |-
    You refuse my offer?
    That is your “choice”?${prompt}
  7605: |-
    I anticipated as much.
    It is clear that we value very different things.${prompt}
  7606: |-
    That should've been obvious!
    ${name-player} is a brave hero beyond reproach!${prompt}
  7607: However, you are an enemy to beastmen, people, the living and dead, and Vana'diel itself!${prompt}
  7608: You could not be more wrong.
  7609: The true enemy of the world is one who denies the existence of new possibilities and clings to the foolish choices of the past.
  7610: Hehe... I did not expect that our confrontation would take such a turn.${prompt}
  7611: |-
    I suppose the world is filled with exceptions.
    You may consider this to be my response.${prompt}
  7612: It is the answer of the world itself...${prompt}
  7613: See the results of the choice you have made.${prompt}
  7614: However, know that Chaos has made a different choice.${prompt}
  7615: H-huh!?${prompt}
  7616: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}...
    I see you are all right.${prompt}
  7617: Our entire army has been annihilated.${prompt}
  7618: A-annihilated!?
  7619: Chaos... Chaos was...
  7620: "It was no illusion; it was the real thing.\0.!${prompt}"
  7621: Wh-wh-what do you mean!?${prompt}
  7622: |-
    Hehehe...
    You see, Chaos has already arrived.${prompt}
  7623: What!? W-we're doomed...${prompt}
  7624: Wait, there's no way we can beat Chaos without the weapon!${prompt}
  7625: |-
    It is no use...
    If only we had realized what was happening sooner...${prompt}
  7626: |-
    Hehehe...
    Do you think you will make the same choice when face-to-face with Chaos?${prompt}
  7627: Now, I call upon the very power of my soul...${prompt}
  7628: Come hither!${prompt}
  7629: The traitor...!
  7630: I shall admit my defeat and return to Valhalla to recover from my wounds.
  7631: Huh!? He's running away!?${prompt}
  7632: I shall let Chaos decide whether you are to live or die!${prompt}
  7633: Garazu-Horeizu!
  7634: Medada... Gurebu-Ogurebu!?
  7635: That's not possible...!
  7636: Ultima!
  7637: Aaaaaargh!
  7638: Wh-why...
  7639: Please, I...
  7640: What you have done is unforgivable.${prompt}
  7641: You and your soul shall vanish into nothingness.${prompt}
  7642: We did it! We actually did it!${prompt}
  7643: Who are you!?${prompt}
  7644: They are from the time when the traitor lived in Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7645: |-
    They are the two mages that bested him then.
    We could not have asked for better reinforcements.${prompt}
  7646: |-
    Duke Alloces!
    Odin asked us to deliver a message!${prompt}
  7647: What is it!?${prompt}
  7648: “You must defend the gate to the underworld.”${prompt}
  7649: If the gate is opened, then Odin's power can join him in Valhalla.${prompt}
  7650: Odin will need that power in order to defeat Chaos.${prompt}
  7651: Chaos...the one true Chaos...is heading this way.${prompt}
  7652: '!?'
  7653: Even though there have been sightings east of Mount Helgafjell in Valhalla?${prompt}
  7654: Hmph... Couldn't that just be one of Chaos's illusions?${prompt}
  7655: If that is true, then we must buy Odin time until his power can be restored!${prompt}
  7656: |-
    Leave it to us!
    We've got the hero with the legendary weapon on our side!${prompt}
  7657: So you are the new wielder of the legendary weapon!${prompt}
  7658: |-
    Take care! This Chaos is the equal of the one from five thousand years ago!
    In fact, it is safe to say that they are one and the same!${prompt}
  7659: You mean 'cause they look same?${prompt}
  7660: I-it's not the same as the beast that h-hatched from the egg?${prompt}
  7661: Five thousand years ago, Chaos was defeated by the beastman army in Vana'diel, but that was not the end of it...
  7662: It arrived at a world steeped in “stagnation” and began devouring the souls that were trapped there.
  7663: This land of “stagnation” is what served as the basis for the current Valhalla.
  7664: It is said that Odin was drawn to that world, and it took all the power he could muster to defeat Chaos.
  7665: However, he was not able to put an end to Chaos as everyone had hoped...${prompt}
  7666: Seriously!?${prompt}
  7667: Well, it is actually something that we just learned ourselves the other day.${prompt}
  7668: For although Chaos vanished following Odin's mightiest blow, a giant egg appeared in its place.${prompt}
  7669: At the time, Odin had yet to gift the power contained within his left eye to the Galka.${prompt}
  7670: |-
    Despite that, he was unable to destroy the egg for the next five thousand years.
    No matter what he tried, he was unable to make even the slightest crack.${prompt}
  7671: It was because Chaos drew upon the power from the crystals in the “astral plane” where the gods themselves slumbered.${prompt}
  7672: Even if the egg were to be damaged, the power of the crystals immediately restored it.${prompt}
  7673: S-so that egg survived for five thousand years?${prompt}
  7674: Eventually, Garazu-Horeizu was able to hatch it!${prompt}
  7675: Yes, although Chaos is the source of it all.${prompt}
  7676: We must help Odin regain his power so that he can defeat Chaos...${prompt}
  7677: Look! That must be due to his power...
  7678: Uwaaah!
  7679: Urk! I-is that Chaos!?${prompt}
  7680: Ungh! I can feel its presence within my very being!
  7681: So Garazu-Horeizu has fallen...${prompt}
  7682: The Zilart, the one true beings, are powerful and glorious divine entities blessed with eternal life.${prompt}
  7683: Those living in the present believed they were descendants of the Zilart...${prompt}
  7684: However, they are but mere pretenders.${prompt}
  7685: Ten thousand years have passed since the end of the one true world, meaning that such pretenders are all that remain.${prompt}
  7686: |-
    This is unbearable!
    Vana'diel is a world filled with naught but weak, transient, and grotesque beings!${prompt}
  7687: I find the mere existence of the weak to be repulsive.${prompt}
  7688: Although you may not become a god, you can become part of a god--part of me.${prompt}
  7689: Ungh... What just happened?${prompt}
  7690: B-but... That was his own ally...${prompt}
  7691: Is that a World Eater weapon you possess?${prompt}
  7692: That must mean that you are a descendant of the Zilart...${prompt}
  7693: |-
    Are you a descendant of the Zilart?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I am.
    No, sorry.
    I'm a descendant of Promathia.${prompt}
  7694: So you are the same as Garazu-Horeizu.${prompt}
  7695: If you are like him, then you too should simply accept your destiny.${prompt}
  7696: You should be a powerful and glorious divine being.${prompt}
  7697: You have the choice of whether to equal or perhaps even exceed my power!${prompt}
  7698: I see... Then your fate is to be devoured.${prompt}
  7699: If you were one of the chosen ones, then I would have accepted you as a powerful and glorious divine being.${prompt}
  7700: Honestly, I have no idea what you're babbling about!${prompt}
  7701: |-
    ${name-player} is ${name-player}!
    ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] is one of us!${prompt}
  7702: A wonderful individual born and raised in Vana'diel!${prompt}
  7703: Promathia... I know that name from somewhere...${prompt}
  7704: |-
    The whispers of the gods, descended from the astral plane...
    Their voices echo from up high...${prompt}
  7705: Could it be... Are you a descendant of the gods?${prompt}
  7706: Is the reason for the chosen people's divinity because they are descended from the gods themselves?${prompt}
  7707: If what you say is true, then you should possess a power greater than any terrestrial avatar.${prompt}
  7708: If so, you should take a cue from Garazu-Horeizu and accept your destiny.${prompt}
  7709: Make your choice!${prompt}
  7710: Look out!
  7711: Urk... That single blow took all of their lives...${prompt}
  7712: That is the strength of a terrestrial avatar such as Chaos, who can freely wield the power of the crystals.${prompt}
  7713: That technique absorbs the life force of living beings...${prompt}
  7714: |-
    If we can protect...${name-player}...and the weapon...
    We may have a chance at victory...${prompt}
  7715: |-
    Understood!
    We'll do our best to keep them safe!${prompt}
  7716: We are counting on you, ${name-player}...${prompt}
  7717: 'Come back again after you have performed the first upgrade for the weapon (excluding ${item-singular: 1[2]} and ${item-singular: 2[2]}).${prompt}'
  7718: |-
    Shining bright in divinity...
    The one true being...${prompt}
  7719: Yet, why do you insist on living among these hideous creatures...${prompt}
  7720: I shall await the answer following another five thousand years of slumber...${prompt}
  7721: At last...${prompt}
  7722: This must be the blood of Chaos...${prompt}
  7723: What is this? The wounds are healing...${prompt}
  7724: |-
    Ah yes, of course!
    Chaos's power is the power of the crystals--the power of life itself!${prompt}
  7725: Huh?
  7726: H-huh!?
  7727: Hm?
  7728: This black mist is Chaos's blood...${prompt}
  7729: The power of the crystals is filled with the power of life itself!${prompt}
  7730: |-
    It's just as the legends foretold...
    The weapon has regained its power!${prompt}
  7731: Now ${name-player} and I can finally put an end to Chaos!${prompt}
  7732: |-
    Chaos! Where are you, you coward!?
    Come and get some of us!${prompt}
  7733: Look! Chaos's body...has transformed into an egg!${prompt}
  7734: Wha!? Its body...?${prompt}
  7735: D-did this happen after you defeated Chaos?${prompt}
  7736: Oh no! Have we been played all along!?
  7737: Wait! Look! The egg, it's...${prompt}
  7738: Is that a World Eater Egg!?${prompt}
  7739: |-
    That is correct.
    Chaos has returned to its accursed egg form...${prompt}
  7740: D-does that mean...this will all repeat itself in another f-five thousand years...?${prompt}
  7741: The egg seems to be drawing from the power of the crystals...
  7742: |-
    Hmm...
    Perhaps it intends to recover from its wounds and hatch again in five thousand years...${prompt}
  7743: There's no way I'm gonna let that happen!${prompt}
  7744: Everyone, follow me!
  7745: |-
    Huh!?
    Not even the legendary weapon itself can crack it!?${prompt}
  7746: That egg is different from the ones that came before it...${prompt}
  7747: It is not a World Eater Egg that was laid by Chaos.${prompt}
  7748: This egg serves as a sort of shell and armor for Chaos, forming a virtually indestructible fortress.${prompt}
  7749: |-
    As such, you cannot destroy it.
    Not even Odin himself was able to do so five thousand years ago!${prompt}
  7750: So what are we supposed to do!?${prompt}
  7751: What about ${name-player}!?${prompt}
  7752: |-
    Try to destroy the World Eater Egg?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure.
    I'd better not.${prompt}
  7753: I am afraid there is nothing you can do either.${prompt}
  7754: Naturally, ${name-player} is unable to damage it either.${prompt}
  7755: I apologize for keeping thee waiting, o brave hero who defeated Chaos.${prompt}
  7756: Lord Odin!
  7757: |-
    Firstly, I must offer thee the highest praise.
    Though there hath been many sacrifices, this victory was absolutely essential!${prompt}
  7758: However, this egg doth...${prompt}
  7759: '...I wonder if it shan''t simply repeat the same cycle of woe following Chaos''s end five thousand years ago...${prompt}'
  7760: At the time, mine only choice was to place a seal on Chaos's egg.${prompt}
  7761: |-
    I dug a pit in the mountain of Helgafjell in Valhalla and buried it in darkness.
    Wouldst it were that simple...${prompt}
  7762: Even such efforts were not enough to destroy it...${prompt}
  7763: So not even a god like Odin himself is powerful enough to destroy this egg?${prompt}
  7764: |-
    Lord Odin!
    If you could restore the power of your left eye, then perhaps you could destroy the egg!?${prompt}
  7765: |-
    I refuse to abandon hope.
    Mayhap this time things shall follow a different path...${prompt}
  7766: |-
    Very well. The time hath come!
    I summon thee to this place!
  7767: |-
    My left eye, which I entrusted to the Galka...
    In accordance with the ancient vow, I shall receive its divine power.${prompt}
  7768: Along with the recollections of the Talekeeper that reside within the eye...
  7769: Our chance hath arrived!
  7770: My knight, thine efforts in Vana'diel were most admirable.${prompt}
  7771: Within the weapon lieth a power befitting your unwavering soul and passion.${prompt}
  7772: ${name-player}, thine efforts in Vana'diel were most admirable.${prompt}
  7773: Within your weapon lieth a power befitting your mighty soul and unwavering passion.${prompt}
  7774: As for thee, Gloom Phantom...${prompt}
  7775: Huh!? Me!?${prompt}
  7776: Somehow, thou art also capable of wielding the weapon.${prompt}
  7777: |-
    The sword... He restored it!
    It must be due to Chaos's blood!${prompt}
  7778: Knowest that the power needed to fulfill thy duty resides within thy weapon.${prompt}
  7779: Oh! That is most wondrous news!${prompt}
  7780: The time hath come for the three of us to combine our strength.${prompt}
  7781: Together, let us forge a divinity that is powerful enough to destroy the World Eater Egg once and for all!${prompt}
  7782: By the three of us, you mean Odin, me, and ${name-player}!?${prompt}
  7783: |-
    Indeed...
    If you take the godly power of Lord Odin and combine it with the two weapons...${prompt}
  7784: It may be just enough to sever the power of the crystals from the astral plane!${prompt}
  7785: The time hath come to launch our assault!
  7786: Now wail as thy soul is bestrewn across the plains of Valhalla!
  7787: D-did we do it!?${prompt}
  7788: It be smashed to pieces!${prompt}
  7789: Y-you were actually able to b-break it!${prompt}
  7790: Thou hast done well.${prompt}
  7791: As proof of Chaos's complete and utter destruction...${prompt}
  7792: The path to the astral plane is closed, and the turmoil enveloping the living and the dead within this place shall soon subside.${prompt}
  7793: |-
    Behold...
    The brave souls who fell in battle are being revived!${prompt}
  7794: ${name-player}!
  7795: It would seem that you were successful!${prompt}
  7796: Amazing! You must tell us all about it!${prompt}
  7797: The time hath come for the living and the dead to go their separate ways...${prompt}
  7798: I leave the rest to thee, Duke Alloces.${prompt}
  7799: |-
    Fare thee well, my knight.
    I look forward to our next encounter.${prompt}
  7800: |-
    Fare thee well, ${name-player}.
    I look forward to our next encounter.${prompt}
  7801: Hey, what just happened!?
  7802: W-we've returned to C-Castle Zvahl.${prompt}
  7803: Isn't it obvious? We're home!${prompt}
  7804: |-
    I'm cold and tired...
    I just want to rest!${prompt}
  7805: Although, it seems that Duke Alloces wants to talk to you.${prompt}
  7806: You've been summoned!${prompt}
  7807: Do you remember the place where we often met?${prompt}
  7808: |-
    It's near the Beaucedine Glacier in Xarcabard.
    We'll see you there!${prompt}
  7809: You must meet with Duke Alloces near Beaucedine Glacier in Xarcabard.${prompt}
