  7178: Petty beastman hordes are nothing compared to giant wildebeests of homeland! I swat you all down like fruit flies!${prompt}
  7179: <Yawn>... Um... Holy light...show the way...?${prompt}
  7180: The protection of the throne comes before all else. Only by direct order of the royaulais will I wield my blade on the battlefield. Such is the duty of the Royal Guards.${prompt}
  7181: Hah hah hah! The ringing of steel upon steel! The dripping stench of the battlefield! What could be better than war? The nobles can have their balls, I'll do my dance on the front lines!${prompt}
  7182: How dare a baseborn peasant raise ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] voice to a noble knight!? Begone, before I strike you down myself!${prompt}
  7183: The Kingdom's defeat at Jugner still stings. To avenge the souls of those lost on that fateful day, we must join hands and take up arms as one.${prompt}
  7184: Not once in the four hundred years since the dawn of the Royal Knights has the Kingdom found itself in such peril. Let us take up our pikes and stand our ground to ensure another four centuries of prosperity!${prompt}
  7185: It is often in times of strife that a man's true nature is revealed. Will you stand tall in the face of fear, or run and cower in the wake of your mother's dress?${prompt}
  7186: While our holy doctrines specifically prohibit the taking of another life, you need not hesitate on the battlefield. The Church has branded the beastmen enemies of Altana. The purification must begin! It is the will of the Goddess!!!${prompt}

    After years of training in the Far East, I return only to find my nation burning at the hands of the infernal beastman hordes.
    The heathens shall pay dearly... My work has only just begun.${prompt}
  7188: You have the look of a fine warrior. It is a pity you are not one of my Crimson Wolves.${prompt}

    Turtle sleeps in a rocky den♪

  7192: We may have the upper hand in technology and munitions, but the enemy's advantage lies in their sheer numbers. The Allied Campaign will not win in a day, soldier. Make every bullet count.${prompt}
  7193: The Metalworks' strategies are too timid for my taste. The beastmen are nothing but dominoes, waiting to be toppled. A swift, aggressive assault is the only way to victory.${prompt}

    ...Heavy infantry, five columns of 200... Two 100-knight regiments... Enemy force casualties estimated at 5,000...
    Oh, I apologize, soldier. I've spent the past few nights preparing for a joint operation with San d'Oria's Royal Knights.${prompt}
  7197: You look like you've seen better days, soldier. Let me guess, it's the war that's bringing you down. What you need is a little music in your life!${prompt}
  7198: If it weren't for the Galkan heavy infantry, this nation wouldn't last a month against the turtlebacks. And what thanks do we get? A handful of stale army biscuits!${prompt}
  7199: Have you ever stopped to ponder what that comet might truly portend? I'd like to believe it is a message of hope--that soon this age of darkness will come to a close...${prompt}
  7200: Oh, whatever has become of my sweet Windurst? Rabble running through the streets, streets overrun with rabble! Why are you even speaking to me!? Does the title Master Caster no longer garner even an onz of respect!?${prompt}
  7201: Ah, the Fates have brought you to Gariri the Magnificent! Why am I thus called, you ask? Why, because only I was magnificent enough to decryptify those mysteriously marvelous Near Eastern tomes and open a window to...the Other Side!${prompt}
  7202: We all wear masks because deep down inside we are nothing but beasts. The question I ask you is, to which do you submit--the mask, or the beast?${prompt}

  7204: If only the Parliament of Patriarchs would loosen the strings on their purses a little more, I would be outside right now roasting up a couple birdmen to snack on!${prompt}
  7205: Have fun while you can, filthy mercenary, because before long you'll be back on the streets where you belong--replaced by a quiet, obedient army of Cardians!${prompt}
  7206: Normally, it is my duty to protect the patriarchs of parliament, but with the fate of Windurst in doubt, I'm forced to lead my loyal pets to the front lines.${prompt}
  7207: Do you like the headpiece? I made it from my firrrst victim. I wear it to let everrryone know what happens when they cross Mikhe Aryohcha!${prompt}
  7208: Back in my home, Ulbuka, I hear rumors of great riches in eastern lands. But now I am here, and where are riches? I see nothing but Tarus! Ahahahaha!${prompt}
  7209: <Yaaawn>... Mastering these Near Eastern magics can be quite taxing. If I had a choice, I'd rather be back in bed, relaxing...${prompt}

    In former times, this island was inhabited by a ferocious tribe of vikings.
    It is said they braved vast expanses of open sea to arrive here.
    Romantic, don't you think?${prompt}
  7231: |-
    Surely you have seen the tigers that roam these downs.
    They were brought from the northern continent by the Orcs themselves.
    They are highly prized for their luxurious pelts, though their bloodlust makes them formidable game.${prompt}

    The brotherhood of this place once welcomed me long ago.

    The Gold Musketeers of the Republican Army are marshalled by young woman.

    Bastok was forced to abandon the Palborough Mines following a Beastman invasion.
    How an army such as the Republic's could permit such an affront baffles me to no end.${prompt}
  7235: |-
    The village elder in La Vaule told me of the so-called wyrm deity of Grauberg.
    Of course, I am sure it is nothing more than folktales. Still, my curiosity is piqued...${prompt}

    Strange... I am certain the vegetation of this area is different from when I last visited.
    Surely I would not have allowed myself to forget such beautiful flowers.${prompt}

    Such devasation...
    Even the resilient Goobbue were not able to survive.
    I wonder if this place shall ever be restored to its former glory...${prompt}
  7238: History tells us that it was in the year 381 that San d'Oria's iron-tempered  King Lanfeaur R d'Oraguille came these lands to strike a peace with the Quadav. Whatever happened to the bond that was formed...?${prompt}
  7239: |-
    I have seen here two twins who between them share a power for magic the likes of which I have never seen.

    Never have I felt a cold as piercing as this.
    My teeth chatter and my toes grow numb.

  7247: |-
    Never did I imagine the day would come that I would set foot in this accursed place.
    Has great is our foe's desperation? Do not lower your guard, ${name-player}.${prompt}

    And so we breach the enemy's inner sanctum. Expect anything, ${name-player}!

  7249: As the Allied Forces have long maintained, this citadel would be ideally suited to the defense of Jeuno.${prompt}

    A well conceived strategy...

  7981: That reminds me of when I trekked out here last. I was playing my favorite tune, when I caught glimpse of a little girl, a dancer. She must have heard my melody, because she started to dance. She was so pure, so full of joy and radiance, I was sincerely touched.${prompt}

  7983: When the war is over, I plan to start a traveling circus troupe that will bring smiles and laughter wherever it goes.${prompt}

  8028: Perhaps he is more of a man than I had measured him for.${prompt}
  8029: |-
    Very well. I shall return his beloved blade.
    As a present from you, we shall say.${prompt}
  8030: |-
    Forgive me, but there are still fish to be caught before my return.
    Tell my son that I will be along in due time.${prompt}
  8031: |-
    My thanks again for what you did for my son.
    I shall endeavor to see him raised to be as strong and honorable as yourself.${prompt}
  8032: 'The ${item-singular: 0[2]} was returned to you.${prompt}'
  8033: A squad of Orcs?${prompt}
  8034: ${name-player}, look yonder!${prompt}
  8035: Hogdazdek!${prompt}
  8036: "Darvylle, I would advise against keeping Buchzvotch waiting. \nHe is far from patient, even by Orc standards, so let's finish this and be on our way.${prompt}"
  8037: So you finally show your true colors, Temple Knight Darvylle.${prompt}
  8038: I had my suspicions from the very beginning.${prompt}
  8039: |-
    I commend you on your fine detective work.
    But, I am saddened to say that it was all for naught.${prompt}
  8040: |-
    Betraying your king, and selling out your own comrades to the enemy...
    No words could describe my contempt for you.${prompt}
  8041: |-
    Now, answer me!
    What evil objective lies behind these unforgiveable acts of treason!?${prompt}
  8042: |-
    Your words wound me, Altennia.
    Why, I simply wish to restore my most precious San d'Oria to her former glory.${prompt}
  8043: |-
    ...?
    What do you mean?${prompt}
  8044: |-
    The tyrant king, Destin R d'Oraguille...
    He will meet his end at the hands of my sympathizers.${prompt}
  8045: |-
    I can see it even now...
    It will be exactly like ten years past, when King Grantieul was “regrettably” slain by Orcs.${prompt}
  8046: Wh-what?${prompt}
  8047: Grrraaaaaagh!${prompt}
  8048: |-
    D-Darvylle!
    Buchzvotch's patience is about to run dry!${prompt}
  8049: |-
    It is I who has to bear the brunt of his fury.
    You would do me a great favor by delaying no further!${prompt}
  8050: "Blast! \nHow are we to help her with all those Orcs swarming about?${prompt}"
  8051: And...to where did Excenmille disappear?${prompt}
  8052: |-
    <Sigh>
    Apart from Zogbog here, these Orcs understand not the joys of refined conversation.
    I am afraid the pleasantries end here.${prompt}
  8053: W-we must act now, or else!${prompt}
  8054: Uwaaaaaaaaah!
  8055: |-
    Excenmille?
    How did you know...!?${prompt}
  8056: Y-you again!?${prompt}
  8057: E-Excenmille!?${prompt}
  8058: ${name-player}! Now is our chance!${prompt}
  8059: I am flattered you came all the way here to see me...${prompt}
  8060: "What have I done to deserve such a delicious treat? \nYou have made my day, little rabbit!${prompt}"
  8061: |-
    I would sooner turn blind than endure a daily dose of your face, Zogbog!
    Today we settle the score!${prompt}
  8062: Rahal...and ${name-player} as well!?${prompt}
  8063: |-
    Well, well...
    With all the guests of honor present, the party can finally begin!${prompt}
  8064: |-
    Gahahahaha!
    I look forward to roasting you on my cookfire, little rabbit!${prompt}
  8065: Krogkrakblek!${prompt}

  8068: |-
    ......
    Vokbrokgreg!!!${prompt}
  8069: |-
    I regret to inform you Buchzvotch is not in the best of moods at the moment.
    It would seem that you are all...“too alive” for him.${prompt}
  8070: Th-that Orc is enormous!${prompt}
  8071: '......${prompt}'
  8072: |-
    ${name-player}!
    You have my leave to tend to the big one.${prompt}
  8073: Lieutenant Rahal and I will see to the rest.${prompt}
  8074: |-
    And one more thing, ${name-player}.
    If I deem your performance unsatisfactory, you will be put on cleaning detail. Understood?${prompt}
  8075: Rahal! Chaaaaaarge!${prompt}
  8076: Good luck, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  8077: Grrraaaaaagh!!!${prompt}
  8078: Gwaaaaaaah!${prompt}
  8079: C-curses!!!${prompt}
  8080: |-
    Veggrok!
    It would appear I sorely underestimated you, little rabbits...${prompt}
  8081: This is not over! I shall return...with reinforcements!${prompt}
  8082: Fleeing like a coward again, Zogbog!?${prompt}
  8083: |-
    “Flee,” you say!? Spare me your mockery!
    This is merely a “tactical withdrawal”!${prompt}
  8084: But mark my words... I shall be back for your head!${prompt}
  8085: No one will rob me of revenge for my fallen clan!${prompt}
  8086: |-
    Glekvuk!
    Retrea--I mean, move out!${prompt}
  8087: "That Zogbog... \nWhen we last fought, he spoke of the same “revenge.” To what could he possibly be referring?${prompt}"
  8088: I cannot say...${prompt}
  8089: By the way, ${name-player}...${prompt}
  8090: You shall commence cleaning detail after returning to headquarters. I trust you understand the reason?${prompt}
  8091: Your negligence had the Young Griffons half a heartbeat away from having mincemeat for a captain!${prompt}
  8092: Excenmille.${prompt}
  8093: Wh-what is it now, Altennia?${prompt}
  8094: I rushed here without a thought for my own safety, so the least you could do is--${prompt}
  8095: Thank you...${prompt}
  8096: '!?${prompt}'
  8097: A-Altennia...${prompt}
  8098: Sh-she is clearly suffering from trauma. We must--${prompt}
  8099: Excenmille! Here I am trying to show my gratitude in earnest, and you...${prompt}
  8100: <Sigh>${prompt}
  8101: And thank you two as well, Rahal and ${name-player}...${prompt}
  8102: To all of you, I owe my life.${prompt}
  8103: Wh-what?${prompt}
  8104: |-
    Doggvdegg!
    The Orc general who laid siege to San d'Oria!${prompt}
  8105: What shall we do, Excenmille!?${prompt}
  8106: Excenmille?${prompt}
  8107: ${name-player}, we must evacuate immediately.${prompt}
  8108: Th-that is...Bakgodek, of the Steelhide Horde! ${prompt}
  8109: Whence did their forces come to be so near!?${prompt}
  8110: '......${prompt}'
  8111: |-
    Theirs must have been the unit stationed at La Vaule.
    But, they were reportedly marching for Jeuno...${prompt}

  8113: (Ah...!)${prompt}
  8114: Excenmille, we stand not a chance against such numbers! It would be folly to even consider pursuit.${prompt}
  8115: Excenmille?${prompt}
  8116: Here they are! Has harm come to any of you!?${prompt}
  8117: Altennia! You are safe!${prompt}
  8118: Father!${prompt}
  8119: Why, Excenmille. And be this not Rahal, Lord Lebrart's very own flesh and blood?${prompt}
  8120: Is this carnage I see before me all your doing?${prompt}
  8121: Sir! We have located Temple Knight Darvylle in the creek bed!${prompt}
  8122: |-
    Darvylle, too?
    Apprehend the traitor, posthaste!${prompt}
  8123: We'd best not linger longer than necessary. If the Orcish host were to find us, they would not receive us kindly.${prompt}
  8124: You must be ${name-player}. Altennia has informed me of your bravery. You have my gratitude.${prompt}

    Captain, we know not when the enemy may attempt another foray.
    Best we use this respite to down what food we can.${prompt}
  8142: Machegue, furnish me with some hard bread from the rations sack, will you?${prompt}
  8143: Um...Cyranuce. It appears the sack and I were separated in the course of the skirmish.${prompt}
  8144: What!? B-but...my poor stomach...${prompt}
  8145: Ah!${prompt}

    <Sniff, sniff> This enticing aroma... Could it truly be biscuits a la Rholont!?
    Thank you, ${name-player}! All of us were on the verge of starvation!${prompt}
  8150: |-
    Ah, the rich yet uncloying sweetness of Ronfaure maple syrup dances on my tongue!
    It reminds me so of Mother's home-baked pies!${prompt}
  8151: |-
    Oh, torture me not with the mention of Mother's mouthwatering pies!
    But I say, the water is especially refreshing after having experienced the sludgy variety the forest has to offer.${prompt}
  8152: |-
    All right, Griffins.
    We leave to rejoin the main force once those who took wounds have partaken of their rations.${prompt}
  8153: |-
    Hmm... The sounding of the war drums has ceased.
    It would appear the enemy has finally withdrawn.${prompt}
  8154: |-
    And not a moment too soon!
    We owe it all to Rholont and ${name-player} for having managed to survive this far without having to skip a meal.${prompt}
  8155: Hear, hear! The biscuits certainly put a spring in your step, Cyranuce, if only for the purpose of fleeing from danger.${prompt}
  8156: A-and what do you imply by that!?${prompt}
  8157: |-
    Lads. Glad am I to see you unscathed, but forget not for a second that you stand on a battlefield.
    The briefest lapses in concentration have allowed stray arrows to claim the lives of many a great hero.${prompt}
  8158: Yes, sir! Thank you, sir!${prompt}
  8159: Hm?${prompt}
  8160: C-Captain Rahal, look yonder!${prompt}
  8161: Zogbog... There's no mistaking him.${prompt}
  8162: Not again!? But...what are we to do?${prompt}
  8163: 'All of us know full well the answer to that question: we go exact revenge!${prompt}'
  8164: Do you not agree, Captain?${prompt}
  8165: |-
    Wholeheartedly. But for now, we do no more than shadow Zogbog's movements.
    If he has devised any more fiendish plots, it would serve the Kingdom best that we learn of them.${prompt}
  8166: Um...doesn't protocol require that we first seek the leave of the commanding off--?${prompt}
  8167: H-hey! Captain! Cyranuce! Waaait!${prompt}
  8168: |-
    C-Captain. The entire area is swarming with Orcs.
    Perhaps we should double back and--${prompt}
  8169: Hush! I can't make out a single word of their conversation...${prompt}
  8170: |-
    Well, they speak in the Orcish tongue, so that's only to be expected.
    Psst, Machegue.${prompt}
  8171: You learned rudimentary Orcish from Sir Vailanice, did you not? What are they saying?${prompt}
  8172: Huh? You were there for the lessons, too, weren't you? Use your own ears!${prompt}
  8173: |-
    Y-you misunderstand.
    I could comprehend their gibberish with ease if I so chose, but doing so would uh...distract me from performing my duty as lookout.${prompt}
  8174: (You. When is the general due to arrive?)${prompt}
  8175: |-
    (Recent defeats very displease General Doggvdegg.
    He comes after he punish incompetent officers with death.)${prompt}

  8177: (Tsk-tsk. You speak ill of general. The general hear of this.)${prompt}
  8178: (Bah! Do as you please, despicable lickspittle!)${prompt}
  8179: (Hm?)${prompt}
  8180: |-
    (This warmachine I see before me--its maintenance is your doing?
    I am not easily impressed, but this is excellent work.)${prompt}

    (Master Zogbog speak very kind.
    My mind slow, but me fix good. Master Zogbog ask, me fix.)${prompt}
  8182: |-
    (You are to be commended, soldier.
    Take this, and know that Zogbog rewards those who serve him well.)${prompt}
  8183: (Huh? This strange stone Master Zogbog give. It not made by Orc.)${prompt}
  8184: |-
    (Hahaha, good eyes to go with your deft hands, I see.
    But that is not all. This blueprint, I bestow upon you also.)${prompt}

  8191: |-
    (Soon, my lord...
    Soon, an explosion of colossal scale will occur at the Tavnazian Peninsula and forever sunder the Marquisate from the mainland.)${prompt}
  8192: (It is imperative that our main force stationed there is recalled before it can be swallowed up by the land.)${prompt}
  8193: (You listen, Zogbog.)${prompt}
  8194: (My lord.)${prompt}
  8195: (Your strange foresight serve Empire well.)${prompt}
  8196: (Thank you, my lord.)${prompt}
  8197: |-
    (But lately, you contribute only empty promise. No result.
    You flee from Garlaige with tail between leg. Today, you fail again. Many good soldier fall. What I say to Emperor?)${prompt}

  8202: (You speak nonsense! To Tavnazia with you!)${prompt}
  8203: (Tav...Tavnazia!?)${prompt}
  8204: |-
    (Nooo! General Doggvdegg, I implore you!
    A-another chance...please grant me but one more chance at redemption!)${prompt}
  8205: (Sniveling dog! You disgust me!)${prompt}
  8206: (You go to Tavnazia! Or your fortune-telling day are over, now!)${prompt}

    (I-I beg you, Your Mercifulness! I submit myself to all forthcoming punishment, but please hear out my words!
    Consider this the final wish of a condemned man!)${prompt}

  8209: (T-Tavnazia...it concerns Tavnazia's defensive walls!)${prompt}
  8210: '...${prompt}'

    (The strength of the Marquisate's walls is such that they are oft compared to iron.
    'Tis common knowledge that they have been the source of endless vexation for our main force.)${prompt}
  8212: (What you say?)${prompt}
  8213: |-
    (I have a plan, O Mighty Doggvdegg...
    A plan to demolish the very walls that have stymied our army for the longest time.)${prompt}
  8214: (It would be my pleasure to share the details with my lord, but doing so requires that my head remain intact.)${prompt}
  8215: |-
    (Hmph... You smooth-talk your way out of punishment yet again.
    But fail me once more, I rip out your tongue.)${prompt}
  8216: |-
    (Th-thank you, my lord! I shan't disappoint you again!
    Now, if you'd but accompany me to Vunkerl Inlet, it is there that the driving force of my strategy lies in wait.)${prompt}
  8217: |-
    The Vunkerl Inlet...
    Captain, I like the sound of this not one bit.
    What could Zogbog possibly be scheming this time?${prompt}
  8218: |-
    Rahal, this situation is well over our heads.
    Best we hasten back and report this development to the bearded brute.${prompt}
  8219: |-
    ...I have a plan.
    We split up into two groups.${prompt}
  8220: |-
    Machegue, I need you to rejoin the Iron Rams.
    Return with them to San d'Oria and deliver word to General Cousseraux.${prompt}
  8221: Yes, sir! Leave it to me, sir!${prompt}
  8222: Myself, Cyranuce, and ${name-player} will make for Vunkerl Inlet.${prompt}
  8223: The three of us will stay on Zogbog's trail and try to learn what we can of his latest machination.${prompt}
  8224: (Ah! ${name-player}, to me!)${prompt}
  8225: (Look thither. It appears we've found Zogbog before Excenmille did.)${prompt}
  8226: (Let us stay in hiding and observe for now.)${prompt}
  8227: (Hmm. The pupils are dilated...which means the sedative is working as intended, I trust?)${prompt}
  8228: (Yes, Master Zogbog.)${prompt}
  8229: (This here makes the fourth.)${prompt}
  8230: |-
    (Unlike the first three we sent prior, this one is yet a stripling among behemoths. But what it lacks in size, it makes up for in sheer foulness of temperament.
    I pity the poor souls hiding behind Tavnazia's walls when this one is set loose.)${prompt}
  8231: (Hm? What's this?)${prompt}
  8232: |-
    (Most curious...
    Even in this semi-conscious state, its primal instincts drive it to seek and discern the scent of prey.
    To think that such a fearsome predator is at our disposal... Mwahahahaha...)${prompt}
  8233: (You. Come closer.)${prompt}
  8234: |-
    Ahem! Ga-ha-ha-ha-ha! At long last the preparations are complete!
    Now then! Without further ado, send forth myself and the last of our mighty behemoths, so that we may lay waste to Tavnazia!${prompt}
  8235: (I try, Master Zogbog...)${prompt}
  8236: Hm? That light...${prompt}
  8237: Excenmille, stay back! It's a trap!${prompt}
  8238: Damn! We were too late!${prompt}
  8239: Sir Jayramus! What was that light?${prompt}
  8240: |-
    'Twas some manner of teleportation magic.
    A short-ranged one, to be sure, as no spell exists that can effectively transport massive creatures like that behemoth over any considerable distance.${prompt}
  8241: |-
    But our primary concern now is Excenmille.
    He, too, was swallowed up into the teleportation rift.${prompt}
  8242: |-
    In all logic, they should not be far from here.
    Best we split up and search the area.${prompt}
  8243: |-
    Hm? What are you doing?
    Now is not the time for this tomfoolery!${prompt}
  8244: |-
    Hush! I hear something...
    The spine-chilling roar of beasts...and a flurry of footfalls...${prompt}
  8245: Those crafty fiends! They're directly below us!${prompt}
  8246: The Orcs have made a hiding place out of the Gromil Caverns beneath Jugner Forest. I'm sure of it.${prompt}
  8247: Gromil Caverns?${prompt}
  8248: In our youth, Count Aurchiat and I would oft steal away from the safety of the city walls and explore its labyrinthine network of caves.${prompt}
  8249: If memory serves me correctly, the entrance should be somewhere nearby.${prompt}
  8250: Are you certain you can find it again after all these years?${prompt}
  8251: |-
    Some things one never forgets, lad.
    Another detail I've not forgotten is that the caverns are riddled with steep climbs and treacherous footing. We will need a good length of rope to negotiate our way.${prompt}
  8252: |-
    The ivy growing in these parts seems fairly sturdy.
    What if we gathered some and wove them into a makeshift rope?${prompt}
  8253: |-
    You're sharp for your years, lad.
    Mayhap great things can be expected of you.${prompt}
  8254: |-
    You two, go and find us some Jugner ivy.
    I'll be scouting the cavern entrance for enemy presence in the meantime.${prompt}
  8255: Here, you might be needing this.${prompt}
  8256: I haven't spares, though, so make it count.${prompt}
  8257: Hasten back here as soon as you've found some ivy.${prompt}
  8258: Cardinal Stag Knight Jayramus bids you find some Jugner ivy.${prompt}
  8259: You've found us an ample amount of ivy, I see. Well done.${prompt}
  8260: I, too, have managed to locate the entrance to the Gromil Caverns. However...${prompt}
  8261: However...?${prompt}
  8262: The Orcs have gone and erected a pair of guard posts in the vicinity.${prompt}
  8263: What!?${prompt}
  8264: No need to fret, lad. Both seemed to have been abandoned, or perhaps the occupants are in the midst of a patrol. I doubt we need to pay them much mind, but I thought to mention it nevertheless. Let us away.${prompt}
  8265: We're here.${prompt}
  8266: Hmm... The area seems clear of enemy lookouts.${prompt}
  8267: |-
    By the Goddess...
    I never knew such an expansive cavern existed here.${prompt}
  8268: I would offer a picturesque tour of the environs, but that must wait until after we've secured Excenmille.${prompt}
  8269: Blast it! Not this place again!${prompt}
  8270: That Zogbog... Where could he have gone?${prompt}
  8271: You seek an audience with me, Lord Excenmille?${prompt}
  8272: '!?${prompt}'
  8273: Show yourself, craven!${prompt}
  8274: |-
    As it please you, my lord.
    But be warned that the odds are “heavily” stacked against you. Gahahahaha!${prompt}
  8275: |-
    Y-your ploy to unnerve me will not succeed, fiend!
    I'm a knight and defender of the Kingdom, and son of Alphonimile M Aurchiat!
    The blood of heroes courses through my veins! Come, do your worst!${prompt}
  8276: That roar!? A behemoth is near!${prompt}
  8277: |-
    “Son”...? Ah, yes, I remember that word.
    After all, I too was once a son. I had a father and mother, and siblings whom I grew up alongside.
    Life was hard, but I knew peace and contentment nonetheless. Who could ask for more?${prompt}
  8278: |-
    But one day, without warning, all of this was taken away from me.
    My village was razed to the ground, and my entire family, put to the sword in an unprovoked attack by a band of intruders led by a merciless savage.${prompt}
  8279: I can hear an Orc speaking! We're close!${prompt}
  8280: |-
    What are you blabbering on about?
    None of this concerns me!${prompt}
  8281: |-
    Doesn't concern you, you say? Oh, but it will.
    For mine is a revenge that traverses time...${prompt}
  8282: Traverses time? What is this nonsense?${prompt}
  8283: You will find out soon enough.${prompt}
  8284: |-
    Hmph! If it's of revenge you wish to speak, then I'll have you know mine!
    You and your loathsome Bloodwing Horde are the ones who murdered Mother! This much I know!${prompt}
  8285: '!!!${prompt}'
  8286: |-
    Gahaha... Gahahahahaha!
    Why, I suppose this makes the two of us rivals in revenge! How cruel and ironic the heavens can be!${prompt}
  8287: |-
    This changes everything.
    Now that we're properly acquainted, we can do away with all the pleasantries.${prompt}
  8288: Go, my pretty!${prompt}
  8289: Go forth and crush the life and future out of that puny Elvaan!${prompt}
  8290: Excenmille!${prompt}
  8291: Save the tearful reunion for afterwards! The enemy comes!${prompt}
  8292: |-
    (Pre...preposterous.
    How could a behemoth be felled by a pair of ordinary soldiers and mere children?)${prompt}
  8293: C-curses!${prompt}
  8294: We're not done yet, Zogbog!${prompt}
  8295: Excenmille! No!${prompt}
  8296: |-
    Confound it!
    The semblance that child bears to his late mother can be insufferable at times!${prompt}
  8297: |-
    <Pant, pant>...
    Prepare yourself, Zogbog! We finish this now!${prompt}
  8298: (Ack! Is this the end...?)${prompt}
  8299: |-
    (I come to see commotion.
    Who I find but you, Zogbog!)${prompt}
  8300: (G-General Doggvdegg!)${prompt}
  8301: (You flee from handful of pointy-ear!?)${prompt}
  8302: |-
    (Be deceived not by their numbers, my lord.
    These four alone slew one of our fiercest behemoths.)${prompt}
  8303: (What you say!?)${prompt}
  8304: I say, the situation grows grimmer by the second...${prompt}
  8305: |-
    First, a foul-tempered young behemoth, and now, a whole herd of bloodthirsty pigmen--all within the span of an hour.
    I shan't soon forget this day...${prompt}
  8306: Doggvdegg...${prompt}
  8307: Hold it!${prompt}
  8308: Huh!?${prompt}
  8309: Father!?${prompt}
  8310: (Pointy-ear cavalry!? Where they come from!?)${prompt}
  8311: |-
    Maintain close formation, valiant Knights of the Cardinal Stag!
    Chaaarge!${prompt}
  8312: |-
    (Grrr! Take battle to enemy and fight like Orc!
    Try to run, I slay you myself!)
  8313: (Master Zogbog! Dire news!)${prompt}
  8314: '...${prompt}'
  8315: (What did you say!?)${prompt}
  8316: |-
    (Gahahaha!
    Enemy are very few! We encircle and demolish!)${prompt}
  8317: (General!)${prompt}
  8318: '...${prompt}'
  8319: |-
    (What!? Reinforcement from San d'Oria!?
    How they come so fast!?)${prompt}
  8320: |-
    (This position is indefensible, my lord!
    Lingering here would equate to suicide!)${prompt}
  8321: |-
    (Hmph! You speak obvious!
    Bloodwing Horde, we withdraw!)${prompt}
  8322: Excenmille! Go no further!${prompt}
  8323: '!?${prompt}'
  8324: |-
    A pursuit order has not been issued, soldier.
    Stay here and tend to the wounded.${prompt}
  8325: |-
    But why, Father!?
    That was Doggvdegg, the Orc who murdered Mother!${prompt}
  8326: I said, tend to the wounded! This is an order!${prompt}
  8327: Damn it!${prompt}
  8328: It would seem I am forming an atrocious habit of relying on you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8329: At the very least, I believe I owe you the courtesy of sharing what was written in the letter from Rongelouts.${prompt}
  8330: |-
    The letter simply reads thus:
    “Disquieting rumors surround Tavnazia. Expedite elimination of behemoth.”${prompt}
  8331: |-
    A cryptic message, to be sure, but the friendship that I hold dear between myself and Rongelouts demanded that I heed these words.
    Thus, I gathered my knights and made my way here.${prompt}
  8332: And what should the faith I placed in an old comrade gain me, but the life of one of my knights and heir to House Aurchiat both?${prompt}
  8333: Thanking Rongelouts is the first thing I shall do upon return to San d'Oria.${prompt}
  8334: Cyranuce.${prompt}
  8335: Hm?${prompt}
  8336: About Machegue...${prompt}
  8337: Say not another word!${prompt}
  8338: You envy that Machegue fulfilled our shared childhood dream of becoming a knight before any of us.${prompt}
  8339: That's what you meant to say. Am I right?${prompt}
  8340: Yes, Cyranuce...that's exactly right.${prompt}
  8341: ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8342: You've saved my neck yet again.${prompt}
  8343: This time, Father is resolute in his mission to go to Tavnazia's aid, no matter what fate may await us there.${prompt}
  8344: Boy! There'll be time enough to prattle with friends by the fireplace when you've become a wrinkly old man! We leave now!${prompt}
  8345: I continue on the expedition. But come what may, I want the two of you to survive. Also...${prompt}
  8346: Rahal, right? We'll be sure to pass your regards on to him, and brag about our most recent exploits in the process.${prompt}
  8347: Thank you...and farewell!${prompt}
  8348: |-
    Let us return to San d'Oria, ${name-player}.
    Pain my heart though it may, I must be the one to tell Mother of Machegue's fate.${prompt}
  8349: Nothing happens...${prompt}
  8350: |-
    You see the tracks of a three-taloned, dog-like beast on the ground.
    They appear to be territorial markings...${prompt}
  8351: |-
    Haha!!!
    You're mine now, you pompous crown-wearing feline!
  8352: '...Huh?'
  8353: ${name-player}!?${prompt}
  8354: What do you think you're doing, wandering into the trap I'd laid out for that furball Cait Sith!?${prompt}
  8355: |-
    <Sigh>...
    Well, don't just lie there like a dolt. Up with you! Up!${prompt}
  8356: And who have we here?${prompt}
  8357: Be this a friend of yours, Lili?${prompt}
  8358: 'Ooh, I recognize ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]! ${lettercase: 1}${choice-player-gender}[He/She]''s the one we snagged in Ronfaure the other day!${prompt}'
  8359: Eh? You've been busy cozying up with this hunk of a man here, Lili, but never thought to tell us?${prompt}
  8360: |-
    <Gasp>! Our ferocious, fang-baring Lili's finally managed to bag herself a...boyfriend!?
    And look, not even the slightest hint of a broken nose or dislocated jaw on him!${prompt}
  8361: 'H-hey, stop jumping to deluded conclusions!${prompt} '
  8362: So, you're a friend of Lili's, eh?${prompt}
  8363: But, my... I don't know how I failed to notice before, but you're absolutely gorgeous!${prompt}
  8364: You should seriously consider signing up for our dance troupe. All the men would fight tooth and nail just for a gander at a stunner like you on stage!${prompt}
  8365: |-
    Hear, hear!
    Our dance troupe is the greatest. You get to travel to all sorts of exotic destinations, with board and lodging guaranteed! Win enough hearts, and a lucrative endorsement deal wouldn't be far-fetched, either!${prompt}
  8366: H-hey, stop planting crazy ideas into ${name-player}'s head!${prompt}
  8367: |-
    Hmph! I've suffered enough of your overactive imaginations for one day!
    I can handle the rest by myself, so get back to San d'Oria, the whole lot of you! Troupe dismissed!${prompt}
  8368: Awww...${prompt}
  8369: Well, we've been out here for too long as it is. Any longer, and the boss'll be screaming for the hides off our backs.${prompt}
  8370: |-
    Agreed!
    A break from this catty obsession would do you a world of good, too, Lili.${prompt}
  8371: |-
    And one more thing, before I forget.
    Don't you think using fish as bait to catch a cat is a wee bit...cliched?${prompt}
  8372: A-away with you!${prompt}
  8373: |-
    <Sigh>...
    ${name-player}, I trust it is still your intention to honor the promise you made?${prompt}
  8374: The promise to help me capture Cait Sith and save Sir Ragelise...${prompt}
  8375: After which, we make our long-awaited intercontinental debut as the professional tag-team duo, “Future Fabulous”?${prompt}
  8376: |-
    Will you honor your promise?
    ${selection-lines}
    I surely will.
    Um, may I review the contract...?${prompt}
  8377: |-
    Great! I never doubted you for a second, ${name-player}!
    Now, with me! We're staking out that bumptious feline...${prompt}
  8378: |-
    Review what!? You've already given me your word, and that's the last I'll hear of it!
    Now, with me! We're staking out that bumptious feline...${prompt}
  8379: '...${prompt}'
  8380: '......${prompt}'
  8381: She's nowhere to be seen...${prompt}
  8382: |-
    Are we doing something wrong?
    Perhaps the bait is too...cliched, like Tanja suggested?${prompt}
  8383: ${name-player}, do you think we ought to try something different as bait?${prompt}
  8384: |-
    Try a new bait?
    ${selection-lines}
    It might be for the best.
    Cats love fish, right?${prompt}
  8385: |-
    Alright...
    But, what else would be worth trying?${prompt}
  8386: Naturally! Why did I ever doubt myself?${prompt}
  8387: But still, that doesn't rule out the possibility that something more effective exists.${prompt}
  8388: I've an idea. Let's review the intelligence we've gathered on our target so far. After all, knowing the enemy is half the battle!${prompt}
  8389: Now, ${name-player}. What manner of creature do you think Cait Sith actually is?${prompt}
  8390: |-
    What is Cait Sith?
    ${selection-lines}
    A cat of unknown breed.
    A Mithran child.
    A cat, yet, not a cat.${prompt}
  8391: |-
    Hmmm, I see...
    Moving on, what do you think her paw pads feel like to the touch?${prompt}
  8392: |-
    Cait Sith's paw pads are...
    ${selection-lines}
    Irresistibly soft.
    Tautly firm.
    Unpleasantly coarse.${prompt}
  8393: |-
    Uh-huh...
    Next, what do you think she likes?${prompt}
  8394: |-
    What does Cait Sith like best?
    ${selection-lines}
    High places.
    The almighty gil.
    Culinary delights.${prompt}
  8395: |-
    Hmmm, I thought as much...
    That reminds me, what color are her eyes again?${prompt}
  8396: |-
    Cait Sith's eyes are...
    ${selection-lines}
    Blue, like the summer sky.
    Yellow, like the setting sun.
    Green, with envy.${prompt}
  8397: What kind of noise does she make when she cries?${prompt}
  8398: |-
    How does Cait Sith cry?
    ${selection-lines}
    Kupoarrr.
    Grrrowl.
    Meowww.${prompt}
  8399: |-
    From my recollections of her appearance, I can't shake the feeling that something's missing...
    But, what could that something possibly be?${prompt}
  8400: |-
    What does Cait Sith lack, appearance-wise?
    ${selection-lines}
    Cuteness.
    Savageness.
    A pair of knee-high bottes.${prompt}
  8401: I see, I see...${prompt}
  8402: Based on your answers, I've concluded that to lure out Cait Sith, we should use...${prompt}
  8403: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} as bait!${prompt}'
  8404: While cats undeniably love fish, surely they find tender cuts of meat just as, if not more, appealing!${prompt}
  8405: Considering the fancy-shmancy crown she likes to wear atop its ridiculously disproportionate head, I should've guessed that Cait Sith is a slave to worldly riches. Our victory is as good as sealed the instant she casts her greedy eyes on our glimmering, golden bait!${prompt}
  8406: Cats are incurably playful creatures, and Cait Sith is no exception! An instinct-driven pounce upon a seemingly harmless toy--our bait--will be her undoing!${prompt}
  8407: 'Now, ${name-player}, your task is to fetch ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  8408: I'll have a new trap rigged up and ready to go by the time you come back.${prompt}
  8409: You see numerous sets of elegant footprints.${prompt}
  8410: 'Lilisette is preparing a new trap in an attempt to catch the ever-elusive Cait Sith. Bring her ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to use as bait.${prompt}'
  8411: '${color-alt: 121}Lilisette''s questions: ${number: 6}.'
  8412: ${name-player}, you're finally back!${prompt}
  8413: We'll have the cat in the bag at long last. Heheheheheh...${prompt}
  8414: She's here!${prompt}
  8415: Oh?
  8416: And what might this be, hmmm?${prompt}
  8417: M-meow!?
  8418: Hissssss!!!${prompt}
  8419: I have you now!${prompt}
  8420: |-
    Wh-what is the meaning of this!?
    Release me, I say! Catch and release!${prompt}
  8421: |-
    Not a chance, cat!
    I have many questions, and you'll oblige me with the answers if you know what's good for you.${prompt}
  8422: I want to know all about what happened at La Vaule...and more!${prompt}
  8423: |-
    アンタたち、それから
    あの羽根帽子に紫装束の奴らの正体……${prompt}
  8424: |-
    それから、奴らに見せられた
    あの、ヴィジョン……！${prompt}
  8425: Wh-what are you talking about? Haven't a clue.${prompt}
  8426: Heheheheheh...${prompt}
  8427: Don't play the fool with me, cat! You're really trying what little patience I have!${prompt}
  8428: Owww, it hurts! Aaah, the pain!${prompt}
  8429: You have the ability to manipulate time, don't you? Take us back to before when the incident at La Vaule occurred!${prompt}
  8430: I must go back and save Fath--I mean, Sir Ragelise! Please!${prompt}
  8431: '...?${prompt}'
  8432: |-
    Ah, I understand now! Finally clear!
    The insolent young slip of a girl Naoi mentioned!${prompt}
  8433: '...?${prompt}'
  8434: Now it all makes sense. Falling into place.${prompt}
  8435: Sorry, but your plight is not our concern. Falling on deaf ears.${prompt}
  8436: For our own reasons did we open Atomos.${prompt}
  8437: You're little more than playing pieces on a chess board. Pieces to be pla--${prompt}
  8438: Need I remind you of the position you're in now? I suggest you choose your words with greater tact!${prompt}
  8439: And don't think I've forgotten about what your swiping claws did to my immaculate complexion! I'm holding you accountable should this disfiguration cause ticket sales to slump!${prompt}
  8440: |-
    Ugh...let go...
    Losing...consciousness...${prompt}
  8441: Now, listen to me! If we don't save Father, the Crystal War will be lost!${prompt}
  8442: Don't you see? Father--Ragelise B Baloumat--is supposed to go down in history as the hero of the Battle of Jeuno! Without his deeds, the battle would not have ended in favor of the Allied Forces!${prompt}
  8443: The Battle...
  8444: Of...
  8445: Jeu...
  8446: '...No?'
  8447: Was everyone able to catch all of that? Were you tuned in?${prompt}
  8448: Uwaaah!?${prompt}
  8449: |-
    One, two, three...
    Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?${prompt}
  8450: |-
    You again?
    Quite the nuisance you're proving to be. A proverbial thorn in the side.${prompt}
  8451: Ah, they must be the ones Naoi spoke of. Had a run in.${prompt}
  8452: Why do you insist on impeding our mission so? Make difficult our nine lives?${prompt}
  8453: Look! Just help Sir Ragelise already!${prompt}
  8454: |-
    Yes, yes, with regards to that matter...
    That Ragelise B Baloumat could be the hero of the Battle of Jeuno! Adorned with shiny, shiny medals!${prompt}
  8455: Hmmm...${prompt}
  8456: Seems like a meeting is in order. Time for a discussion.${prompt}
  8457: All caits, assemble! Gather 'round!${prompt}
  8458: “The Battle of Jeuno” of which the girl speaks...${prompt}
  8459: Is the battle which proves to be the turning point in the Crystal War, is it not? The pivotal moment?${prompt}
  8460: A curious possibility. Positively curious.${prompt}
  8461: |-
    Can she be trusted? Her words hold truth?
    Could they be...the Champions of the Dawn?${prompt}
  8462: Perhaps we should assist them. Lend a helping hand.${prompt}
  8463: |-
    Nyahahahaha!
    The lot of you, so easily fooled. Quick to take the bait.
    Give me one reason why we should trust that girl.${prompt}
  8464: |-
    I'm of the same opinion.
    Make scratching posts out of them, I say. A little stress relief.${prompt}
  8465: |-
    Now, now, Coig. Violence is the first resort of the incompetent.
    No harm in hearing them out. Let them have a say.${prompt}
  8466: Yes, yes, let them tell us about that underwear fellow. Lingerie.${prompt}
  8467: That's Ragelise, Naoi. Ra-ge-lise.${prompt}
  8468: |-
    Ah, yes, an unusual name.
    Should this Ragelise be a playing piece on our side of the board, it would be a shame not to exploit him. A wasted resource.${prompt}
  8469: |-
    Hmmm...
    A befuddling dilemma of sorts. A sort of dilemma.${prompt}
  8470: Hey, aren't you finished yet!?${prompt}
  8471: |-
    Silence, impatient one!
    Distract us not from our discussion. Discussing a distraction.${prompt}
  8472: |-
    Hmph, very well, then.
    Let me know as soon as your little meeting's over, you hear?${prompt}
  8473: The mission's fulfillment, none need be reminded, is our utmost priority. Must stay the course.${prompt}
  8474: So long as it serves to succor the children of Altana...${prompt}
  8475: |-
    Hmm...all valid arguments.
    Let's settle the matter with a vote. Settle once and for all.${prompt}
  8476: All those in favor of lending a hand to the girl and Ragie?${prompt}
  8477: |-
    One, two, three, four...
    Thank you kindly.${prompt}
  8478: And those in favor of minding our own business?${prompt}
  8479: One, two, three, four...${prompt}
  8480: Errr...oh?${prompt}
  8481: |-
    Silly, silly Naoi!
    You've gone and forgotten to vote! Didn't raise your hand!${prompt}
  8482: Oh? Didn't I?${prompt}
  8483: |-
    Enough, enough!
    All this bickering will avail us naught.${prompt}
  8484: I've a thought. Tell them, we should, of the thing that can be got from the lake yonder, and then move on. Be on our merry way.${prompt}
  8485: |-
    Ah, a grand idea!
    We wise them up to its existence. Let them know.${prompt}
  8486: '...But, what''s the “thing”?${prompt}'
  8487: |-
    Suffering from old age-induced forgetfulness, are we? Going grey about the ears?
    The “thing” is none other than the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} that can be found by the lakeside here. Makes a good medicine, it does.${prompt}
  8488: Impressive! I'll be sure to keep that in mind!${prompt}
  8489: |-
    Yes, yes, save the knowledge for a rainy day.
    We tell the girl where it can be obtained, and the rest is entirely up to her. Her entirely.
    And, oh...?${prompt}
  8490: Don't mind me, folks. Carry on.${prompt}
  8491: " \n  Nyaaaaaah!?"
  8492: Awww, don't run away! Wait!
  8493: Gyaaaaaah!
  8494: Let go, you big brute! Unhand me!${prompt}
  8495: <Slurp> Wh-what was that!?${prompt}
  8496: Easy, now. I may not look it, but I'm actually an avid cat enthusiast. Honest!${prompt}
  8497: N-no...stop it...don't you dare...${prompt}
  8498: It-it's him!${prompt}
  8499: |-
    Awww, such adorable little creatures...
    Makes it all the harder to dispose of you all as Haudrale commanded.${prompt}
  8500: Tell you what. Promise to become my loyal pet in place of Galarhigg, and I'll let you live.${prompt}
  8501: What say you, hm? Have we a deal?${prompt}
  8502: I...I...${prompt}
  8503: I'd rather choke to death on my own fur ball!
  8504: |-
    <Sigh>...
    That was the heartbreaking reply I so wanted not to hear.
  8505: Aaah! How could they have known of this location!? Been made aware!?${prompt}
  8506: Naoi, you mustn't! You'll only fall into his hands as well!${prompt}
  8507: Ochd! Dha! Noooooo!${prompt}
  8508: Awww...the others managed to escape. Haudrale is going to throw a monstrous fit when he learns of this.${prompt}
  8509: Wh-what he just did to those cats...${prompt}
  8510: But, why?${prompt}
  8511: Aren't they supposed to be in league with each other?${prompt}
  8512: Hmm? You two...${prompt}
  8513: You're the ones who tormented my Galarhigg, aren't you? Don't even think to deny it.${prompt}
  8514: Y-you're one to talk! Father had to live out his days in agonizing pain because of what you did!${prompt}
  8515: '...${prompt}'
  8516: Poor Galarhigg...${prompt}
  8517: |-
    People who mistreat innocent creatures...
    People like you...
  8518: Must be made to pay!!!
  8519: ${name-player}, be at the ready!${prompt}
  8520: '...!'
  8521: Y-yes, Haudrale?${prompt}
  8522: Sorry, sorry. I had a few unanticipated problems fall plop into my lap, but everything's sorted now. I'll be reporting back soon.${prompt}
  8523: I won't be bringing any stray kittens back with me, if that's what you're thinking. The felines have been tended to, as you ordered.${prompt}
  8524: (Well, just two of them, to be exact...)${prompt}
  8525: Hmph... Looks like you get to live to see another sunrise.${prompt}
  8526: I must say, you two are a curious pair. What is it that you hope to gain, taking the crazed mewlings of those cats to heart?${prompt}
  8527: But you're free to do as you please, of course. Be seeing you!${prompt}
  8528: '...Just what is he, exactly?${prompt}'
  8529: |-
    Never mind that for now.

  8700: |-
    Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.
    This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt}
  8701: Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt}
  8702: A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt}
  8703: Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt}
  8704: |-
    Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.
    Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt}
  8705: Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt}
  8706: Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt}
  8707: However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt}
  8708: |-
    When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.
    These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt}
  8709: Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt}
  8710: The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt}
  8711: |-
    Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.
    Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt}
  8712: As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt}
  8713: Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt}
  8714: Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt}
  8715: After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt}
  8716: Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt}
  8717: Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  8718: While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  8719: Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt}
  8720: Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt}
  8721: Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt}
  8722: Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt}
  8723: Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt}
  8724: The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt}
  8725: The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt}
  8726: Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt}
  8727: 'Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt}'
  8728: |-
    Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts.
    By infusing atmacite to one's body using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.${prompt}
  8729: Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}
  8730: Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.${prompt}
  8731: Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.${prompt}
  8732: As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.${prompt}
  8733: Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.${prompt}
  8734: 'Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level ${number: 0}.${prompt}'
  8735: All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.${prompt}
  8736: Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt}
  8737: Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.${prompt}
  8738: Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.${prompt}
