    All inter-dimensional travelers such as yourself must acquire visitant status in order to journey within Abyssea.
    To be granted this status, you must provide me with ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  7257: |-
    Having come from a different plane of existence, your existential phase is unaligned to that of Abyssea.
    To overcome this problem, ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} is required. It acts as a stabilizing agent that aligns and anchors your essence to Abyssea for prolonged periods of time.${prompt}
  7258: |-
    Bereft of its effect, your essence will become unraveled within a matter of minutes, after which you will be expelled to your own reality.
    Do make a habit of first coming to me upon arrival in Abyssea.${prompt}
  7259: A word of warning. As the presence of unaligned entities may have adverse effects on this dimension, only those with visitant status are permitted to venture beyond the searing ward.${prompt}
  7260: |-
    Those without visitant status will be forcibly returned to the searing ward's vicinity.
    This is a preventative measure against the detrimental effects of inter-dimensional “noise.”${prompt}
  7261: |-
    When requesting visitant status, please indicate the number of ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} you wish to process.
    A greater number will allow you a longer stay.${prompt}
  7262: 'It is also possible to extend your visitant status by bringing me more ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  7263: 'To obtain ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}, you must seek out Joachim. He is currently a resident of your world, Vana''diel.${prompt}'
  7264: Lastly, I will explain in detail the myriad effects granted by the visitant status.${prompt}
  7265: Many are the reports of positive things occurring while under its auspices, from a general upturn in fortunes to more specific benefits such as accelerated growth and greater ease of cruor harvesting.${prompt}
  7266: |-
    Naturally, these benefits will not come to the idle.
    The gains have been observed to grow proportionately to one's exploits in Abyssea.${prompt}
  7267: |-
    All good things come to an end, however, and this is no exception.
    The effects endure as long as you remain in Abyssea, but will wear off at the instant of your departure.${prompt}
  7268: |-
    That concludes my explanation of the visitant status.

    Greetings, traveler. I am a resistance officer whose charge is the procurement of cruor.

  7283: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that cruor is the lifeblood of the resistance effort.
    As a matter of fact, the bulk of items I have in stock are cruor-based.${prompt}

    The most popular varieties offer extended visitant status time, accelerated growth, and myriad enhancement effects.
    Some are even said to improve luck, but such benefits can be troublesome to measure.${prompt}

    The abundant power that it imbues when infused into our bodies is not in question.
    The perilous means by which it must be acquired, however, leaves something to be desired.${prompt}
  7373: |-
    After all, bolstering the strength of one man means little if ten others must lose their lives in the process.
    Thus was the impetus behind our research: to discover a means for extracting atma from resources at our immediate disposal.${prompt}
  7374: |-
    We experimented with nearly every substance in sight--be it animal, vegetable, or mineral.
    Yet each time, the atma produced was small, fragile, and entirely absent of the power we sought.${prompt}
  7375: |-
    Then, one day, we hit upon the obvious answer that we had so long overlooked...ourselves.
    Yes, the atma extracted from our own bodies--particularly those richly possessed of experiences and memories--these housed a power rivalling that harvested from the most vicious of fiends.${prompt}
  7376: If you possess such memories, then I can bring forth the latent power that resides within you as well.${prompt}
  7377: |-
    Fear not, for there is everything to gain and nothing to lose.
    Save for some cruor, that is...${prompt}
  7378: |-
    Curious, is it not?
    That potent physical energy can be extracted from such a tenuous, intangible thing...${prompt}
  7379: |-
    But the strength our memories and experiences give us is real, if all too easily overlooked.
    Once isolated, it is simply a matter of recalling it, solidifying it, and bringing it to the fore.${prompt}
  7380: |-
    Surely you understand of what it is I speak, yes?
    Your greatest accomplishments--those that make others stand in wonderment and admiration when you they hear your name.${prompt}
  7381: |-
    We summon forth the energies from the deepest recesses of your psyche, and infuse it into the cruor you carry.
    The resultant agglomeration of organic mineral and soul energy is synthetic atma.${prompt}
  7382: |-
    Mind you, the deeper and more puissant your energies, the more cruor will be necessary to contain it all.
    If you wish to have me assay the powers that lie dormant within you, simply speak the word.${prompt}
  7383: |-
    Very well. We shall see what latent powers you possess.
    Stand still and clear your mind...${prompt}

  7685: The pulse martello, the cornerstone of the resistance effort, is stationed here at this outpost.${prompt}
  7686: Its operation requires “martello cores,” the type and quantity of which determines the potency of the aid it lends to our activities.${prompt}
  7687: |-
    The Abyssean hordes, however, somehow learned of the pulse martello's inner workings, and have taken to targeting the outpost.
    On more than a few occasions, they have broken through our defenses and made off with cores.${prompt}
  7688: We've rallied our forces and retrieved some of the stolen cores, but doing so has been observed to infuriate the enemy.${prompt}
  7689: Through the course of our encounters with the fiends, we've attained a better understanding of their behavioral patterns.${prompt}
  7690: First of all, a more powerful pulse martello incurs the ire of the creatures, provoking them to come at us in force.${prompt}
  7691: Secondly, the greater sway we hold over the area, the more frequently the enemy will attack.${prompt}
  7692: The Abyssean hordes are determined not to allow us a foothold in the struggle. Actions that forward our cause in any capacity, such as slaying them in great numbers and bolstering the resistance effort, are surefire ways to gain their attention.${prompt}
  7693: Lastly, enemy forces will emerge and surge towards the outpost from one of three locations, each called a “verge.”${prompt}
  7694: The timing at which they will next appear from a certain verge is ever-changing, so we must remain on constant alert.${prompt}
  7695: Armed with this intel, we're constantly buttressing ourselves against future enemy attacks.${prompt}
  7696: |-
    Experience has taught us much about when to expect the Abyssean hordes, and in what numbers.
    If you wish to know this information, simply ask me.${prompt}
  7697: The pulse martello, stationed a short distance from here, was developed to serve as the bastion for area-wide resistance efforts.${prompt}
  7698: It sustains our activities in myriad ways, such as amplifying support effects and lessening the burden borne by veridical confluxes.${prompt}
  7699: By installing increasingly potent cores, and in greater numbers, we can boost the martello's power output, thus further enhancing its benefits.${prompt}
  7700: As you can see, the pulse martello is instrumental in our struggle for survival.${prompt}
  7701: Which makes it doubly unfortunate that it isn't more durable; the fiends can break through to steal its cores all too easily.${prompt}
  7702: |-
    Stolen cores can be retrieved by slaying the enemy.
    In so doing, however, we incur their ire, and they will later come back at us with greater strength.${prompt}
  7703: |-
    A more powerful pulse martello will also draw the enemy's attention.
    It is believed that the fiends can sense the energy waves being emitted, even if they do not derive the benefits as we do.${prompt}
  7704: |-
    As such, any upgrades performed to the purlse martello must be accompanied with the shoring up of our defenses.
    The type and number of cores installed are a fairly accurate indicator of what the enemy will throw at us. If you wish to know these details, simply ask me.${prompt}
  7705: When the enemy attacks, we can never have too many sword arms to help us defend the outpost.${prompt}
  7706: |-
    However, that isn't the only area in which we require assistance.
    During lulls in the fighting, you can participate in various resistance operations to help us consolidate our defenses.${prompt}
  7707: Whichever way you choose to assist us, you will be rewarded in Resistance Credits, the amount of which is determined through an evaluation.${prompt}
  7708: Resistance Credits, in particular, can be traded to me in exchange for rare and useful items.${prompt}
  7709: Should you wish to help us defend the outpost, speak with me and I will issue you with a Pennant.${prompt}
  7710: |-
    A Pennant identifies you as having received official clearance to participate in the outpost's defense.
    Without it, you will not receive any recompense for your contributions. Be sure to keep this in mind.${prompt}
  7711: As the performance evaluation is carried out on a per-enemy basis, it is permissible to return the Pennant at any time.${prompt}
  7712: The Pennant will automatically disappear upon the conclusion of battle, but you may choose to return it before then simply by speaking to me.${prompt}
  7713: If you wish to undertake resistance operations, the resistance sapper will be pleased to assist.${prompt}
  7714: Our survival rests upon your cooperation. I beseech you to do your part.${prompt}

    Ask something?
    ${selection-lines}
    So, what's a martello?
    Martello replenishment.
    Martello upgrades.
    Cautionary notes.
    Not now.${prompt}
  7827: |-
    The device we know as the martello was first developed by military engineers many years past, during an age of great war.
    Martellos serve to keep combatants fighting fit, healing their wounds and restoring their mental energies.${prompt}
  7828: You will observe that martellos have been constructed in numerous locales, so as to provide strategically located safe havens for harried resistance fighters. No doubt you will find yourself making use of them as well.${prompt}
  7829: In the bowels of each martello is contained a tank designed to hold martello fuel.${prompt}
  7830: |-
    This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is the lifeblood of the martello, and the source of its curative powers.
    Depleted stores will render the device little more than an oversized parchmentweight.${prompt}
  7831: That being the case, we're in continual need of volunteers willing to take on the vital task of replenishing these martellos.${prompt}
  7832: |-
    I have been charged with overseeing a supply of martello fuel.
    Should you be willing to take part in a replenishment run, you need only say the word.
    Needless to say, you will not go unrewarded for your efforts.${prompt}
  7833: |-
    Feast your eyes on this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. She's a beauty, isn't she?
    Installing one of these into a martello will increase its fuel capacity.${prompt}
  7834: |-
    An upgraded martello will be able to sustain its energy stores for a longer time between replenishment operations.
    Needless to say, this is a blessing and a half to those on the battlefield.${prompt}
  7835: |-
    Unfortunately, the installation procedure is quite complex.
    As such, we can only entrust it to experienced hands.${prompt}

    You there! I've not seen your face before.
    Are you another surrrvivor from the airship?${prompt}
  8017: |-
    What airship!? Hoo boy, you must have hit your head hard in that crash.
    Why, nearly all of us in the chasm are survivors from the airship wrrreck.${prompt}
  8018: |-
    We lifted off from Jeuno just as the hordes were breaching the city walls.
    Thought we were home frrree, we did, until we came under attack by a veritable storm of ghastly flying fiends.${prompt}
  8019: |-
    We quickly lost prrropulsion and plummeted to the bottom of the chasm.
    It was only by a stroke of fortune that the majority of us survived.${prompt}
  8020: |-
    A few members of the Ducal Guard who were on board with us sprrrung into action and led us up here.
    I'm grrrateful, of course, even if our situation is little better than it was.${prompt}
  8021: |-
    ...But of course, none of this is ringing a bell for you, because you weren't on that ship, were you?
    Look, I don't know how you've managed to survive out there on your own, but it's clear you're tough as hell and we could really use the help of someone like you.${prompt}
  8022: There's another camp here in the chasm, where our most able-bodied survivors are locked in a strrruggle to keep the hordes at bay.${prompt}
  8023: |-
    We've only just met, but I think you'd be a great asset to their cause.
    What do you say?${prompt}
  8024: |-
    Join the resistance effort?
    ${selection-lines}
    Resistance effort?
    Count me in!
    Thanks, but no thanks.${prompt}
  8025: |-
    I suppose I should explain. Attohwa has been overrun by an army of truly fearsome creations, you see.
    Made of metal, they show almost no signs of sentience, yet they attack us with a vengeance.${prompt}
  8026: |-
    What's more, there's something coldly calculating about their attack patterns.
    Why, it's as if they've even grrrasped the importance of the pulse martello!${prompt}
  8027: |-
    ...But I digress.
    Surely, you can see our plight? The fight for survival requires every able man and woman to take up arms...${prompt}
  8028: |-
    Most vital of all is the defense of the pulse martello and the clone wards.
    Why, if they were to fall, it'd be currrtains for all of us...!${prompt}
  8029: |-
    ...Sorry, I've gotten ahead of myself again.
    If you're willing to join our cause, make your way to the outpost and speak to the prefect there.
    You'll get a far more detailed briefing on the situation than I could hope to give you.${prompt}
  8030: |-
    Forgive me.
    I should not have presumed upon a strrranger to take an interest in our plight...${prompt}
  8031: |-
    Thank you everrr so much!
    With you on our side, we might just stand a chance against those diabolical things!${prompt}
  8032: |-
    ...Ah!
    I don't mean to impose, but if you're heading for the outpost anyway, perhaps you could help us out with another small task.${prompt}
  8033: To make a long story short, a rrregiment charged with delivering a shipment of essential supplies to the outpost was ambushed not far from here.${prompt}
  8034: |-
    Our comrades lost their lives and the supplies were scattered across the chasm.
    It'd be a great help if you could rrrecover and deliver them to their intended destination.${prompt}
  8035: |-
    Oh, grrracious no. You don't need to track down all of them.
    Let's see... Yes, I believe ${number: 0} or so would be sufficient to keep the outpost rrrunning for the time being.${prompt}
  8036: |-
    You can deliver them to Morlepiche, a former Ducal Guardsman now serving as an officer in the Resistance.
    He will be most grrrateful for your help, I'm sure.${prompt}
  8037: |-
    I feel I've forgotten something important...oh yes!
    To reach the outpost, you'll want to travel northwest from here, past the searing ward.
    The path is winding and trrreacherous, with fiends lurking around every bend. Take care, you hear?${prompt}
  8038: |-
    ...Five, six. Curses! Is this all that remains!?
    If those supplies don't arrive soon, we're as good as done for!${prompt}
  8039: What is this? Do my eyes deceive me!?${prompt}
  8040: |-
    Our supplies! I thought for sure we had lost them for good.
    You have no idea what this means to us, friend.${prompt}
  8041: |-
    Still, this will not sustain us forever.
    If you encounter any more of the waylaid supplies, promise that you will deliver them here to me.${prompt}
  8042: |-
    ...Yes, this should be all of them.
    Excellent! This should keep this outpost in good trim for the foreseeable future.${prompt}
  8043: |-
    What's that you say?
    You've heard we were looking for a few good ${choice-player-gender}[men/women]?${prompt}
  8044: |-
    Ahaha! For a labyrinth of crags and craters, word certainly travels fast in this chasm.
    Of course, we'd be honored to welcome you to our ranks.${prompt}
  8045: |-
    Currently, our most pressing need is in maintaining our defenses against the hordes.
    Speak with the resistance sapper over there to learn how you can do your part.${prompt}
  8046: |-
    I, for one, have no intention of laying down my life in this barren wasteland.
    No, there are too many people depending on me, too many things I still must accomplish...${prompt}
  8047: |-
    Surely it is the same for you, friend?
    That is why we must band together, and drive back the fiends at all costs!${prompt}
  8048: Nearly everyone you'll encounter in the chasm--civilian and soldier alike--is a surrrvivor from the fallen airship.${prompt}
  8049: |-
    ...Though come to think of it, you're neitherrr. Wherever did you...?
    Ah, it matters not. What matters is that you're on our side now!${prompt}
  8050: |-
    ...Understood.
    You must redouble your efforts, and...${prompt}
  8051: She appears to be communicating with someone...
  8052: |-
    Yes? What is it?
    If I've told you once, I've told you a hundred times. Don't bother me when I'm--${prompt}
  8053: |-
    ...Wait. Your face is unfamiliar to me.
    Don't tell me you've travelled here from outside the camp?${prompt}
  8054: This is a surprise indeed...${prompt}
  8055: |-
    Wait a moment.
    If you are truly from the outside, then perhaps you are familiar with Parradamo Tor.${prompt}
  8056: |-
    'Tis a towering crag located in the middle of the chasm, and an ideal spot from which to survey the surrounding area.
    In fact, we've a plan to establish a new outpost atop this highly strategic location.${prompt}
  8057: To this end, I dispatched a scouting regiment there not long ago...a scouting regiment that gone far too long now without reporting back to me.${prompt}
  8058: |-
    Curse those bunglers! And I had figured them for my most capable men!
    Though given how thin our ranks are these days, I suppose that's not saying much.${prompt}
  8059: You, however, must be quite the seasoned pro to have survived a trek through the wastes. In fact...${prompt}
  8060: |-
    Perhaps you could travel to the tor and help me reestablish contact with my men.
    I have these linkpearls and emergency rations, should they prove necessary. What do you say?${prompt}
  8061: |-
    Accept the assignment?
    ${selection-lines}
    You can count on me!
    Not sure I'm up for it...${prompt}
  8062: |-
    Nonsense! A ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] with your survival skills is as capable as anyone in our ranks!
    I beg of you, you must do this for us!${prompt}
  8063: Thank you. The entire resistance effort is greatly in your debt.${prompt}
  8064: |-
    My suspicion is that they've become separated from each other.
    <Sigh>... How many times did I tell the fools to stay in each other's sight?${prompt}
  8065: At any rate, we're counting on you!${prompt}
  8066: |-
    Thanks to your efforts, we've restored contact with the entire scouting regiment.
    Much as I suspected, their abilities left something to be desired.${prompt}
  8067: |-
    ${choice: 0}[Nevertheless, we/We] must make do with the personnel at hand.
    It would go far if they could report back even once a day. Is that so much to ask?${prompt}
  8068: |-
    Forgive me. I should not lower myself to grousing.
    Take this for your troubles. You've done the Resistance a great service today!${prompt}
  8069: |-
    Hail again, friend.
    I'm not quite sure how to say this, but it would seem my hapless scouts have once more gone astray.${prompt}
  8070: |-
    Loath as I am to burden you yet again, I would be greatly in your debt if you could track them down and deliver these supplies.
    If not for me, then for the welfare of all the survivors!${prompt}
  8071: |-
    Well, this here's a sight.
    Don't get many travelers out this way, y'see.${prompt}
  8072: |-
    This is Parradamo Tor. You'd best watch your step around here.
    It's quite a ways down, as surely ye can see.${prompt}
  8073: |-
    Oh, curse and criminy!
    So close to my destination, and this damnable smoke obscures my path!${prompt}
  8074: I was serving as the rearguard of our regiment--a most important duty, I assure you!${prompt}
  8075: |-
    And serving admirably I was, until this accursed smoke appeared before me, separating me from my comrades to the fore.
    Come to think of it, why have they not returned to search for me...?${prompt}
  8076: |-
    Ah, pardon me, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/missus].
    Would you happen-wappen to know where we are?${prompt}
  8077: I say, there are so many crags and crevices in this chasm that you can't tell one from the nextaru!${prompt}
  8078: |-
    Are you heading-weading to the top, perhaps?
    Why, I think I might just do the same!${prompt}
  8079: |-
    Ho there. Whatever brings you to such a desolate place?
    Had I not been recruited for a scouting mission, I'd be as far away from here as possible.${prompt}
  8080: |-
    On top of that, I seem to have been separated from my companions.
    They must be around here somewhere...${prompt}
  8081: |-
    I'm sorry, but this is hardly the time for idle chitchat.
    If you know what's good for you, you'll head back to camp before you get lost too.${prompt}
  8082: |-
    Now where could the others have wanderrred off to?
    Hello! Hello～o!!!${prompt}
  8083: |-
    To think I not only dropped my linkpearl, but then swiftly proceeded to step on it too!
    I told them I wasn't cut out for this kind of worrrk...${prompt}
  8084: If you come across any o' the other scouts, I'd be much obliged if you could dirrrect them this way.${prompt}
  8085: |-
    Well, this here's a sight.
    Don't get many travelers out--${prompt}
  8086: What's that y' have with ye? Rations, and a linkpearl to boot!?${prompt}
  8087: |-
    Can't thank ye enough, friend.
    When I lost contact with the camp, I thought I was done for.${prompt}
  8088: Ye take care of yerself, now.${prompt}
  8089: |-
    Are mine eyes to be believed? Are those rations you carry!?
    And a new linkpearl! Oh, joyous day!${prompt}
  8090: |-
    My own accursed pearl seems only to work in one direction.
    I receive transmissions from camp, but try as I might, my voice falls on deaf ears.${prompt}
  8091: Nor have I heard from my fellow scouts recently... I do hope they've not met an untimely demise.${prompt}
  8092: |-
    Rations! Just when my tummy was starting to rumble-wumble.
    Remarkable timing, I must declare!${prompt}
  8093: |-
    You wouldn't happen to have a sip of drink as well?
    A cup of Windurstian tea, perhaps? 'Cause I'm positively dying of thirstaru!${prompt}
  8094: A new linkpearl? Come to think of it, it's been a while since I heard anything from this one.${prompt}
  8095: |-
    At any rate, thanks to you, I'm good to go.
    Now, last one to the summit is a rotten chocobo egg! Ta-taru!${prompt}
  8096: |-
    Oh, a new linkpearl, and a rather exquisite one at that.
    Now I can reconnect with my fellow scouts in style.${prompt}
  8097: Speaking of which, wherever could they have disappeared to?${prompt}
  8098: |-
    You think they'd drop everything once they realized the most attractive member of the team was missing.
    Didn't anyone ever teach them how to treat a lady?${prompt}
  8099: A fresh new linkpearrrl! Is this for me?${prompt}
  8100: |-
    Oh, thank you everrr so much!
    I was gettin' mighty lonely out here all by myself...${prompt}
  8101: The chocobos y' see here are what few survived the attack on Jeuno.${prompt}
  8102: |-
    A cryin' shame, it is, t' think of all the noble birds who lost their lives that day...
    It's all I can do t' do right by those that remain...${prompt}
  8103: |-
    You there. You strike me as one who appreciates our fine feathered friends.
    Am I right? Either way, hear me out.${prompt}
  8104: |-
    We've got ourselves a stray chocobo on our hands, y'see.
    Jus' a short while ago, another one of those blasted tremors struck, and when I came back here, sure enough one o' our birds'd gone missin'.${prompt}
  8105: I feel for the poor things, I tell ya.${prompt}
  8106: |-
    You could scour the world and not find a stouter-hearted bird than the chocobo.
    But with earthquakes and landslides and god-awful creatures burstin' forth from each and every crack and crevasse, it's enough to send even the bravest animal into a right panic.${prompt}
  8107: |-
    It pains me to think of the poor creature out there, alone and defenseless.
    And yet, I must stay here and look after the rest o' the flock. Blast it all!${prompt}
  8108: |-
    Offer your aid?
    ${selection-lines}
    Certainly!
    I think not...${prompt}
  8109: |-
    The poor lil' critter...
    I can only hope he survives on his own...${prompt}
  8110: I knew it! Struck me from the start as a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] o' compassion, ya did.${prompt}
  8111: |-
    Now listen up. I don't know what you know about chocobos, but if I can tell ya one thing, they ain't easy to catch.
    And these days, they're even more skittish than ever.${prompt}
  8112: |-
    First you'll have to lure him out o' wherever he's hiding.
    If you spot his tracks, just set down ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and he should pop his head out b'fore long.${prompt}
  8113: |-
    Now here's what separates a wrangler from a stable ${choice-player-gender}[boy/girl].
    A panicking chocobo can scarce tell th' difference b'tween friend and foe, and'll run from the sight of most anything.${prompt}
  8114: |-
    So you'll be wantin' to sneak up from behind, all stealthy-like.
    Get close enough, and...grab 'im while he's none the wiser!${prompt}
  8115: It's a right hassle to do on yer own, so I'd recommend bringin' along a friend or two.${prompt}
  8116: |-
    That should be all ya need to know.
    Now hurry! The little critter's countin' on you!${prompt}
  8117: |-
    Well, will ya look at this? Back safe and sound!
    Brings a tear to this stableman's eye, I tell ya.${prompt}
  8118: |-
    This ain't much in comparison to th' life of a noble bird, but I want ya to have it.
    From one bird lover to another.${prompt}
  8119: |-
    The bird ya brought back is doin' just fine.
    He's still a bit skittish, o' course, but there's nary a scratch on him.
    A true friend to these animals, you are.${prompt}
  8120: |-
    Oh, it's you again. 'fraid I've got some bad news.
    Seems another one of my birds has flown the coop...${prompt}
  8121: I'd be greatly obliged if you could bring the critter back like ya did before.${prompt}
  8122: |-
    Standing over the prints, you catch a whiff of the scent of wet feathers.
    The chocobo cannot be far off...${prompt}
  8123: |-
    You placed ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} atop the prints.
    You'd best observe from a distance...${prompt}
  8124: There is not a chocobo in sight...${prompt}
  8125: Kweh!?${prompt}
  8126: Kweh! Kweh! Kweeeeeeh!!!${prompt}
  8127: Kweeeh! Kweeeh!!!${prompt}
  8128: '...${prompt}'
  8129: You've caught yourself a chocobo!${prompt}
  8130: |-
    Why, hello. Could you lend me your ear for a moment?
    Oh, pretty pretty please?${prompt}
  8131: I'm trying to do something for all the brave soldiers who protectaru us night and day...though I guess you can't really call it “day,” huh?${prompt}
  8132: |-
    Anyhow, I mean to patch up their garments! Isn't that sweet of me?
    But I seem to have hit an unfortunate snag, as I lack for the very-wery materials this task requires...${prompt}
  8133: |-
    Fortunately, I have my sightarus set on a suitable replacement.
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}! Yes, my keen clothcrafter's sense tells me that these will most certainly-wertainly do the trick.${prompt}
  8134: |-
    I would be ever so grateful if you could bring me ${number: 1} of these ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.
    I'll even give you a positively delightful treat for your efforts.${prompt}
  8135: |-
    Oh, they're absolutely beautiful! I can't thank you enough!
    If you ever happen-wappen to come across ${number: 1} more ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}, I would be forever grateful if you could bring them to me.${prompt}
  8136: |-
    I used to care about cute and stylish designs above all else.
    But in these bleak times, I can'taru afford to worry about luxuries.${prompt}
  8137: |-
    I must make the most I can out of limited supplies.
    Yes, even a humble-wumble clothcrafter must do what she can to serve the Resistance.${prompt}
  8138: |-
    What am I doing here, you ask?
    I could ask you the same. Now get lost, stranger.${prompt}
  8139: |-
    Hmmmmmm... Yes, there's no mistaking it.
    You're ${name-player}, aren't you?${prompt}
  8140: |-
    How do I know your name? That's classified information.
    What's important is, I'm looking to make a transaction. For ${item-plural: 0[2]}, to be precise.${prompt}
  8141: |-
    “What do you need them for?” That's classified information, too.
    You're a nosy one, aren't you?${prompt}
  8142: Let's just say that they have a certain...value...to me and the people I work for.${prompt}
  8143: |-
    What I'm sayin' is, they're worth more to us than they could ever be to you.
    And that's all you need to know.${prompt}
  8144: Now let's get back to business.${prompt}
  8145: 'Our intelligence reports say that ${item-plural: 0[2]} can be found inside the pyxides.${prompt}'
  8146: You know, those treasure caskets that you'll find being guarded by Abyssean fiends.${prompt}
  8147: |-
    Or sometimes you'll even find them just lying around.
    Ever wondered why that is? Well, I can't tell you...it's classified information.${prompt}
  8148: 'Track down one of those ${item-plural: 0[2]} and bring it back to me, and I''ll hook you up with some of our finest wares.${prompt}'
  8149: |-
    Let's see that. Hmm, yes, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, there's no mistaking it.
    Looks like we have a deal.${prompt}
  8150: |-
    As you can see, doing business with me is well worth your while.
    If you come across any more ${item-plural: 0[2]}, you know where to bring them.${prompt}
  8151: Have you spoken with the survivors here, by any chance-ethy?${prompt}
  8152: |-
    If so, you've probably observed that they suffer-ethy from some most curious symptoms.
    At first I thought it was simply the stress of this harsh lifestyle that we are all forced to live-ethy...${prompt}
  8153: |-
    ...Yet somehow it seems to be more complex than that.
    We are fortunate indeed-ethy to have a physician from Jeuno among our ranks, but there is only so much one man can do--however talented-ethy he may be.${prompt}
  8154: |-
    And so I have been researching the cause-ethy of this plague.
    Would you care-ethy to hear my hypothesis?${prompt}
  8155: |-
    I have considered all the possibility-ethies, and one stands out as the most likely.
    I believe that the very air we breathe-ethy has been contaminated!${prompt}
  8156: |-
    It is the only explanation for a plague of this scale-ethy and proportion!
    And yet, there remains one hole in my theory...${prompt}

    I have yet to identify the source-ethy of the contaminant.
    Without this knowledge, there is precious little-ethy that I can do for our people.${prompt}
  8158: Fortunately, I have just come upon-ethy a most promising discovery!${prompt}
  8159: |-
    By speaking extensively with the patients, I have learned-ethy that many of them began experiencing their symptoms on the same day.
    A day when the wind gust-ethied in from the west...${prompt}
  8160: Surely you can understand-ethy the implications!${prompt}
  8161: Yes-ethy! Something to the west of here is spewing vile poison-ethy into the air!${prompt}
  8162: I know not-ethy if it is a fiend or some other foul thing, but whatever it is, we must put an end-ethy to it before any more lives are claimed-ethy!${prompt}
  8163: |-
    Oh, dear-ethy me. I seem to have gotten a bit carried away.
    Do you follow me so far?${prompt}
  8164: |-
    Got it?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yep-ethy.
    Not exactly-ethy.${prompt}
  8165: Excellent. Then let's get down-ethy to brass tacks.${prompt}
  8166: <Sigh>... And here I took care to explain-ethy it as clearly and concisely as possible.${prompt}
  8167: |-
    The heart of the matter is thus: you must go west-ethy, young ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman], and investigate the source of the contamination.
    No, not merely investigate...we need-ethy concrete scientific evidence-ethy!${prompt}
  8168: |-
    Take heart-ethy! If you can follow-ethy my ramblings this far, you can do anything!
    For the sake of all the survivors who suffer, you must-ethy!${prompt}
  8169: Before you blooms a large flower, its vivid markings identifying it as clearly poisonous.${prompt}
  8170: Something falls to the ground beside your feet...${prompt}
  8171: |-
    You're back!
    Well? What did you find-ethy?${prompt}
  8172: Why, this is...!${prompt}
  8173: |-
    Are you out of your mind-ethy!?
    Do you realize how poisonous that is? Who asked you to bring-ethy such a dangerous thing back here, anyway!?${prompt}
  8174: |-
    Er, I suppose-ethy I did, didn't I?
    Anyhow, we must seal it up before its fumes contaminate the whole cave-ethy!${prompt}
  8175: |-
    ...Yes. This is indubitably-ethy the cause of the poison.
    And with this prime specimen you've brought me, I have the utmost confidence in my ability to develop-ethy a cure.${prompt}
  8176: |-
    You have my thanks.
    Take this-ethy for your troubles!${prompt}
  8177: |-
    I will find a cure-ethy!
    I shall! I must-ethy!${prompt}
  8178: |-
    <Sniff>... Ahhh-choo!!!
    Aye yai yai! The fumes! I must be more careful-ethy!${prompt}
  8179: What remarkable timing!${prompt}
  8180: 'Would you believe-ethy that I just completed my analysis of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} you acquired for me?${prompt}'
  8181: I have some bad news-ethy and some good news-ethy.${prompt}
  8182: The bad-ethy is that the poison is far too potent to be neutralized directly; no doubt the bizarre changes in the environment have caused the gasponia to mutate and grow in strength.${prompt}
  8183: |-
    The good news-ethy is that I've already formulated a backup plan.
    Whoever said that this former minister was past his prime-ethy!?${prompt}
  8184: |-
    By introducing a counteragent directly into the source--the gasponia itself--I believe we can trigger-ethy a reverse mutation.
    If successful, its noxious fumes will abate-ethy, and its poison turn benign!${prompt}
  8185: |-
    As a scientist, I would not normally approve-ethy of tampering with our natural environment...
    But this time, lives are at stake-ethy!${prompt}
  8186: |-
    There is, however, one rub-ethy.
    I lack for the key ingredient to concoct the counteragent.${prompt}
  8187: '${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 1[2]}... They''re said to be found-ethy here in the chasm, but where-ethy?${prompt}'
  8188: |-
    Sad-ethy to say, my research affords me little time for exploration.
    My knowledge of the local terrain is pitifully lacking.${prompt}
  8189: There must be someone in the area-ethy who could enlighten us...but who-ethy?${prompt}
  8190: |-
    It was a terrible day, when the skies turned red...
    I should never have gotten out of...er, woken up?
    Er, I seem to have misspoken. Anyhow...${prompt}
  8191: |-
    My mastery of disguises has proven quite the blessing.
    For you see, I've been able to keep the fiends gue--er, from finding me.
    No, that's not what I meant...${prompt}
  8192: |-
    At any rate, I suggest you steer clear of Parradamo Tor.
    Fearsome fiends lurk there, and much, much...er, some other not-so-good things.
    <Grumble>... Why can't I think straight these days?${prompt}
  8193: |-
    You search for ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you say?
    Why yes, I saw one just the other...night.${prompt}
  8194: |-
    Head due south from here to a spot of buried bones and grass patches.
    Your prey lives there. But be careful, for he...bites?${prompt}
  8195: |-
    But the little critter will not be easily found.
    No, he will only show himself if he hears a...noise. Er, like a clap of the hands.${prompt}
  8196: |-
    I swear...I just can't seem to express myself properly these days.
    This accursed red sky is the cause of it all, I'll bet...${prompt}
  8197: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]}! Oh, thank you!
    I imagine-ethy it was not easily found!${prompt}
  8198: |-
    I've already seen to the rest of the preparations.
    Just hold tight-ethy!${prompt}
  8199: |-
    Shhh now...this is a precision operation.
    I must ensure-ethy the proper ratio, timing, and...egads!
    No, Yoran-Oran! Watch out-ethy...!${prompt}
  8200: |-
    Phew! That was a close call-ethy.
    Behold! The elusive counteragent!${prompt}
  8201: |-
    Now, all you need do is return to the gasponia and inject it!
    A dangerous job-ethy, of course, but you've done it once. You can do it again!${prompt}
  8202: 'You inject the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into stalk of the gasponia.${prompt}'
  8203: |-
    This gasponia is exuding a pleasantly mild scent.
    It would seem ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} has been administered quite recently.${prompt}
  8204: |-
    Incredible! A resounding success-ethy!
    The patients are already showing signs of improvement.${prompt}
  8205: However, I fear-ethy this solution will not be a permanent one.${prompt}
  8206: 'If we do not administer the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} on a regular basis, the plant will soon revert-ethy to its malignant state.${prompt}'
  8207: When you think about it, its innate proclivity for self-preservation is not so unlike-ethy you and I.${prompt}
  8208: |-
    Ahhh-choooooo!
    Yes, there's definitely something funny in the air-ethy. It's high time to administer another dose of ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, methink-ethies.${prompt}
  8209: 'Could I trouble you to find another ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}-ethy for me?${prompt}'
  8210: We're counting on you!${prompt}
  8211: |-
    ...Hm?
    A matter demands my utmost concentration. Please leave me.${prompt}
  8212: |-
    ...Hm? Come closer.
    Yes, you just might have what it takes...${prompt}
  8213: |-
    Tell me, have you noticed the positively putrid air quality in the chasm of late?
    Of course you have. Anyone with a nose would notice.${prompt}
  8214: |-
    A certain professor--who, to save him from embarrassment, I shall not name--believes it solely caused by a noxious plant that lies to the west.
    But does this theory hold water? No, it does not.${prompt}
  8215: |-
    For there is a far more prominent source right before our very eyes.
    I speak, of course, of the miasmas.${prompt}
  8216: |-
    You are familiar with them, no? Why, only a fool would not be!
    Noxious billows of black gas that seep up from cracks in the earth.${prompt}
  8217: |-
    Why, this foul smog is so thick as to completely obscure one's vision.
    Is there any reason not to think it is polluting our air as well? Allow me to answer that: there is not.${prompt}
  8218: |-
    Fortunately, there is a dedicated scientist in our ranks who has developed a means to rid Attohwa of these putrid clouds once and for all.
    I speak, of course, of Harith. That would be me, if I've neglected to introduce myself.${prompt}
  8219: “Allow me to hypothesize, Harith”, you say. “You have perfected the recipe, and lack only for a key reagent to prepare the solution--a reagent that you will now ask me to procure.”${prompt}
  8220: 'To which I would then reply: not exactly!${prompt}'
  8221: |-
    I would ask you to procure the reagent, synthesize the solution, and then go test it for me, all in one fell swoop!
    You will have to forgive me. This sickly body of mine--which the heavens have inflicted upon me as a trade-off for my genius mind--would hardly survive a trek through the chasm.${prompt}
  8222: |-
    Aid in Harith's research?
    ${selection-lines}
    It's for a worthy cause.
    I have better things to do.${prompt}
  8223: Is that so? My hypothesis that you were a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] of sense and courage was clearly mistaken.${prompt}
  8224: Excellent! I knew you wouldn't let me down.${prompt}
  8225: |-
    This is my top-secret recipe.
    Guard it with your life.${prompt}
  8226: |-
    Synthesize the solution, test it on a miasma, and report back to me your findings.
    A simple enough task, no?${prompt}
  8227: A noxious black gas billows forth from a fissure in the ground.${prompt}
  8228: The miasma thins, then dissipates before your eyes.${prompt}
  8229: 'Brilliant! Thanks to you, we''ve made a crucial discovery: that my theory was one hundred percent as flawless as I thought it was!${prompt}'
  8230: |-
    The density of the pollutant, divided by air volume, adjusted for temperature and humidity level...
    Yes, like so...${prompt}
  8231: |-
    Ah! Forgive me, friend.
    I was just reviewing my latest theory.${prompt}
  8232: |-
    Though my ${item-singular: 0[2]} is remarkably effective in dispersing miasmas, a larger problem remains.
    The subterranean source of these vile fumes must eventually be dealt with.${prompt}
  8233: |-
    We have taken but a single step, but it will prove to be a giant one for all of our kind.
    I am sure of it! Ahahaha!${prompt}
  8234: Oh, miracle of miracles!${prompt}
  8235: The sky may be blood-red, and nasty-wasty fiends may threaten to devour us at any momentaru, but I must give thanks that I am still alive!${prompt}
  8236: |-
    I was in Jeuno with my darling son, whiling away the hours for my sweet husband-wusband to return from a business trip.
    Next thing I knew, I was on an airship plummet-wummeting into the chasm, flames and fiends everywhere!${prompt}
  8237: |-
    But my dearest Panta-Putta was nowhere to be seen. No one else said they saw him on the ship...that's it! I must have left him in Jeuno, where it's safe. Yes, that must be it.
    The others say that Jeuno fell, but that just can't be! Its high walls, and the Archduke, and that scary-wary Wolfgang to defend it.${prompt}
  8238: |-
    The others don't know what they're talking about. That was a scary-wary crash, I'm sure they're just in shock. My little boy is safe in Jeuno and waiting for his mommy to come home, I'm sure of it.
    I'm sorry, I just can't think straight these days. Yes, I must be grateful-wateful just to have my life.${prompt}
  8239: Oh, drat! This won't do at all!${prompt}
  8240: Here I had the wonderful idea of treating my fellow survivors to a piping-wiping hot bowl of Tarutaru stew, and yet...why, I am the only Taru in sight! Wherever will I find the choice cuts of--${prompt}
  8241: |-
    Oh, heavens-weavens, what am I saying!? Tarutaru stew is made by Tarutaru, not of them!
    Forgive me, it must be this red sky that is putting these awful-wawful thoughts in my mind...${prompt}
  8242: |-
    What I meant to say was that I seem to have misplaced my favoritaru stewpot!
    Without it, the flavor just doesn't turn out as savory, I tell you.${prompt}
  8243: |-
    I could have sworn that I had it with me on the airship.
    Come to think of it, I can't shakey-wake the feeling that I've misplaced something else as well...${prompt}
  8244: That's it! I'd recognize my favorite stewpot anywhere!${prompt}
  8245: |-
    But what's this? Why, there's a hole in the bottom!
    Why, if I used this, all the succulent chunks of Taruta--no, no, bad Naruru!
    I mean, the chunks of some meat that is decided-widedly not Tarutaru will escape!${prompt}
  8246: |-
    <Sniff>... And it was a special order from the Windurst Culinarians' Guild.
    Wherever will I find a new one?${prompt}
  8247: |-
    My stewpot! Why, it looks just like the day I boughtaru it!
    However did you manage that?${prompt}
  8248: |-
    Finally, I can treat the others to a scrumptious-wumptious Naruru stew. I mean, Naruru's stew!
    I can't make a stew and be in it at the same time...silly Naruru. Now where did you put those ingredientarus...?${prompt}
  8249: '...${prompt}'
  8250: I can't stop thinking about my sweetaru husband and son.${prompt}
  8251: |-
    Teigero hadn't gotten back before I left...but why did I get on the airship in the first place?
    For the life of me, I just can't remember.${prompt}
  8252: |-
    If only they were here now, I would put them into--no!
    I mean, treat them to a bowl of piping hot stew!
    Oh, Naruru, whatever has gotten into you!?${prompt}
  8253: You call yourself ${name-player}?${prompt}
  8254: Well, I've never heard of you.${prompt}
  8255: But don't be discouraged. Just keep working at it, and you'll make a name for yourself eventually.${prompt}
  8256: ${name-player}, eh? Hmm... That name is vaguely familiar. But I'm afraid few in the chasm have heard of you.${prompt}
  8257: If you keep doing whatever you're doing, I'm sure more of the survivors will come to seek your help. Good luck.${prompt}
  8258: "Oh, so you're ${name-player}... \nYes, I heard some of the people here in camp talking about you.${prompt}"
  8259: |-
    It seems you've built up a reputation.
    Keep up the good work, and greatness surely lies in your future.${prompt}
  8260: |-
    Hello, ${name-player}! I hear your name mentioned quite often these days.
    You've done well, my friend. Keep at it.${prompt}
  8261: Hello, ${name-player}! A good deal of people here in camp know about you!${prompt}
  8262: And they all say you're quite the do-gooder! Thank you for helping us in these dark days. Keep up the good work!${prompt}
  8263: |-
    ${name-player}! To all of us here, your name is synonymous with courage and sacrifice!
    Not a day goes by without hearing of your saintlike service.${prompt}
  8264: |-
    I speak for all of us when I express my sincerest appreciation for your generosity.
    Come what may, for the rest of our days we shall never forget you, the Angel of Attohwa!${prompt}
  8265: Greetings. I'm in charge of keeping the records of your exploits.${prompt}
  8266: I heard of your recent accomplishments, ${name-player}. Well done!${prompt}
  8267: |-
    This is a token of thanks from all of us.
    Take it, and stand proud!${prompt}
  8268: Spectacular! Why, you've accomplished anything and everything that we could have ever expected from you!${prompt}
  8269: |-
    You truly are an inspiration to us all.
    Please promise that you'll remain by our side always.${prompt}
  8270: |-
    Hail, stranger.
    Come here for a moment...${prompt}
  8271: |-
    I do not see the light of the visitant on you.
    This won't do at all, I'm afraid.${prompt}
  8272: You'll be wanting to speak to the conflux surveyor with due haste.${prompt}
  8273: |-
    I do hope you have ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} or two.
    Without it, even the surveyor will be powerless to assist.${prompt}
  8274: |-
    I see the light of the visitant shines from you.
    Excellent.${prompt}
  8275: Whether you're here in camp or roaming the chasm, you'll want to keep yourself in that state at all times.${prompt}
  8276: |-
    Without it, not only do you place yourself in danger, but you'll have a hard time convincing the survivors to talk to you.
    They're a bit chary of strangers, you see. Not that anyone could blame them after all they've been through.${prompt}
  8277: They'll also keep a wide berth of you if they see you sporting one of those pennants that identify you as a member of resistance effort.${prompt}
  8278: |-
    Pray do not take umbrage at this.
    'Tis not that they mistrust you, merely that they wish not to impose upon those on active duty.${prompt}
  8279: When you are off-duty again, with your pennant removed, you will find them all too eager to share with you their troubles.${prompt}
  8280: <Cough, hack>...${prompt}
  8281: |-
    Ah...<wheeze>...forgive me.
    I seem to have come down with a case of the sniffle-wiffles.${prompt}
  8282: |-
    Before I contracted this illness, I was quite the accomplished soldier myself.
    Let me share with you a bit of knowledge I acquired in my many battles againstaru the hordes.${prompt}
  8283: |-
    Those nasty critters are far more intelligent than they look.
    Make swift work of a few, and their friends won'taru hesitate to call for reinforcements.${prompt}
  8284: What's more, each one will prove more frightful-wightful than the last!${prompt}
  8285: Fortunately, as tough as these bug-wuggers are, they also have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by the astute battler.${prompt}
  8286: |-
    Strike them where it hurts, and they'll be left in a vastly weakened state.
    It would not be an understatementaru to call this the key to victory.${prompt}
  8287: Also, you'll observe that the light of your visitant will glow all manner of pretty-wetty colors upon defeating a foe.${prompt}
  8288: |-
    I've observed that the color depends on the...<cough>...killing-willing blow you...<cough>...strike...
    <Hack>...<wheeze>...This is my cue to shutaru up, it seems. Good luck in your...<hack>...battles!${prompt}
  8289: |-
    They sent the lot o' us here from Heavens Tower usin' some barmy mass-teleport magic.
    That was the idea, 't least. When I came to me senses, there weren't nobody else in sightaru.${prompt}
  8290: I was right lucky to meet up with me mate Gottah here after a bit o' wandering.${prompt}
  8291: |-
    Wherever could the others've gone off to?
    I do hope they didn't meet a foul end...${prompt}
  8292: Wait a bleedin' minute here...${prompt}
  8293: 'Oi, Gottah! ${choice: 0}[This is no time to be arsin''-warsin'' about!/We got ourselves a bloody-wuddy emergency on our hands!]${prompt}'
  8294: |-
    Veteran adventurers like ourselves are one thing, but rookies-wookies won't stand a chance out there alone.
    We're jus' doin' our part to save who we can.${prompt}
  8295: Gee, my head hurrrts...${prompt}
  8296: I thought it was just the Federation that fell to the horrrdes, but people here're sayin' that Jeuno went down 'n blazes too.${prompt}
  8297: This chasm ain't a frrriendly place, but perhaps it's as good as anywhere under this blood-rrred sky.${prompt}
  8298: |-
    <Grrroan>...
    Sorry, but could ya jus' leave me be?${prompt}
  8299: |-
    Ever since I came to this chasm, just walkin' around is sappin' me of all my enerrrgy.
    I got nothin' left...empty, kaput!${prompt}
  8300: |-
    <Grrroan>...
    Sorry, but could ya jus' leave me be?${prompt}
  8301: |-
    The fiends out there are too tough for a rookie like me.
    I gotta get back trrrainin'...soon as I get over this blasted headache.${prompt}
  8302: |-
    Ahhhhhh-choo!
    <Hack>...<cough>...<wheeze>...${prompt}
  8303: Ahem... Pardon my mucus, if you please.${prompt}
  8304: |-
    Since arriving in this chasm, my piteous nose
    will simply not stop running-wunning, despite numerous blows.${prompt}
  8305: |-
    What's that, you say?
    You're curious as to the quality of the air today?${prompt}
  8306: Well, judging from my sniffle-wiffling frequency...${prompt}
  8307: '...It''s quite clear today, oh joy and glee!${prompt}'
  8308: |-
    That said, if experience is any guide
    we cannot count on this state to abide.${prompt}
  8309: '...It''s still far from ideal, as I''m sure you''ll agree.${prompt}'
  8310: |-
    Still, I can say that it's been much worse.
    At this rate, we might even see our patients' symptoms reverse.${prompt}
  8311: |-
    Ah-choo! Ah-choo!
    <Cough>, <sniffle>, <hack>, <wheeze>!${prompt}
  8312: Thif if af bad af it'f been...<honk>...bake be fpeak bo more, pfease!${prompt}
  8313: I have a matter of minor concern...${prompt}
  8314: That robed fellow by the conflux, he wears an expression most stern.${prompt}
  8315: He speaks of miasmas contaminating the air...${prompt}
  8316: |-
    ...While the Professor speaks of flowers.
    Could there also be truth there?${prompt}
  8317: |-
    Whatever should we do?
    If we don't solve our air...<wheeze>...problem...ah-ah...ah-chooooo!${prompt}
  8318: |-
    Good to see you in one piece.
    Are you headin' up to the camp?${prompt}
  8319: |-
    Ascend to camp?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    Not now.${prompt}
  8320: |-
    Roger that one.
    Just a moment, now...${prompt}
  8321: Oi, Alrauverat! Send down the rope ladder!${prompt}
  8322: |-
    Heading out to the field? It's a long way down.
    Shall I lower the rope ladder?${prompt}
  8323: |-
    Leave camp?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    Not now.${prompt}
  8324: Hold on tight, now...and don't look down.${prompt}
  8325: How curious. Other than a few scrapes, you seem to be a picture of perfect health.${prompt}
  8326: |-
    A good number of the survivors have experienced significant trouble breathing since arriving here in Attohwa.
    For some of them, it seems even to have affected their minds...${prompt}
  8327: Do take care of yourself, friend.${prompt}
  8328: <Wheeze>...<hack>...${prompt}
  8329: |-
    Forgive me, young'un.

    The wife is holdin' up better than I.
    I wish I knew where she...<wheeze>...gets 'er strength from.${prompt}

    What can I say, the ol' wife takes good care o' me.

    My husband and I escaped from Jeuno, but ever since we got here...<sniff>...we just haven't been feelin' the same.${prompt}
  8337: |-
    We were always...<cough>...healthy for our age.
    Whatever could be the...<wheeze>...problem?${prompt}
  8338: Thank ye, dearie. I'm feelin' better, but my poor husband's in rough shape.${prompt}
  8339: |-
    Do y'hear me, dear? You have to think happy thoughts.
    It's like you always used to say...mind over matter!${prompt}
  8340: |-
    Sweet o' you to show your concern, dearie.
    M' husband and I are feelin' much better, thank ye.${prompt}
  8341: |-
    We were even going to go for a walk together, but a guard stopped us.
    Ah well. Can't blame them for bein' careful, can I?${prompt}
  8342: |-
    See the chocobos over there?
    We lower them down from here when we need 'em.${prompt}
  8343: |-
    I hardly have t' tell ya, but this is quite the task.
    Brutus gives us the orders, and still it takes a few of our strongest men to do the job.${prompt}
  8344: It's a hassle, but it's the only way we can keep 'em from runnin' off, y'see.${prompt}
  8345: |-
    Brutus is somethin' else though, ain't he?
    A Galka like me, that's one thing, but I'd never figure a Hume to be able t' pull it off.${prompt}
  8346: |-
    He says it's 'is love for the birds that gives 'im strength.
    Pretty touching, don't ya think?${prompt}

    Cross this footbridge to the other side of the chasm, make your way through the cave, and eventually you'll come to Parradamo Tor.
    Or are you headed for the outpost, by any chance? Then you'll want to follow this narrow path along the cliff face before me.${prompt}
  8348: Wherever you're headed, I recommend you activate any veridical confluxes you encounter.${prompt}
  8349: It'll cost you cruor, of course, but it'll make future travel that much easier.${prompt}
  8350: |-
    I don't recall seeing your face among our passengers...?
    Me? I was a navigator on the airship that fled Jeuno.${prompt}
  8351: |-
    Been doing this job for years, but nothing could have prepared me for that fateful day.
    Taking off from port with those fiends tearing at our vessel, and our decks and holds overflowing with refugees...${prompt}
  8352: Even more shocking than those beasts were the panic-stricken faces of those townspeople we had to leave behind.${prompt}
  8353: |-
    Then, just when we thought we were home free, we saw a rain cloud billowing in the distance.
    Turns out it was no cloud, but rather a swarm of the nastiest gnats of a size I'd never seen.${prompt}
  8354: Before we knew what hit us, we were plummeting to the bottom of this chasm.${prompt}
  8355: |-
    It's a wonder any of us survived, but we did.
    Picked ourselves out of the wreckage, and made our way up here.${prompt}
  8356: |-
    To this day, I ask myself. If I'd plotted a different course, could we have avoided this fate?
    That said, I don't reckon that anywhere's safe in this world anymore.${prompt}
  8357: |-
    The location of the airship wreck?
    I can't say for sure. Poor vessel shattered into a thousand pieces when it struck the cliff face...${prompt}
  8358: What do you need to know that for, anyway?${prompt}
  8359: |-
    Some Taru lady's stewpot!?
    Pardon me for being blunt, but haven't you got more serious matters to worry about?${prompt}
  8360: '...My apologies. I shouldn''t rush to judgment.${prompt}'

    We all have to do what we must in these dark times.
    Anyway, if it hasn't fallen to the depths, the cargo should be scattered around here somewhere.

    My heart jumped. At least he will be safe, I thought!

  8419: |-
    Pack chocobos are bred especially for tractability, and will faithfully follow you at a single command.
    To minimize the risk of both animal and baggage being lost, they are also trained to stay put should they lose sight of their caretaker.${prompt}

    As to be expected, the chocobo's stamina gradually deteriorates over the course of labor.
    You would be doing it a kindness by taking no longer than necessary to complete your task.${prompt}

  8422: The creature's stamina will continue to deteriorate even during loading.${prompt}
  8423: It is your responsibility to make absolutely certain that it has sufficient energy remaining to make the return trip.${prompt}
  8424: Lastly, these hostile environs have caused the chocobos to revert to their natural instincts for self-preservation.${prompt}
  8425: The creatures have become highly skittish, and will startle and bolt should they catch scent of a monster.${prompt}
  8426: |-
    In attempting to flee, the chocobo will tire rapidly. There is also a chance that it will drop its burden.
    Should this happen, waste no time in securing and calming down the poor creature.${prompt}
  8427: |-
    Our avian allies play a crucial role in keeping the outpost well-provisioned.
    We do our utmost to keep them content and in fine feather, and would appreciate your cooperation in this regard.${prompt}
  8428: Ah, welcome back!${prompt}
