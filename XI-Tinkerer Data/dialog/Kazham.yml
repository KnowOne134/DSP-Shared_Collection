  9984: If you are ready to depart Kazham, pay the boarding fee at the counter on the other side.${prompt}
  9985: We always welcome adventurers to Kazham! You are like new seeds, carried in by the warrrm sea breeze.${prompt}
  9986: We hope that your dreams grrrow under our shining sun.${prompt}
  9987: Have you ever been to Windurrrst? A tribe of Mithrrra that left Kazham long ago is living there.${prompt}
  9988: All the aggressive ones left, while most of the laid-back ones stayed. That's why Kazham is so peaceful.${prompt}
  9989: 'You''re one of those ${choice: 0}[people/people/people/people/people/people/people/Mithra/people] borrrn over in the mainlands.${prompt}'
  9990: You may think that we Mithra all wanderrr around, never settling down in one place, but you're wrong. Spend a little time here, and you'll see our true colors.${prompt}
  9991: Hey therrre, adventurer! Have you got your fill of Kazham?${prompt}
  9992: What about that volcano to the east of herrre? Bet you haven't been therrre yet, have you?${prompt}
  9993: What's wrrrong, young adventurer? You look like you've got something on your mind.${prompt}
  9994: Whenever something's trrroubling me, I sit back and relax in the Kazham sun, and everything is fine.${prompt}
  9995: '...${prompt}'
  9996: '...${prompt}'
  9997: |-
    A familiarrr scent clings to you, adventurer.
    The aroma of rich earth, and a fresh breeze...it brings me back to long ago.${prompt}
  9998: |-
    ...But these are merely the rrramblings of one whose days in the sun have long since passed.
    Be safe in your travels, adventurer.${prompt}
  9999: Now that routes to the Outlands have been opened, gobs and gobs of adventurers have been running in and out of Kazham.${prompt}
  10000: We thought that we researchers from the Rhinostery could help-ity out those new to Elshimo.${prompt}
  10001: It looks like Perih Vashai, Master of the Azure Bow, has become chieftainness of the trrribe in Windurst.${prompt}
  10002: I heard that she got that position for catching sinnerrrs that had escaped from Kazham during the Grrreat War.${prompt}
  10003: You've heard of the Tonberries, rrright? They may look small, but they pack a punch...and they keep coming back for morrre, no matter how many you take out!${prompt}
  10004: When you're outside the town gates, you should watch your back...those guys will stab you in it!${prompt}
  10005: We Mithra are bound to this land. We listen to its cries, protect it, and rrrespect it.${prompt}
  10006: When a group changes where it lives, the lives of that group change with it, but the ties with the land do not.${prompt}
  10007: Adventurer, are you? Well, why don't you trrry your luck in Ifrit's Cauldron?${prompt}
  10008: You can't say you've been to Yuhtunga unless you've seen the volcano!${prompt}
  10009: Wow! You say you got here by airship? Prrretty good for an adventurer!${prompt}
  10010: Someday I'd like to trrravel around Vana'diel on one of those flying ships. Thanks to the chieftainness, it's easier to travel outside of Kazham these days.${prompt}
  10011: Hey, you! Did you brrring anything interesting from the mainland?${prompt}
  10012: Nothing? What kind of an adventurerrr are you? The other day, this Hume from Bastok showed us the coolest thing! Afterrr that, he was the most popular guy in town!${prompt}
  10013: Whenever I hearrr the sound of the ocean, I always think it sounds like someone calling “slee～p, slee～p.” Can you hearrr it too, ${choice-player-gender}[misterrr/lady]? ${prompt}
  10014: You shouldn't fight it when you do. It's best to just lie down and...<yawn>...${prompt}
  10015: Hey, you're an adventurer, arrren't you? I wouldn't want you to get lost. Let me give you a little help.${prompt}
  10016: The jungle rrright outside the village gates is the Yuhtunga Jungle. To the south of the Yuhtunga Jungle is the Yhoator Jungle. Did you get all that?${prompt}
  10017: This is just a rrrumor, but I heard that the chieftainness has the hots for some old Hume guy.${prompt}
  10018: I can't see why any Mithra would go for a Hume guy. What's good about a guy that can't even pick up the scent of his prrrey?${prompt}
  10019: When it comes to knife-throwing, there isn't a soul that can match the skill of our chieftainness. I advise staying on herrr good side.${prompt}
  10020: Nothing in this world is crrreated good or evil. However, evil can arrrise when something exists in a place where it did not originally belong.${prompt}
  10021: To rrreturn these things to the place where they belong, we must often rrreceive help from the hand of nature. This is also true when currring disease and healing wounds.${prompt}
  10022: Things meant to live will live. Things meant to die will die when their time has come. However, this does not mean you should cease your strrruggle for life.${prompt}
  10023: Kazham is protected by the guardian of the volcano located east of herrre. With his laughter and anger, the guardian shakes the earth and grants us the strrrength to survive.${prompt}
  10024: To show our thanks every day, we take the guardian offerings of our best crops. This is how it has been for hundreds of yearrrs.${prompt}
  10025: It doesn't look like you're doing much more than being in the way. How about taking a trip to the volcano and showing your face to our guarrrdian?${prompt}
  10026: If you're lucky, you might even hear his rrroar! Hah-hah-hah!${prompt}
  10027: |-
    So, are you going to make yourself useful?

  10029: What? Did you think I was going to provide you one for frrree? What good is an offering of thanks if it isn't YOU who's showing the thanks?${prompt}
  10030: Now listen up. Enter the volcano and journey up to the crrrater. There you will find an altar that we made.${prompt}
  10031: 'After you''ve placed the ${item-singular: 1[2]} on the altar, you must shout your name into the crater so the guardian of our land can hearrr.${prompt}'
  10032: 'Oh, and you should probably take a couple ${item-plural: 2[2]} with you. You never know when you will need them.${prompt}'
  10033: Well, if that's the case, why don't you just take the next airship and get off of our island?${prompt}
  10034: 'Travel east to the towerrring volcano. Walk up to the crater and place ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} on the altar therrre. Oh, and don''t forget to shout your name.${prompt}'
  10035: And shout it like you mean it. If your voice is heard by our guarrrdian, then your stay on our island should be a safe one.${prompt}
  10036: 'Oh, so you''re going to grrreet the guardian of this island? Well, you''re going to need some ${item-plural: 2[2]} to get up the volcano.${prompt}'
  10037: Once you've made the offering and been accepted by our guardian, you will be one of us. That is, if you come back alive.${prompt}
  10038: Oh, you made it back in one piece! You look a lot tougher now than you did beforrre you left.${prompt}
  10039: We Mithra like our ${choice-player-gender}[men/women] strong and brave like you. Here, take this.${prompt}
  10040: No matter who or what you are, without strength, you'll make no impression on this worrrld.${prompt}
  10041: The guardian has hearrrd your voice and accepted you. You're now one of us!${prompt}
  10042: Enjoy the rest of your stay in our lush paradise of Kazham!${prompt}
  10043: Hey! You here on business? Pleasure? How about a nice souvenirrr before you go back home?${prompt}
  10044: Can you really get everything that you want on the mainland?${prompt}
  10045: Can't, can you? Everything you want is rrright here!${prompt}
  10046: When you die, you can't take anything with you, but what fun is life if you don't have anything to live it up with?${prompt}
  10047: Sometimes a strrrange Hume comes from the south to buy stuff. I wonder what he's doing down there...${prompt}
  10048: You don't want to get whipped by those Tonberries, do you? Well, have I got the equipment forrr you!${prompt}
  10049: Tough armor, strrrong weapons, food, supplies...it's tough getting all those items rrready before setting out on an adventure.${prompt}
  10050: I rrreally want to go on Chieftainness Jakoh Wahcondalo's Pilgrimage of Flames. However, without the prrroper equipment, I don't think I could make the trip all the way up to the peak of Ifrit's Cauldron.${prompt}
  10051: When we Mithra establish a new settlement, we call forth the powerrr of the guardian of that land, and craft a special bow.${prompt}
  10052: That bow is kept by the chieftainness as a symbol of the bond between us and the land we have chosen. The Thalassa Bow that Jakoh Wahcondalo carries is Kazham's bond with Elshimo.${prompt}
  10053: Ah, I love how my blades shine when wielded in the moonlight.${prompt}
  10054: And not just shine...my daggerrrs cut so well that even the chieftainness asked me forrr one...no, two!${prompt}
  10055: Wait a minute. You wouldn't happen to be one of those adventurerrrs from the mainlands, would you?${prompt}
  10056: I heard that if the prrrice was right, your type would go anywhere, do anything. So, ${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Miss] Adventurerrr, are your serrrvices for hire?${prompt}

    Wonderful. My eyes didn't deceive me.
    Now, have you ever heard of ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}? This rare wood does not even burn when thrown into the inferrrno of Ifrit's Cauldron.${prompt}
  10060: Deep in the hearrrt of the Yuhtunga Jungle, there is a giant tree known by the natives as the Firebloom Tree. It is protected day and night by mighty flames, though it never burns.${prompt}
  10061: 'The wood taken from the most heavily protected arrrea of the Firebloom Tree is called ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  10062: To find out which arrrea of the trrree is the most heavily protected, you must first retrieve four vines from its four sides. Then you must take those four vines to a place in Ifrit's Cauldron where firrre spits up from the rrrocks.${prompt}
  10063: |-
    Throw the four vines into the flames. The one that remains unburned is from the most heavily protected side of the Firebloom Tree.
    Finally, return to the jungle, cut off ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}, and bring it back here to me.${prompt}
  10064: Travel to the hearrrt of the Yuhtunga Jungle and cut four vines from the Firebloom Tree.${prompt}

  10069: By the way, have your trrravels ever taken you to Windurst?${prompt}
  10070: The chieftainness of that trrribe, Perih Vashai, carries with her a weapon known as the Azure Bow.${prompt}
  10071: There are many a song that tell of her ability to wield Purgatory Arrows. However, I have heard that her skills have faded since the Great War.${prompt}

    Do you know an Angelica?

    Of course.

    “Dear Chieftainness,
    My name is Angelica, and I'm the best artist here in Windurst. This may seem sudden, but I have a favor to ask. The other day, I heard an adventurer talking about her journey to the Temple of Uggalepih.${prompt}
  10082: “She said she came across a rrroom that resembled an art gallery. The walls were covered with numerous frames, but in these frames there were no paintings.${prompt}
  10083: “Ever since I picked up my first brush, I have dreamed of having my works put on display at a private exhibition. After hearing this adventurer's words, I feel that this may be my chance.${prompt}
  10084: “Chieftainness, you've got to let me display my works in the Temple of Uggalepih's gallery. I'll even pay you, if that's what you want.”${prompt}
  10085: This girl has got to be either crazy or stupid. I wonder if that adventurer actually told her what kind of place the temple rrreally is?${prompt}
  10086: |-
    You. Come over here.
    If you are traveling in Windurst, I'd like you to deliver this letter to a Hume by the name of Angelica.${prompt}

  10088: Those Humes... I haven't been this surprised since the former chieftainness...${prompt}
  10089: But that's nothing for you to worry about! Now hurry off and deliver that letter to Windurst.${prompt}
  10090: And tell this Angelica that the Temple of Uggalepih is no place for her fancy mainland modern art.${prompt}

  10102: That's right. You're going to put that painting up. If you don't want to do it, you go back and tell her yourself.${prompt}
  10103: Now off with you!${prompt}
  10104: You're on this boat for the long haul, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/missy]. You jump off now, you'll be taking down someone's dreams with you.${prompt}

  10116: I will try explaining to Angelica what happened this time in a letter, but I doubt she will listen...${prompt}
  10117: I would ask you to do it, but after what happened to her painting, I don't think it would be a very good idea if you showed up at her door.${prompt}
  10118: Hey, listen to this! That Angelica has sent another letter!${prompt}

    “Dear Chieftainness,
    I thank you for all of your assistance with my private exhibition.${prompt}

  10205: However, these uncivilized brutes will not listen to a word I say. Oh, how they mock me and my teachings.${prompt}
  10206: From what I have been able to gather, these primitive women believe that Vana'diel itself is their goddess.${prompt}

  10249: And then, out of thin air, appeared a group of these furry little beasts. I think the natives refer to them as Opo-opos.${prompt}
  10250: They told me that due to the recent influx of adventurers, the jungle was ravaged and their food supply was dwindling.${prompt}

  10406: After that accident with the Rafflesia flower, she hasn't been able to rrremove that odor from her body. If you don't do something about that stench on you, you'll end up just like her!${prompt}

  10545: |-
    That's where you come in.
    I was thinking of letting one of you adventurers test out the new fork and prove to my colleague that it is able to return data valuable to his research.${prompt}
  10546: |-
    No no no no no!
    Even if they use that half-rate spork, it'll take a tip-top summoner to defeat the prime avatar!${prompt}
  10547: |-
    Listen up.
    The fandangled ${item-singular: 1[2]} won't make it any easier for you to downright defeat the monster inside the crystal. Sure, it'll lower the power of the prime avatar to around ${number: 3}, but it will do the same to you! And on top of that, you'll only be able to summon that itty-bitty blue bugger, Carbuncle!${prompt}
  10548: And to make things worse, nobody-buddy else can enter the crystal with you! You'll be battling one-on-one, man-to-man, Taru-et-Taru!${prompt}
  10549: |-
    ...
    Yes, but sir... The Rhinostery has been pressing us to produce results. If we do not take some sort of action quickly...${prompt}

    ${selection-lines}

    On second thought...${prompt}
  10554: |-
    Well, you asked for it!
    Take this ${item-singular: 1[2]} and ring it near one of those giant crystals. The prime avatar won't be slap-happy to be woken up, and you'll have to deal with its wrath.${prompt}
  10555: 'I guess because you are helping us check out this new tuning fork, I can use my mighty-minty magic to warp you near the giant crystal in ${choice: 2}[Ifrit''s Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei''Yin/the Boyahda Tree].

    Really quit your training?

  10641: If you could handle that beast, then you are more than worrrthy to learn my new technique. Now let's begin...${prompt}

  10692: Your worry is misplaced.${prompt}
  10693: Having a bunch of Tarutaru concerned for her welfare would be an insult worse than death for a trrracker.${prompt}
  10694: While it is trrrue that a tracker's senses are dulled in the Northlands, she's not some kitten to lose her way in the snow.${prompt}
  10695: But if she never returns, this situation vill escalate into a crime the Rhinostery mustaru answer to, correct?${prompt}
  10696: The allied expedition is a case-vase in pointaru.${prompt}

    Greetings, friend! I am a synergy engineer, dispatched from the Institute to maintain the furnaces you see beside me.

  10836: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt}
  10837: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  10838: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt}
  10839: |-
    Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.
    If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt}
  10840: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  10841: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  10842: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  10843: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  10844: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  10845: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  10846: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  10847: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  10848: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  10849: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  10850: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10851: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  10852: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  10853: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  10854: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  10855: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  10856: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  10857: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  10858: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  10859: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10860: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  10861: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  10862: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  10863: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  10864: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  10865: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  10866: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  10867: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  10868: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  10869: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  10870: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  10871: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  10872: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  10873: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  10874: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  10875: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  10876: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  10877: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  10878: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  10879: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  10880: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  10881: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  10882: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  10883: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  10884: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  10885: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10886: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  10887: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  10888: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  10889: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  10890: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  10891: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  10892: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  10893: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  10894: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  10895: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  10896: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  10897: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  10898: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  10899: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  10900: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  10901: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  10902: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  10903: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  10904: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  10905: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  10906: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  10907: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  10908: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  10909: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  10910: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  10911: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  10912: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  10913: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  10914: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  10915: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  10916: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  10917: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  10918: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  10919: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?
    Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  10920: |-
    A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know.
    Let's see here...${prompt}

    Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one!
    Ain't synergy grand?${prompt}

  10939: |-
    I thought you'd never ask!
    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  10940: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  10941: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'
  10942: |-
    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  10943: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  10944: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  10945: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  10946: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  10947: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  10948: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}
  10949: |-
    That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.
    Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt}

    Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all.
    As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.${prompt}
  11101: We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.${prompt}
  11102: 'Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level ${number: 0}. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.${prompt}'
  11103: |-
    Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands.
    For reasons yet to be determined, however, both infusion and enrichment can be safely performed by laymen, provided they're at a planar rift.${prompt}
  11104: Keep this in mind should the need arise to reconfigure your atmacite with haste.${prompt}
