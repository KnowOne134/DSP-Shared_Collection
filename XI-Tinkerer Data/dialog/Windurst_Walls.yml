    Changing the layout.
    Mog House invitations.

  6742: The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!${prompt}
  6743: You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!${prompt}
  6744: The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!${prompt}
  6745: You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!${prompt}
  6746: If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!${prompt}
  6747: You can send items and gil to your friends with the “Send” command, kupo!${prompt}
  6748: (Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the "Exclusive" attribute, kupo...!)${prompt}
  6749: Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!${prompt}
  6750: I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!${prompt}
  6751: And...the rest is a secret, kupo!${prompt}

  6753: As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!${prompt}
  6754: This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...${prompt}
  6755: It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!${prompt}

  6757: Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the “Layout” command, kupo!${prompt}

    It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo!
    Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!${prompt}
  6759: You can invite party and alliance members into your Mog House, kupo!${prompt}
  6760: You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!${prompt}

  7254: You came to inquire about missions, huh? Then ask our guard leader-reader up there. He's certainly-mertainly a man with a mission or two.${prompt}
  7255: This is Heavens Tower's gatehouse, and we are the guards who protectaru Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  7256: You look new around these partarus. Do you know aboutaru the role of the gatehouses?${prompt}
  7257: |-
    Know much aboutaru gatehouses?
    ${selection-lines}
    No, I don'taru.
    Yes, enough.${prompt}
  7258: Oh, so you know aboutaru us? Then let's give you a mission to try your hand ataru!${prompt}
  7259: It's all aboutaru learning from experience. Don't worry aboutaru the details. Just accept a mission and see if you can completarue it.${prompt}
  7260: Gatehouses are where we guards keep a round-the-clock vigil.${prompt}
  7261: The role of guards is to protectaru Windurst from monsters and bad people. Or as we prefer to putaru it...we're the heroes of justaruice, libertaruy, and love.${prompt}
  7262: Gatehouses also serve as the places where importantaru missions from the Federation of Windurst are received and handed out to adventarurers.${prompt}
  7263: If you're a capable adventarurer, confidentaru in your own abilities, then why notaru take on a mission and serve to protectaru Windurst's justaruice, libertaruy, and love together with us?${prompt}

    Okay then...
    Hey, Keo-Koruo...!${prompt}

    ...Looks like he's preoccupied.

  7267: |-
    Roger-dodger!
    Let me see...
    What do I have for a first rank weakling...erm, I mean, newbie wanna-be adventurer like you...${prompt}
  7268: How about helping the Orastery to conduct a magic experiment? You might make a good guinea piggy-giggy.${prompt}
  7269: Seems like it's going down in the eastern magical tower-zower of the Horutoto Ruins out in Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  7270: I thought thataru Orastery mob was beyond help, but it looks like they're asking for a hand. Well, let's make this your first mission anyway, and see how you go with itaru.${prompt}
  7271: Head over to the Orastery building in Port Windurst and ask the minister there for the mission details.${prompt}
  7272: |-
    No greataru loss...
    If someone doesn'taru have their heart in it, then you can hardly expectaru them to provide good results, now can you?${prompt}
  7273: Anyway, come back and tell us when you feel like doing something for your country for a change.${prompt}
  7274: Head over to the Orastery building in Port Windurst and ask the minister there for your mission details.${prompt}
  7275: |-
    Oh, and just in case you didn'taru know...
    The Orastery is one of the five ministries of Windurst. It is also known as the “Mage Academy,” as itaru is the place where they train the most powerful magic users to help serve the Federation.${prompt}
  7276: Gee...why didn'taruy they let me give you the mission briefingy? I'm sick of serving as the punching bag for this angry Mithra and her list of complaintaruys.${prompt}
  7277: It's a long and higgledy-piggledy road to get the Orastery from here. First, you have to head south past the auction house and down the road that leads to Windurst Woods.${prompt}
  7278: Then you have to pass through to the western side of Windurst Woods and head out the exit to Port Windurst. You should be able to find the building-duilding by the shore there.${prompt}
  7279: I'm sure you're going to get totally-rotally lost, so make sure you check your map regularly, okay!?${prompt}
  7280: |-
    Well done!
    We'll allocatarue you rank points according to our evaluation of your mission. Come back again soon and try your hand ataru another mission.${prompt}
  7281: |-
    Well done!
    We'll allocatarue you rank points according to our evaluation of your mission. Come back again soon and try your hand ataru another mission.${prompt}
  7282: Were the Horutoto Ruins as topsy-turvy confusing for you as they are for me? No matter how many times I go there, I still manage to get lost.${prompt}
  7283: Somebody please do somethingy. I'm notaruy supposed to be the complaints desk, I'm supposed to be a hip and happening guardy!${prompt}
  7284: Hmm... Nextaru we have a mission from the Manustery!${prompt}
  7285: The Manustery is another one of the five ministries of Windurst. Seems they need assistance in the creation of automaton guards ataru their Cardian workshop.${prompt}
  7286: |-
    Whataru do you reckon?
    Think you're up to this mission?${prompt}
  7287: |-
    Acceptaru this mission?
    ${selection-lines}
    Acceptaru.
    Decline.${prompt}
  7288: |-
    Greataru!
    Then head to the Manustery in Windurst Woods.${prompt}
  7289: You should be able to see a building high on the hill when you look up from the Bomingo Round in Windurst Woods. Thataru's the Manustery, otherwise known as the Cardian workshop.${prompt}
  7290: Go ask the staff who work ataru the Manustery's Cardian workshop in Windurst Woods for the details of your mission.${prompt}
  7291: To getaru to Windurst Woods from here, just cross the bridge and head south. Keep heading south pastaru the auction house and across the bridge there. I recommend you keep checking your map so as not to getaru lost.${prompt}
  7292: Windurst Walls is the scariestaruy district of Windurstaruy. Mainly because it is filled with Mithra like this oney.${prompt}
  7293: |-
    Ooopsy! I'm sorry!
    I didn'taruy mean to speak ill of the Mithra! Nice lady! Don'taruy bite me, lady!${prompt}
  7294: The automaton guards, known as Cardians, are the compilation of animation magic and are really-heally a remarkable invention.${prompt}
  7295: When they are newly created, they are just like little baby-mabies. As we teach them how to speak and how to fight, they quickly grow smarter and smarter!${prompt}
  7296: |-
    What's that you said?
    Don't you darrre rrrepeat that!${prompt}
  7297: Seems like you've settled into your life in Windurst quitarue well. I hope your fighting skills have also improved.${prompt}
  7298: We've prepared this nextaru mission for someone just like you.${prompt}
  7299: Your destaruination will be Giddeus--home of the Yagudo beastmen--on the other side of West Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  7300: Windurst and the Yagudo have long been enemies, fightaruing over the riches of Sarutabaruta since ancient times.${prompt}
  7301: But for the lastaru twenty years, since the war ended, Windurst has been working hard ataru maintaining peaceful relations with the Yagudo.${prompt}
  7302: As a sign of our amicability, we provide them with food offerings. This is where your nextaru mission comes into the picture.${prompt}
  7303: You are to go and receive some food offerings from the Rhinostery over in Windurst Waters and deliver them to Giddeus.${prompt}
  7304: There are two altars for the offerings above ground before the entrances to inner Giddeus. In order to fulfill your mission, you are to place a food offering ataru each of these altars.${prompt}
  7305: The problem is...even though we are supposed to have amicable relations with the Yagudo, they do not allow us people to enter Giddeus. So once you setaru foot in there, you're fair game.${prompt}
  7306: I don'taru think we should have to risk our lives in order to deliver them a presentaru of food. But, oops, I've said too much. I never said thataru last bit, okay?${prompt}
  7307: Head over to the Rhinostery in Windurst Waters and pick up the food offerings for the Yagudo. Then go deliver them to Giddeus.${prompt}
  7308: Windurst Waters is west of where we stand in Windurst Walls. The quickestaru way to get there is to cross the bridge nextaru to Koru-Moru's manor.${prompt}
  7309: It's only natural that we need to keep patience-matience and put forth constant effort in order to be friends with the Yagudo.${prompt}
  7310: We're talking about a pack of beastmen. Their way of thinking is totally different from us people-beople. The first and foremost thing to strive for is to understand-ermand the other party.${prompt}
  7311: Oh, greataruy! Now this Mithra woman is angry over the mission you were just assignedy.${prompt}
  7312: Yes, we are providing notaruy only food, but weapons and armor, to the Yagudo. But such is the price of peacey.${prompt}
  7313: Don't you dare tell me you agrrreed to that mission of carrying offerrrings to the beastmen in Giddeus!?${prompt}
  7314: Grrr... And you think I'm going to stand by and let you do that without giving you a piece of my mind!?${prompt}
  7315: |-
    Good, good...
    Thataru seemed to go withoutaru a hitch this time.${prompt}
  7316: |-
    Oh, and congratarulations!
    Now thataru you've cleared three missions, you are entitled to advance to rank two!${prompt}
  7317: Before I can issue you another mission, we require you to participate in the conquest campaign for a while in order to amass some rank points. Speak to the guard in charge of conquests for further details.${prompt}
  7318: Let's keep working together to protectaru Windurst's justaruice, libertaruy, and love!${prompt}
  7319: |-
    You were promotarued to rank two?
    Boy, thataruy was quicky! Before I know it, you'll be a higher rank than me.${prompt}
  7320: |-
    Congratulations on advancing-mancing in rank!
    Say, now that you mention-bention it...just how many ranks are there? I've given up hope of further promotion so have forgotten-rotten.${prompt}
  7321: I don't give a damn whetherrr you went up to rrrank two or not.${prompt}
  7322: I only wish you'd hurry up and make these slackerrrs underrrstand just how overrrly apathetic and laid-back Windurst has become.${prompt}
  7323: |-
    How unusual..
    We have justaru received an urgentaru mission from the Optistery.${prompt}
  7324: The Optistery runs the local Library of Magic and is the mostaru rigid of Windurst's ministries. They usually keep to themselves and don'taru cause any trouble.${prompt}
  7325: Why don'taru you take up this rare chance of serving the Optistery, as it's sure got my interestaru plucked!${prompt}
  7326: |-
    Acceptaru this mission?
    ${selection-lines}
    Acceptaru.
    Decline.${prompt}
  7327: The Library of Magic thataru the Optistery runs is west of here, in Windurst Waters. To find out whataru the mission involves, speak to the Minister of the Optistery in the library there.${prompt}
  7328: You remember how to getaru to Windurst Waters, rightaru? Head west and cross the bridge nextaru to old Koru-Moru's manor.${prompt}
  7329: The Library of Magic thataru the Optistery runs is west of here, in Windurst Waters. To find outaru what your mission involves, speak to the Minister of the Optistery in the library there.${prompt}
  7330: You remember how to getaru to Windurst Waters, rightaru? Head west and cross the bridge nextaru to old Koru-Moru's manor.${prompt}
  7331: The books and scrolls made in Windurstaruy look justaruy like ordinary books and scrolls do. But what's inside is totally differentaruy!${prompt}
  7332: It's kind of like the wands in the Mage Academy, in thataruy those library books are dangerous things to play withy. You simply don'taruy know what bizarre enchantment has been placed on themy.${prompt}
  7333: I wonder-zonder if it is really true that all of the knowledge of Windurst is stored away in the Library of Magic?${prompt}
  7334: I've even heard-deard that a book written by the very first Star Sibyl is still preserved as new in there!${prompt}
  7335: |-
    A-hah!? Magic books, eh?
    I once hearrrd from someone that there was an uproarrr when a magic book fell into the hands of the Yagudo.${prompt}
  7336: |-
    But that's beside the point.
    For crrrying out loud...would you shorrrties get out of my way and let me meet the Starrr Sibyl?${prompt}
  7337: This mission will let you see the bestaru and worstaru of Windurst.${prompt}
  7338: The Aurastery, the ministry thataru runs the School of Magic, has issued a large-scale mission. It looks like it'll consume a fair amountaru of time, but if you're still up for itaru...${prompt}
  7339: |-
    Accept the mission?
    ${selection-lines}
    Acceptaru.
    Decline.${prompt}
  7340: The School of Magic, as the name suggests, is where we educate our promising young magic users.${prompt}
  7341: This mission will affectaru how these children will grow up, and therefore the whole future of Windurst. I pray you can putaru up a good fightaru!${prompt}
  7342: The School of Magic is in the Windurst Waters district, west of here. Quitarue a number of child prodigies study within the school grounds.${prompt}
  7343: Butaru to receive the details of this mission, you'll have to speak to the teachers in the staff room there. Good luck with this mission...for our children's future.${prompt}
  7344: Did you know thataruy the Principal of the School of Magic is the renowned Professor Koru-Moru?${prompt}
  7345: Years ago, the person Professor Koru-Moru appointarued as his successor to become principal ran away. What an awkward position that put him iny.${prompt}
  7346: There are two grades of students in the School of Magic. The exceedingly brilliant children-shildren are placed in the advanced class.${prompt}
  7347: On the other hand, the not-so-exceedingly brilliant students-dutents are placed into the beginners class. That's just the way the world works, I guess-fess...${prompt}
  7348: If you have enough time on yourrr hands to do that silly mission, why don't you lend us Mithra a hand forrr a change?${prompt}
  7349: Oh, come on. Give me a brrreak! Grrr...I've had it with these guarrrds!${prompt}
  7350: Looks like your time has finally come! Now's the startaru of an adventure that will take you all over the world!${prompt}
  7351: To be briefed on whataru your next mission entails, head on into the Heavens Tower Clerical Chamber. So chop-chop, you've gotaru a long way to go once you step inside here...${prompt}
  7352: I'd like a chance to try one of these large-scale missions, but I don't really think-fink I'm up to it.${prompt}
  7353: You see, I'm the type of Tarutaru who can't sleep on a different pillow-billow, gets seasick and airsick, and is disliked by every chocobo-kookobo he comes across. I'm just not cut out to travel-ravel.${prompt}
  7354: Have you ever had the chance to talk to Ms. Kupipi up in the Clerical Chamber of Heavens Taruwer?${prompt}
  7355: She may not look itaruy, but she has quite a noggin on her. Why, she's memorized all the names and faces of every guard and adventarurer in the whole of Windurstaruy!${prompt}
  7356: Any adventarurer wants to travel around the whole world, butaru when you are asked to do itaru for your country, then it's like killing two jubjubs with one Stone spell!${prompt}
  7357: Step inside Heavens Tower behind me and inquire ataru the Clerical Chamber to hear the full briefing of your mission. Hurry on up now!${prompt}
  7358: |-
    Hey!
    Just wherrre are you heading now?${prompt}
  7359: Well, when you speak to the Tarutaru inside of herrre, tell them to go see forrr themselves just how equipped otherrr countries are to fight off the beastmen.${prompt}
  7360: Thank goodness you stopped by! You have been summoned to go inside Heavens Tower again!${prompt}
  7361: And what's scarier still is thataru the person calling for you is none other than the Sibyl Guard Semih Lafihna, or as we at Heavens Tower call her...the defender of law and justaruice!${prompt}
  7362: Hurry up and head inside Heavens Tower. Semih Lafihna is a busy lady, and notaru someone you wantaru to keep waiting.${prompt}
  7363: As head of the Sibyl Guards, Semih Lafihna almostaru always carries out her investigations by herself.${prompt}
  7364: Itaru is most unusual for her to issue a mission such as this. Itaru kind of makes you wonder whataru is going on...? But there I go saying too much again.${prompt}
  7365: The Sibyl Guards are the Mithran warrior-borriors who serve the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  7366: They are all so serious-zerious and strong-drong and oh so cool-looking. Why, they are once...no, twice...no, thrice more fly than the other Mithra who stray about this town!${prompt}
  7367: Whenever you mention the Sibyl Guards to the other Mithra in this town, they screw their faces up into feline frowns.${prompt}
  7368: Don'taruy ask me why... You'll have to find out for yourselfy. Just don'taruy ask that Mithra woman therey. She'll scratch your eyes out with her tempery!${prompt}
  7369: |-
    I hearrrd that!
    You'rrre talking about the Sibyl Guards, rrright?${prompt}
  7370: They'rrre no Mithra, that mob. They werrre rrraised by the Tarutaru, so they have lost theirrr Mithran spirit! Why, they'rrre nothing more than a band of traitorrrs!${prompt}
  7371: |-
    Woo-hoo...
    Guess who this mission is from!${prompt}
  7372: Why, it's from the woman who has run the ladies-in-waiting with an iron fistaru for the last few decades, the oldest of the old guard, yes, it's the Star Sibyl's head lady-in-waiting, none other than Zubaba herself!${prompt}
  7373: Anyway, she's waiting for you up in Heavens Tower's Vestal Vestibule. This is one old lady you don'taru want to keep waiting!${prompt}
  7374: I don'taru think old Zubaba has ventured out from Heavens Tower for years now.${prompt}
  7375: In fact, it may even be decades since she lastaru stepped out of there. Then again, Heavens Tower would never be the same withoutaru her, so I guess she feels she can'taru leave.${prompt}
  7376: When I was selected to serve as a guard in front of Heavens Tower, I was over the moon-boon! Just the thought of becoming friend-priends with all those ladies-in-waiting...Hum-hmm...${prompt}
  7377: That dream was soon shattered-splattered when mean old Zubaba cracked down on the young ladies-in-waiting going outside. It brings tears to my eyes-cries!${prompt}
  7378: Zubaba's been running things in Heavens Taruwer since the currentaruy Star Sibyl was a child...which makes her pretty old when you think aboutaruy ity!${prompt}
  7379: It's a wonder she hasn'taruy become bored, locking herself up inside Heavens Taruwer for all that timey. I'm surprised she hasn'taruy turned into a mushroom by nowy!${prompt}
  7380: |-
    Hmm...
    This has to be a mistake.
    But I've checked itaru several times...${prompt}
  7381: 'Itaru appears to be ${keyitem-article: 4[2]} addressed to you. A letter with the star emblem on itaru, signifying it''s of the utmost importance, has been sentaru to you!${prompt}'
  7382: The mostaru revered person in all Windurst--if this isn'taru a mistake, thataru is--has summoned you!${prompt}
  7383: Letters with the star emblem on them like this one are the most importantaru papers issued by Heavens Tower. Usually they are only sentaru to elite people such as the ministers of the five ministries.${prompt}
  7384: Itaru is extremely rare for a star emblem letter to be issued to a lowly adventurer such as you... Hey, don'taru tell me you're an undercover agent checking up on us or something!?${prompt}
  7385: I'm not the least bit jealous-mealous! I've delivered a document with the star emblem on it to the minister-pinister of the Orastery before.${prompt}
  7386: I can remember I was so nervous-dervous back then. I was in a cold sweat at the thought of what punishment-bunishment would await me if I lost the darned thing.${prompt}
  7387: The entrance to Heavens Taruwer is justaruy therey. Don'taruy stand out here wondering what to do. Hurry up and go insidey!${prompt}
  7388: When you're up there in the Planetarium, could you please-blease make a wish for the peace of Windurstaruy?${prompt}
  7389: What's all the rrruckus about? Has something happened in Heavens Towerrr?${prompt}
  7390: Itaru's a pity I cannotaru welcome you back under better circumstances. If you haven'taru heard, Windurst is now officially in a state of emergency.${prompt}
  7391: Emergency orders have been given to all guards and adventarurers most loyal to Windurst, and the issuance of missions has been stopped pending further instructions from Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  7392: No matter how you look at it, you can't help but conclude something major-dajor is going down in Heavens Tower right now.${prompt}
  7393: The head of the Sibyl Guards, Semih Lafihna, has been going-zoing in and out of here all day. My arms are tired from giving her the Windurstian salute-dalute each time she passes by.${prompt}
  7394: The Minister of the Rhinostery, Ms. Rukususu, has come back to Windurstaruy.${prompt}
  7395: Although she's been in the arctic for such a long time, she was still as beautaruful as every. Oh, gosh! I think I'm falling for hery...${prompt}
  7396: This is an urgentaru mission from Heavens Tower!${prompt}
  7397: Your destination is the cursed Northlands...the ruins of Fei'Yin, northeastaru of the Beaucedine Glacier.${prompt}
  7398: There aren'taru that many adventurers who could survive a journey like this.${prompt}
  7399: I'm just relieved an adventarurer as strong as yourself has volunteered to make ${choice-player-gender}[himself/herself] available for this mission.${prompt}
  7400: It seems you need to collectaru a seal from within Heavens Tower before you go, so you had better go do thataru now.${prompt}
  7401: I pray you have a safe journey!${prompt}
  7402: Your mission's destaruination is the cursed Northlands...the ruins of Fei'Yin, northeastaru of the Beaucedine Glacier.${prompt}
  7403: If you don'taru have the necessary seal yetaru, then you should pick it up from within Heavens Tower before you departaru.${prompt}
  7404: Where in Vana'diel is this Fei'Yin place-blace? Huh? Way up north past-fast the Beaucedine Glacier?${prompt}
  7405: |-
    That still doesn't tell-jell me where it is...
    All I can make out is that it's going to be a really cold-old place. Better pack-zack your long johns!${prompt}
  7406: I just overheard a littarul from the people coming out of Heavens Taruwer.${prompt}
  7407: Sounds as if the very importarunt talisman that sealed away the spooky old lord of the beastmen has been stolen! Don'taruy tell me... You're being sent to retrieve it, rightaruy?${prompt}
  7408: 'I have a bad feeling about this, butaru another ${keyitem-singular: 4[2]} is addressed to you.${prompt}'
  7409: Maybe you are destined to carry out great deeds like the hero Karaha-Baruha, who saved Windurst twenty years ago.${prompt}
  7410: Anyway, you had better proceed on into Heavens Tower. I assume the Star Sibyl is awaiting you.${prompt}
  7411: The Star Sibyl is waitaruing for you in Heavens Tower. You'd better hurry and go inside.${prompt}
  7412: Go on to do great deeds, my friend. Just like the hero Karaha-Baruha did twenty years ago.${prompt}
  7413: Don't you sometimes wonder whether people and beastmen can really ever understand one another-brother?${prompt}
  7414: The Star Sibyl thought that someday we would understand-berstand one another and tried all manner of things to work to that goal, but nothing really changed.${prompt}
  7415: I wonder-monder if it is, as they say, set in the stars? The movement of the stars never changes-shanges, does it?${prompt}
  7416: It seems thataruy the meeting of the five ministries ended all too soony.${prompt}
  7417: Professor Koru-Moru turned up on time for once, and Minister Ajido-Marujido didn't even complainy! It was too quietaruy. I don'taruy like ity!${prompt}
  7418: Whether your name goes down in the history-mistory of Windurst or not doesn't matter. What you did was indeed a great deed-yeed!${prompt}
  7419: |-
    Thank you, adventurer-henturer!
    Please keep using that mighty-righty power of yours for the peace of Windurst!${prompt}
  7420: The ministaru of the Rhinostery, Ms. Rukususu, came out of Heavens Tower with the mostaruy cheerful look on her facey.${prompt}
  7421: Now my heart, too, is as brightaruy and cheerful as Windurstaruy isy. There isn't a cloud in sightaruy nowy!${prompt}
  7422: |-
    Why, hello～!
    And, oh...goodbye!${prompt}
  7423: |-
    Well, excu～se me, ${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Ms.] So-and-so!
    You shouldn't be walking into these premises without permission, you know!
    Ohoho...Ignorance is no excuse. No, no!${prompt}
  7424: |-
    This manor is where scholars, who have rendered many years of noble service to their ministry, can further enjoy the pursuit of knowledge in peace and quiet as a reward.
    It is not a place where plebeians like you should enter on your own accord!${prompt}
  7425: The Tarutaru with titles such as doctor or professor are the learned ladies and intelli-gents who served as ministers of the five ministries of Windurst.${prompt}
  7426: Do you know of the good Doctor Shantotto, my dear? Well, she was once the Minister of the Orastery, the ministry also known as the “Mage Academy,” where all the most-powerful mages of Windurst train. That's what I call a “mage-or-leaguer”!${prompt}
  7427: Gee... For safety's sake, I wouldn't recommend going-woing too close to Doctor Shantotto's manor! She thinks the whole world was made for her personal-wersonal pleasure.${prompt}
  7428: Doctor Shantotto, the former Minister of the Orastery, or “Mage Academy,” lives in this house here. I'm sure that she's hiding something-womething!${prompt}
  7429: Who am I? Well, I'm the reporter who's waiting to get a tell-all interview with her! You see, I write for the Tarutaru Times' “Magic Paradise Weekly.”${prompt}
  7430: They say old Doc Shantotto's as high-and-mighty as Yutungah's firey mountain, and as rough-cut as the rocky Gustaberg Ranges-wanges.${prompt}
  7431: I'm getting pretty nervous about meeting the grumpy old doc... If only I knew what kind of things she liked, I'd be able to buy her a little gift to make a good first impression-wession.${prompt}
  7432: No matter how scary they say old Doc Shantotto is, I should be okay...so long as I don't make her angry-wangry.${prompt}
  7433: Standing around here trying to ward off the heebie-jeebies is only delaying me from writing the story of the century-wentury. I've got to pluck up the courage and go confront-awont her!${prompt}
  7434: |-
    Lately, my dear, I have the most unpleasant feeling, you see...
    I feel as though someone is constantly watching me!${prompt}
  7435: |-
    It must be one of my many admirers, or maybe, I dare to think, even a spy!
    It is giving me the jimjams! I'm not a cheap street show, am I?${prompt}
  7436: |-
    I say... Would you like to help me, my dear?
    I'm thinking of showing that Peeping Tom just who he's up against...you hear!?${prompt}

    Ohoho... This will be quite a sight to see, so stick around!${prompt}
  7439: |-
    How dare you turn a poor, defenseless old lady like ME down?
    Do you think something so unpleasant will befall me that you'd rather watch from the sidelines than get involved? You clown!${prompt}
  7440: |-
    Most unforgivable, ${choice-player-gender}[I'm glad I'm not your sister/you big sissy]!

    Ohoho... Still haven't found me my ${item-singular: 6[2]} and two ${item-plural: 7[2]} yet? Well, I'm incensed!
    Hurry up. I can't wait to show my little voyeur just who he's up against!${prompt}

    Oh, goody.
    You've brought me my ${item-singular: 6[2]} and ${item-plural: 7[2]}, I see.
    Now to put these straight to good use...
    Ho～cus-po～cus, boogy-bogey fo～cus!!!${prompt}
  7443: Here, dear, take this as your reward. Ohohohoho!${prompt}

    You should have a little check around town tomorrow and see who's not doing so fine.

  7447: Just standing here, staring at her house all day, every day... And I call myself a reporter? Well, as of tomorrow, it's no more procrastination-wation for me!${prompt}
  7448: |-
    ...Erck!
    I haven't been feeling so good since the other night-wight...${prompt}

  7450: |-
    Ohoho!
    Our peeping Tom's been enjoying that Skeleton Dance curse I placed on him, no?
    But don't feel too sorry for him, as it'll wear off within a day or so.${prompt}
  7451: But, my, haven't I mellowed with age?${prompt}
  7452: |-
    You should have seen me back when I was the Minister of the Orastery.
    I pulled no punches at that stage. Ohohohoho～!${prompt}
  7453: Oh? You didn't see anyone doing the old Skeleton Dance, eh?${prompt}
  7454: |-
    That's most strange indeed...I say.
    It sure felt as if my curse had taken effect...well, either way...${prompt}
  7455: '...Erck...!${prompt}'
  7456: |-
    Ah! Thank goodness...there you are!
    I've been looking all over Windurst for you! Ha～h!${prompt}
  7457: |-
    Say...you don't happen to have any dependents, do you?
    Like, would anyone be saddened if you were put behind bars?
    Would anyone grieve if you, er...disappeared to the stars?${prompt}

    If you went missing, people would...

    Well, no matter, either way.
    That doesn't concern me today.${prompt}
  7460: |-
    Personally, I don't want to rot in prison, you see...!
    So, it's inevitable that you're the one who'll take the fall for me.${prompt}
  7461: |-
    Hey, you were my accomplice, you know!?
    You cannot say that it's not so.${prompt}
  7462: |-
    If you recall, without pride or plom...
    you're the one who helped me cast a curse on that peeping Tom!${prompt}
  7463: "You know...the Skeleton Dance curse, you cur!? \nI used your ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-plural: 5[2]}, along with my misery staff, to vex the voyeur.${prompt}"
  7464: |-
    Well, the truth is, that wasn't the “Skeleton Dance” curse I cast.
    It seems I did the old “Invoke the Grip of Death” curse, oh blast!
    (An honest mistake...that anyone would make...)${prompt}
  7465: |-
    So, we actually have hexed the person to death, I fear.
    Quite a disagreeable aftertaste for an act of sweet vengeance, dear.${prompt}
  7466: |-
    But maybe Death hasn't taken a complete hold of him yet.
    We might still have time to save him, so don't sweat!${prompt}
  7467: |-
    Oh, but to undo the curse, we'll need two ${item-plural: 6[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} and next...
    a lock of hair of the unfortunate person we hexed.${prompt}
  7468: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 7[2]} are quite hard to come by and it''s impossible to remove a lock of the cursed person''s hair without them noticing, I dread...${prompt}'
  7469: So I guess we may as well give up on that plan and just have you take the blame for the both of us and go to jail instead!${prompt}
  7470: |-
    Of course it won't be forever that you'll be locked in the cage.
    I'm sure you'll be out, say, just before I die of old age.
    But hey, remember, notoriety can bring fortune and fame!
    So you can have that all...along with the blame!${prompt}
  7471: |-
    Agree to go to jail?
    ${selection-lines}
    No way! Not on your life!
    Well, OK. If you say so...${prompt}
  7472: |-
    Ohoho! I'm glad you're so understanding.
    It makes matters as simple as you are, darling.
    All you have to do is go to the local gatehouse, confess to the crime, and turn yourself in.${prompt}
  7473: |-
    O～h!
    You're making me lose my temper, dear!${prompt}
  7474: |-
    Fine! If you want to avoid imprisonment, you'll just have to go find:
    two ${item-plural: 6[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}, and a lock of hair of the cursed person...if you don't mind.${prompt}

    If you can do that impossible feat,

    Oh, and gee...!
    You even managed to obtain the hair, I see...
    Which means he's still alive, and well, is he?${prompt}

    Which means neither of us need to go to jail after all!
    Ohoho! I'm so glad I don't have to wear a chain and ball.${prompt}

    Here. Let me remove that nasty curse without a moment's delay.

    I hope I'm not too late, dearie...
    Here it goes... Wha～mm～y!!!${prompt}

    I'm glad I've a knack for undoing hexes.
    It sure gets me out of such little vexes.${prompt}
  7486: |-
    Anyway, I've had enough of cursing for the time being.
    Here, I'll give you this Misery Staff...if you're agreeing.${prompt}
  7487: |-
    After all, it won't hurt to dispose of the evidence.
    Especially if the victim takes offense...ohohoho!${prompt}
  7488: |-
    Ohoho! Don't get angry with me for that little disgrace.
    It was the Orastery's mages who found that miserable staff in the first place.${prompt}

    But don't you worry about it. Control your lividity.
    I'll make sure they pay dearly for their stupidity. Ohohohoho!${prompt}

    Phew...
    I think I'm feeling a little better now-wow.${prompt}
  7491: It's like the mist has cleared from my eyes and the weight has been lifted from my shoulders. Why, it's almost as if that mystery illness never happened-wappened.${prompt}
  7492: Ergh... Why, diddly-doodley, do you bother me? I was just riding on the back of a fire dragon as she flew off into the starry night, too...${prompt}
  7493: Ergh... Why, diddly-doodley, do you bother me? I was just in mortal combat with the Shadow Lord, and about to receive a good-luck kiss from the maiden I saved, too...${prompt}
  7494: |-
    ...Hm?
    You must be the diddly-doodley one. You know, the adventurer who defeated the flan-dangle-wangled Shadow Lord. Yeah...${prompt}
  7495: Well, damn, good for you! Actually, a super-dooper-wooper spell to X-zone the Shadow Lord for good was supposed to be my twenty-three thousand thirty-fifth study subject, but you had to diddly-duddely go ahead and defeat him before I could complete it. Argh!${prompt}
  7496: You know the manor just in front of the bridge that leads out to West Sarutabaruta? Well, that's where an eccentriperculiar old man called Professor Koru-Moru resides. For a school principal, he's not that schooled or principled!${prompt}
  7497: Gee... That Professor Koru-Moru sure is a strange one. But what's even strangery-wangery is that they made him Principal of the School of Magic.${prompt}
  7498: Ergh... Why, diddly-doodley, do you bother me? I was just riding on an ice dragon as she flew around a silver moon, too...${prompt}

    A rough black stone?
    Yeah, the professorrr who lives in this manorrr once tried to give me one of those in lieu of his debts.${prompt}
  7510: Grrrowl! Just remembering it rubs my furrr the wrong way! The old fool claims those strange stones are really starrrs that fell from the sky or some such nonsense.${prompt}
  7511: <Sigh> When I sawy the falling stary the other day I made a wishy. I wishyed that Principal Koru-Moru would stoppy acting like a baby and get overy his stubbornness.${prompt}
  7512: Oh, dearie-dear? Has that spot-dotty Professor Koru-Moru got you running errands for him now? Typical of old Principal Koru-Moru...totally dependent on the grace of others. Most precarious!${prompt}
  7513: |-
    Did you know? Did you know?
    If you say a wish three times before a falling star disappears, it will come true! However, I always screw it up and get angry... Perhaps I'm star-crossed?${prompt}
  7514: Gee... The other night when I looked up at the starry-warry sky, a trail of lighty-wighty went “wooshy-wooshy,” streaming down to the ground. I think it would have hit the earthy-wearthy out there in West Sarutabaruta somewhere.${prompt}
  7515: Now that you mention-wention it, Professor Koru-Moru once showed me one of his rough black stones.${prompt}
  7516: He said an adventurer went out and found it for him, but I wonder where in Vana'diel you'd pick up something-womething like that?${prompt}
  7517: Oh, you know about those falling stars as well, huh?I've been fortunate enough to eye-spy and peek-a-boo a few of them myself, too.${prompt}
  7518: What did I wish for? Naturally, I wished that Windurst would have everlasting peace and prosperity, joy and security, success and serenity!${prompt}

  7520: |-
    Tho pleathe tell me...
    What happenth to the thtar when it fallth to earth? Can it find itth way home back to the thky again?${prompt}
  7521: The Tarutaru go all silly over making wishes on falling starrrs, but we Mithra don't believe in such nonsense.${prompt}
  7522: It's probably a harrrbinger that something really bad's about to happen. Heh, and about time, too. I've been yearrrning to run wild for a bit. Ahh, my blood is rrrushing already!${prompt}
  7523: As for us Mithra, we call falling starrrs “tears from heaven.” It is looked upon as a rrrather bad omen, though.${prompt}
  7524: There seems to have been a minor earthquake-o out in West Sarutabaruta the other day-o. I s'pose an airship-o dropped its cargo or somethin' naff like that-o...!${prompt}
  7525: Say-o, have you heard-o the old sayin'? You know-o, that the “Yagudo are the sweepers of Sarutabaruta”?${prompt}

  7670: Hello. I am Esmeralda. I am the consul of the Consulate of Jeuno in Windurst.${prompt}
  7671: Windurst and Jeuno formed an amicable alliance twenty years ago at the end of the Great War. It is for and on behalf of this alliance that we have consulates and embassies in each other's countries.${prompt}
  7672: Our main function is to render assistance to citizens of Jeuno who encounter trouble in foreign lands. So, most of the people who visit here are from Jeuno.${prompt}
  7673: As you are not a citizen of Jeuno, I assume this facility is of no immediate consequence to you.${prompt}
  7674: It's been about ten years since I left Jeuno to come to Windurst. In that period, I haven't had much of a chance to prove myself.${prompt}
  7675: This country is too easy-going, and it's begun to rub off on me. I can't let that happen anymore. It is my ambition that's made me what I am!${prompt}
  7676: What is my ambition? Do you think I'd be so brash as to tell the likes of you?${prompt}
  7677: Why don't you go first? Come on. Tell us all what your ambitions are!${prompt}
  7678: What do you mean, where is Jeuno? Haven't you ever seen a current map of the known world up till now?${prompt}
  7679: The Grand Duchy of Jeuno is midway between the continent of Mindartia and the continent of Quon. How could you overlook a country that is in the middle of the map?${prompt}
  7680: Sure, compared to a country like Windurst, the history of Jeuno is really short, but...${prompt}
  7681: Hey! Are you trying to be sarcastic in order to put Jeuno down? If that's what you're doing, then we won't let you off easy, you know?${prompt}
  7682: Are you surprised that Consul Esmeralda is so young? That is because in Jeuno, we have the tendency to rapidly promote able young people.${prompt}
  7683: Now is an era of great change. In such times as this, new ideas and vigor are essential.${prompt}
  7684: We believe knowledge and experience are impotent without youthful energy. When youths are knocked down, they can stand up again. They can run at full speed toward their goals. It is such energy that we, the younger generation, have in abundance.${prompt}
  7685: This is the entrance to Windurst's residential area, where there is a “Mog House” prepared for your use, taru.${prompt}

  7779: Is this the kind of thing the Starrr Onion Brrrigade can allow to happen?${prompt}
  7780: '......${prompt}'

  7844: |-
    Hullo-wullo!
    Are you from Windurst yourselfy-welfy? Or are you just another adventurer passing throughy-woughy?${prompt}
  7845: |-
    Either way, it's a dangerous place outside of this towny-wowny.
    If you intend on venturing outside, then you had better make sure your armor and weapons are properly equipped firsty-wirsty!${prompt}
  7846: Welcome to the magical town of Windurst.♪ Home of fun-loving Tarutaru and free-willed Mithra.${prompt}
  7847: |-
    You are now in Windurst Walls.
    It's a holy site revered by us Tarutaru since ancientaru times. I hope you enjoy your visitaru here.${prompt}
  7848: According to Principal Koru-Moru, there was once a great beasty that occasionally appeared in Sarutabaruta and ate any Tarutaru who happenedy to wandery by.${prompt}
  7849: I'm sure gladdy I livey in an age when such beasties no longer existy!${prompt}
  7850: You're not a childy anymore, so stop behaving like a spoiled bratty! I refuse to recognizey your notice of retirementy, Principal Koru-Moru!${prompt}
  7851: All the othery ministers have already gatheredy at Heavens Towery! So pleasey come outy, Principal Koru-Moru!${prompt}
  7852: Professor Koru-Moru, the old minister who lives in that manor there, is more famous for being the local ding-a-ling than for serving as the School of Magic's principal! I just know he's up to something in there!${prompt}
  7853: I came over to call in and have a little chitchat, but it seems as if he is, how shall we say...otherwise occupied...?${prompt}
  7854: Windurst Walls is the coolest-woolest place. Not only do we have Heavens Tower and a consulate, but all the ex-ministers have manors here!${prompt}
  7855: When the ministers of the five magic ministries of Windurst retire, they gain the title of doctor or professor, and are allowed to live in special-wecial houses so they can continue their studies without worries.${prompt}
  7856: Oh, no! That old gent those groupies call the “Great Teacher” has started up his speech again. I swear, my ears are suffering from repetitive strain injury from listening to him repeat the same old thing every time I have the misfortune of passing by here.${prompt}
  7857: The great summoner Karaha-Baruha is the savior of Windurst. Just when we were completely surrounded by beastmen and faced certain doom, BAM!, he instantaneously blew them all away.${prompt}
  7858: If it weren't for him, we Windurstians would have all been goners! A summoner is really someone, huh?${prompt}
  7859: I hear that the beastmen are on the move in every region lately. Even though Windurst has amicable relations with our local beastmen, the Yagudo, we still can't be sure if or when we are going to get pulled back into a full-scale war.${prompt}
  7860: That we can now live here in peace...under the blessed shadow of the Great Star Tree...is all thanks to the great hero, Karaha-Baruha...!${prompt}
  7861: Let the name of the great hero, Karaha-Baruha, not be forgotten! May we exalt the name of Karaha-Baruha on high!${prompt}
  7862: Our Federation of Windurst is governed-woverned by the great Star Sibyl and the five ministries of magic.${prompt}
  7863: Major decisions are made by the five ministers who head the ministries, but the divinations of the Star Sibyl are the most important determinant.${prompt}
  7864: It was a courageous decision by the Star Sibyl when she set out to make friends with the beastmen. It was because of her actions that we are now able to restore Windurst to the beautaruful place it once was.${prompt}
  7865: |-
    Glory to Windurst!
    Glory to the great Star Sibyl!
    May this peace continue for ever and ever!${prompt}
  7866: That place called Giddeus where all them Yagudo beastmen live and dwell is downright dangerous! If you take one wrong step, then it's bishy-bashy, cracky-whacky, and crunchy-munchy!${prompt}
  7867: Come on! The beastmen have been fighting and slighting with Windurst for hundreds of years! How can anyone expect them to suddenly become all cute-and-cuddly or lovey-dovey?${prompt}
  7868: The Star Sibyl permitted the Yagudo beastmen to live in Sarutabaruta. Thataru's why there is a Yagudo nest called Giddeus out in West Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  7869: But the Yagudo don'taru seem the least bit thankful. Annoying, isn'taru it?${prompt}
  7870: Why are there so many hot-blooded Mithra? They shouldn't worry so much about winning or losing-wosing.${prompt}
  7871: |-
    What's done is done.
    Don't you think-wink that it's better to forget the past and concentrate on improving your relationships with others now?${prompt}
  7872: Doctor Shantotto, the former Minister of the Orastery, or “Mage Academy,” lives in this house here. I'm sure that she's hiding something-womething!${prompt}
  7873: Who am I? Well, I'm the reporter who's waiting to get a tell-all interview with her! You see, I write for the Tarutaru Times' “Magic Paradise Weekly.”${prompt}
  7874: They say old Doc Shantotto's as high-and-mighty as Yutungah's firey mountain, and as rough-cut as the rocky Gustaberg Ranges-wanges.${prompt}
  7875: I guess it was wrong of me to start off by interviewing the people around her. The more I hear about the doctor, the less I want to meet her-wer.${prompt}
  7876: That building up there-o-ere is a foreign country's consulate. There is an agreement between Windurst and the other countries that they help each other out when they are in trouble-o-rouble.${prompt}
  7877: So I don't see why we need-o-eed consulates or embassies. If someone is in trouble, we should be helping them out regardless of whether they are Windurstian or not-o-wot!${prompt}
  7878: I feel so sorry for nasty old Zonpa-Zippa's daughter, Miss Apururu. With a father like thaty-watty, not to mention that horrible-worrible brother of hers...! Well, it just goes to show that you suffer-wuffer your whole life when you come from a bad family.${prompt}
  7879: The professor thataru lived in this manor was kidnapped several years ago by those automaton guard creations of his that he named “Cardians.” No one's heard anything of him since the day he was spirited away.${prompt}
  7880: But it serves him rightaru, as that professor was the biggest liar Windurst ever knew. He's probably in the stomach of some nut-headed Cardian by now...or at leastaru one can hope.${prompt}
  7881: We lost all too many-wany loved ones during the Great War, two decades ago.${prompt}
  7882: However, the Great Star Tree and the Star Sibyl survived unharmed, so we Windurstians were able to rebuild our lives without losing all hopey-wopey.${prompt}
  7883: The Star Tree is like a guardian angel-wangel, who, together with the Star Sibyl, looks after Windurst and the Tarutaru who dwell herey-werey.${prompt}
  7884: My heart feels at peacey-weacey whenever I pray to the Great Star Tree, as I am doing now.${prompt}
  7885: Have you ever heard-weard about the great summoner, Karaha-Baruha, who saved Windurst twenty years back?${prompt}
  7886: See the empty house on the hill here? That's the manor where the genius-wenius was supposed to live after he retired as Minister of the Optistery. The town's children think it's haunted-waunted and call it the “ghosty house.”${prompt}
  7887: |-
    Whataru? Don'taru tell me someone is searching for us already?
    Oh...? Phew...! Don'taru you dare tell head lady-in-waiting Zubaba about it, butaru, we sortaru of snuck outaru of Heavens Tower for a bitaru.${prompt}
  7888: Lately the Star Sibyl's divinations have been a little off the marky-warky. Of coursey-woursey, this has put the head lady-in-waiting in rather a bad mood, to say the leasty-weasty. It's simply dreadful-weadful!${prompt}
  7889: My dream is to become a lady-in-waiting and serve the Star Sibyl, but I keep getting turned down by the head lady-in-waiting every time I ask for an interview. How dare she keep me waiting like this with those silly excuses of hers!${prompt}
  7890: |-
    Flibbertigibbet, my word!
    What's wrong with a little gossiping, anyway? Actually, I think my spreading of information is a vital community service. Wouldn't you agree?${prompt}
  7891: Gee... May the Goddess help us if a gossiper-wossiper like Ms. Mehruru ever became-ewame a lady-in-waiting. There'd be no secrets-wecrets left in Heavens Tower-wower!${prompt}
  7892: The Star Reading ceremony is a special rite that entails the gathering of the five ministers and the Star Sibyl together to listen-wisten to the will of the stars in the skies above. The last Star Reading said that Windurst would have everlasting peace-weace.${prompt}
  7893: I'm just glad-wad we didn't have an ill-boding omen come up, like the ones we got during the Great War twenty years ago.${prompt}
  7894: Ithn't it biggy-wiggy? Ithn't it hugey-wugey? Can you thee it? Can you thee it? That'th the “Great Thtar Tree” that grew-and-grew out of and all over Heaventh Tower!${prompt}
  7895: It grew thith big thankth to the magical blething of the thtars in the thky! I with they would help me grow up big thoon too!${prompt}
  7896: Sorry-dorry! I'm in the middle of escorting a researcher from the Rhinostery's bio lab around here. But gee-weez, I sure wish he didn't have to come at such a busy time as this. <mumble-grumble>${prompt}
  7897: Hmm... Tsk-tsk... This is more serious-derious than I thought-dought...${prompt}
  7898: |-
    ...Ah? ...Oh! ...Huh?
    If you're looking-dooking for the entrance to Heavens Tower, it's on the other side-dide of this poor old star tree that encases it.${prompt}
  7899: After years of trying, I was finally given the privilege of serving the Star Sibyl, but I gotaru fired for being too clumsy and a scatterbrain.${prompt}
  7900: |-
    Now I don'taru know whataru to do-woo!
    How can I ever face my mother and father, my brothers and sisters, or my grandfather or grandmother ever again? Oh, and then there's my cousins and my friends, and my family's friends, and their friends' friends and...${prompt}
  7901: Come on, Professorrr Koru-Moru. I'm not moving until you cough up the gil forrr yourrr overdue accounts at the Boneworkers' Guild. As both a ministerrr and the principal of our local school, shouldn't you be setting a betterrr example?${prompt}
  7902: If you need to enter Heavens Tower, then you'll have to crrross that bridge over there. Look around you, and you'll realize that the ruins of the once-grrreat walls of Windurst are prrractically filled with water.${prompt}
  7903: It was twenty years ago, during the Grrreat War, when the walls were destroyed and the place became flooded. But betterrr to have an abundance of waterrr than none at all, eh?${prompt}
  7904: When I was just a kitten, the Star Sibyl came out and gave a speech to everrrybody.${prompt}
  7905: 'She said two things: that we should all play nice with the beastmen, and that nobody could use summonimoning magic anymorrre. What''s summonimoning magic?${prompt}'
  7906: I'm looking for baddie-waddies. When I catch 'em, I throw 'em in a scary-wary jail.${prompt}
  7907: You're not doing anything bad, are you? If you are, you have to tell me, you know!${prompt}
  7908: I'm sure you've seen the automaton guards positioned all around Windurrrst. You had better take carrre when dealing with those Cardians.${prompt}
  7909: This is just between you and me, but those machines go crrrazy sometimes. I've even heard that there have been Tarutaru kidnapped by the malfunctioning Carrrdians!${prompt}
  7910: |-
    <Hiss!>
    Get out of herrre.${prompt}
  7911: We kids keep our tails out of you adults' business, so you keep your big noses out of ourrrs!${prompt}
  7912: Not only the Star Sibyl lives in Heavens Towerrr. Her ladies-in-waiting and the Mithra Sibyl Guards also serrrve her there.${prompt}
  7913: Out of all the guards protecting the Star Sibyl, Semih Lafihna is the most powerrrful. And why shouldn't she be? She is the only Mithra worrrthy enough to accept our chieftainness's bow.${prompt}
  7914: I came herrre to give that Star Sibyl a piece of my mind! Why do we have to be frrriends with those filthy Yagudo?${prompt}
  7915: They continue rrravaging the countryside just because no one herrre in Windurst has the guts to stand up to them!${prompt}
  7916: Twenty yearrrs ago, the allied forrrces succeeded in defeating the lord of the beastmen. Howeverrr, they were not able to take the beastman forces out completely.${prompt}
  7917: If Windurst had only a little more powerrr then, we could have taken care of our birrrd problem, and there would be no need to fake a happy coexistence with the Yagudo.${prompt}
  7918: |-
    Gnyah ha ha!
    What a mighty queer country this here Windurst is! The people are smaller than dogs and the trees are as big as mountains.${prompt}
  7919: And that big honkin' thing over yonder... They say that some star-lady is all living up in there. I wonder if she's into sophisty-cated guys like yours truly.${prompt}
  7920: It's just lovely here, away from the smoke and bustle of Bastok. Take a deep breath and smell that fresh air.${prompt}
  7921: Whenever I need to relax, I just kick back and take in the scenery.${prompt}
  7922: I heard from that consulate over there that Windurst has formed a peace pact with the Yagudo.${prompt}
  7923: Can you believe it? Have they already forgot what happened twenty years ago?${prompt}
  7924: Hmm... I was just talking to Aromu-Oromu here about the Windurstian government.${prompt}
  7925: Can you believe that all the goings-on in this country are decided by the Star Sibyl's fortune-telling? They say that it's tradition, but I just don't see the logic in it...${prompt}
  7926: Howdy-dowdy! You're in Windurst Walls, ${choice-player-gender}[buddy/missy]. I can warp you to Port Windurst if you want me to!${prompt}
  7927: |-
    Warp to Port Windurst?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  7928: Have you already been inside Heavens Tower? I came all the way here to see this strange spring inside. They say you can see the stars in it.${prompt}
  7929: The Star Reading ceremony is a special rite that entails the gathering of the five ministers and the Star Sibyl together to listen-wisten to the will of the stars in the skies above.${prompt}

    Welcome to the auction house.
    Do you have any questions about our establishment?${prompt}
  7970: |-
    What do you want to know?
    ${selection-lines}
    What is the auction house?
    How are auctions run?
    Are there any fees?
    Are there any limits?
    How do you check up on merchandise?
    How do you remove an item?
    My “Sales Status” list is full!
    Nothing right now.${prompt}
  7971: Auction houses can be found in all of Vana'diel's major cities. Here adventurers gather to bid on battle spoils, unwanted items, old armor...almost anything.${prompt}
  7972: Currently, the auction houses in Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno all work independently. Therefore, prices differ from city to city.${prompt}
  7973: Adventurers may use any auction house regardless of nationality.${prompt}
  7974: The first adventurer to bid at or above the asking price will automatically purchase the product.${prompt}
  7975: Once put up for auction, merchandise will remain there for a maximum of thirty weeks Vana'diel time (nine-and-a-half days Earth time).${prompt}
  7976: If merchandise does not sell within this time limit, it will be returned to the seller's current residence.${prompt}
  7977: Transaction fees are proportional to the amount for which an item is put up on auction. The method of calculating this fee is different for single items and stackable items.${prompt}
  7978: A transaction fee is collected when any merchandise is put up for auction. This fee is nonrefundable.${prompt}
  7979: The International Auction House Committee, or IAHC, has declared that a maximum of seven items may be put up for auction at one time.${prompt}
  7980: However, the IAHC has recently removed the limit to how many items one may purchase.${prompt}
  7981: A small amount of time is required before new merchandise appears on our bid list.${prompt}
  7982: Once an item appears on your “Sales Status” list, it may not immediately appear on the bid list. If you do not see your item on the bid list, try looking again at a later time.${prompt}
  7983: If you would like to withdraw an item from an auction, you must travel to the auction house, and select “Stop Sale” from the “Sales Status” menu.${prompt}
  7984: To remove an item from your “Sales Status” list, you must visit an auction counter to acknowledge the sale or return of your merchandise.${prompt}
  7985: Otherwise, previously sold or returned items will fill up your list and prevent you from selling any more merchandise.${prompt}
  7986: At any auction counter, open the “Sales Status” menu and acknowledge the transaction to clear it from the list.${prompt}
  7987: Press the confirm button to remove any transaction colored yellow (sold) or red (returned).${prompt}
  7988: Is there anything else you would like to know?${prompt}
  7989: In the past, many have amassed great wealth through the auction house. I hope you find fortune, too!${prompt}
  7990: You receive nothing from the moon rabbit...${prompt}
  7991: The moon rabbit has brought along a monster!${prompt}

    The effects of controlling regions.
    Regions controlled by other nations.
    Regions under beastman control.${prompt}
  8299: All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt}
  8300: Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt}
  8301: Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt}
  8302: So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt}
  8303: |-
    Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.
    They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt}
  8304: Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt}
  8305: Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt}
  8306: |-
    So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.
    We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt}
  8307: |-
    You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.
    Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt}
  8308: |-
    Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.
    The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt}

    You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  8310: |-
    We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  8311: |-
    You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.
    Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt}
  8312: Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt}
  8313: |-
    You also receive rank points for completing missions.
    Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt}
  8314: |-
    You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.
    Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}
  8315: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt}
  8316: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt}
  8317: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt}
  8318: Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt}
  8319: Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt}
  8320: Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt}
  8321: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt}
  8322: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt}
  8323: |-
    Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.
    If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt}
  8324: If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt}
  8325: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt}
  8326: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt}
  8327: There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt}
  8328: |-
    Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.
    Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.${prompt}

    I saw an adventurer passing throughy the Priming Gate here in Windurst Walls.${prompt}
  8677: |-
    The Cardian guard justaruy let him throughy without a wordy. I guess thataruy means he had permission from Heavens Tower.
    I don'taruy really know, thoughy.${prompt}
  8678: I've been thinking that the Star Sibyl must have some kind of strrrategy in mind for dealing with those treacherous Yagudo.${prompt}
  8679: This whole “Okay, here's your tribute!” facade is just a stalling tactic. Or at least, that's what I'd like to think.${prompt}
  8680: The Minister of the Orastery, Ajido-Marujido, has issued a mission specifically for you.${prompt}
  8681: |-
    I don'taru really like to say it, but...
    From where I stand, it looks as if he is in some sort of conflictaru with Heavens Tower.${prompt}

  8683: Minister Ajido-Marujido awaitarus you in the Orastery.${prompt}
  8684: |-
    It's notaru my place to interfere, but...
    Please be careful notaru step on anyone's toesy-wosies.${prompt}

    Minister Ajido-Marujido has asked for you? My condolences.

    Ergh... Why, diddly-doodley, do you bother me?
    I was just cornering an evil wizard by the bank of a black stagnant pond...${prompt}

    Positively shocking.
    Did you hear aboutaru Minister Ajido-Marujido?${prompt}
  8692: How many years has it been since someone was incarceratarued in the Dark Dungeon?${prompt}
  8693: Apparentaruly, an adventurer was with Minister Ajido-Marujido when he was caughtaru.${prompt}
  8694: Should that adventurer be sharing the blame, I wonder?${prompt}
  8695: Anyway, leaving that talk aside, you have been summoned by the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  8696: Please proceed into Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  8697: There is a summons for you from the Star Sibyl. Please proceed directaruly into Heavens Tower.${prompt}

  8699: |-
    The D-Dark D-Dungeon!
    Brrr, brrr, brrr!${prompt}
  8700: I would rather becomey a guard in Windurst Woods than be throwny in there!${prompt}
  8701: Even if he is Minister of the Orastery, Ajido-Marujido cannot be forgiven his transgressions. The word of Heavens Tower is the law of Windurst.${prompt}
  8702: |-
    With Ajido-Marujido in the Dark Dungeon, who will become the next Minister of the Orastery? It will have to be a super-dooper wizard who can coordinate both the mighty-fighty War Warlocks and the Operations Division.
    ...Nobody really spring-pings to mind.${prompt}
  8703: |-
    What did you just say?
    You wanna try rrrepeating that?${prompt}
  8704: I've been hearing rumors from Miss Kupipi. Sounds like you've been through a tough time.${prompt}
  8705: Luckily, this nextaru mission from the Optistery is a little easier. They wantaru you to help with tidying up the book vault, so it should be a walk in the park for you.${prompt}
  8706: But to ask a rank seven adventurer to help them... It may be thataru there's more to this mission than meets the eye.${prompt}
  8707: The Optistery has issued a mission for a book vault tidy-up. You've acceptarued missions from the Optistery before, haven'taru you?${prompt}
  8708: They seem to have been impressed with you. It's very rare for the Optistery to ask for an adventurer by name.${prompt}
  8709: I havetaru clean my house, too. Adventurers have it easy, since they have moogles to look after their rooms. I'm so jealous-bealous.${prompt}
  8710: I've heard that if adventurers put furniture in their rooms, the moogles sometimes find hidden items. Lucky-duckies!${prompt}
  8711: Have you heardy of the great genius Karaha-Baruha? Karaha-Baruha was the previous Minister of the Optistery.${prompt}
  8712: In the northy of Windurst Walls you can find the House of the Hero. That is where the Ministers of the Optistery livey when they retirey. It's where Karaha-Baruha would have been livingy...${prompt}
  8713: I was told a lot of stories about the Grrreat War as a child, but only those that centered on Chieftainness Perih Vashai.${prompt}
  8714: Although I did hear a story that Windurst was saved by a grrreat light that flowed out from the magic towers. I wonder what could've caused that light?${prompt}
  8715: Are you acquaintarued with Minister Rukususu of the Rhinostery? The nextaru mission is from her ministry.${prompt}
  8716: |-
    All it says here is that the Rhinostery is looking for your help.
    Please ask Leepe-Hoppe on the second floor of the Rhinostery for the details of the mission.${prompt}
  8717: They seem to be in a quite a fluster-wuster, so please hurry on over to the Rhinostery.${prompt}
  8718: The Rhinostery is a research facility where they study all living things. They have a greataru number of researchers scattered all over Vana'diel carrying on various investigations.${prompt}
  8719: It's a difficult field, but as Yoran-Oran always says, “There's nothing-ethy like the feeling of solving-ethy the world's little mysteries.”${prompt}
  8720: |-
    Were you listening properly-doperly?
    You need to go ask the mission-fission details from Leepe-Hoppe on the second floor of the Rhinostery.${prompt}
  8721: |-
    The Rhinostery probably wants you to help them with their research...
    They usually have their own adventurers to assist-list them though.${prompt}
  8722: Speaking of the Rhinostery, how's Miss Kerutoto?${prompt}
  8723: From the time she was a tiny Tarutaru, Kerutoto would come outy with the most frighteningy things all of a sudden. Such a strange little poppet.${prompt}
  8724: The Rhinostery? They have a long history with the Mithra.${prompt}
  8725: |-
    Didn't you know?
    The first Tarutaru to visit us in our southern homeland were researchers from the Rhinostery.${prompt}
  8726: |-
    Wowy-wow, you've reached rank eightaru already?
    Congratulations on your promotion.${prompt}
  8727: Your nextaru mission has been issued by the Aurastery. Please ask the teachers at the School of Magic for the details.${prompt}
  8728: This is a mission from the Aurastery, which basically means a mission from the School of Magic. Please talk to the teachers in the staff room.${prompt}
  8729: |-
    Principal Koru-Moru resides in Windurst Walls, but...
    There probably wouldn't be much pointaru in asking him about the mission.${prompt}
  8730: Out of the five ministries, the Aurastery issues the least mission-bissions.${prompt}
  8731: |-
    When Professor Koru-Moru was actively performing his role as principal, there was all manner of trouble-bubbles...
    But these days it's been relatively quiet.${prompt}
  8732: I never went to schooly. But with all my intense training-waining, I've become a top-notchy guard.${prompt}
  8733: I've even made friends with this Mithra lady-wady. All as a result of my hard worky and discipline!${prompt}
  8734: |-
    I've just given in.
    Every time I talk to these little Tarutaru, I just can't seem to keep the edge on my words. I've lost my bite completely.${prompt}
  8735: Maybe I need to focus myself and rrredo my basic training...${prompt}
  8736: |-
    Firstaru, I must get you to promise something.
    You can't say anything aboutaru this mission to anyone.${prompt}
  8737: This is a mission from Minister Apururu of the Manustery, but it hasn't been submitted to the Sibyl Guards for approval.${prompt}
  8738: |-
    It's not very likely that the Sibyl Guards would allow this mission to be issued...
    After a lengthy discussion-wussion amongst the gatehouse guards, we decided to keep it quiet from them for the sake of Minister Apururu.${prompt}
  8739: Please make your way to the Manustery. Minister Apururu is waiting for you.${prompt}
  8740: |-
    This is a mission from Minister Apururu of the Manustery.
    Please take care not to blabby-wab to anyone about it.${prompt}
  8741: Please hurry to the Manustery and keep a look out for any Sibyl Guards sniffing around.${prompt}
  8742: After the Great War twenty years ago, the Cardians started a rebellion-mellion and carried off the previous Manustery minister...${prompt}
  8743: Following that chaos, the Manustery came to a complete standstill. Minister Apururu has worked extremely-zemely hard to get her ministry back into operation.${prompt}
  8744: The Cardians created by the Manustery are made to act as shields for the guards. It's time we returned the favor!${prompt}
  8745: Our biggest worry was Captain Rakoh Buuma in Windurst Woods. Being a Mithra, I didn'taru think she would understandy our desirey to help Minister Apururu.${prompt}
  8746: But she was all for it! Now I think Mithra are the cat's pajamas!${prompt}
  8747: I don't want to burst their bubble, but I think the reason Captain Buuma is helping the Tarutaru is because she wants to tick off the Sibyl Guards.${prompt}
  8748: '...I  Have  Waited  For  You,  ${name-player}.${prompt}'
  8749: |-
    I  Know  Why  You  Are  Here.
    You  Have  Come  To  Take  My  Mana  Orb.${prompt}
  8750: It  Is  Normal  For  A  Cardian  To  Die  For  His  Master.${prompt}
  8751: |-
    But  I  Am  Not  Willing  To  Die.
    Why  Is  That?${prompt}
  8752: I  Don't  Know  What  It  Is,  But  There  Is  Something  I  Must  Do.${prompt}
  8753: |-
    It  Is  Very  Important.
    I  Must  Do  This  Thing  Even  If  It  Means  Defying  My  Master.${prompt}
  8754: '...Please  Help  Me  Search  For  The  Answer.${prompt}'
  8755: I  Believe  That  Answer  Will  Be  Found  In  Torai-Marai  Canal.${prompt}
  8756: Please  Search  Torai-Marai  Canal  In  My  Place.  Find  What  I  Am  Looking  For.${prompt}
  8757: 'You give the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} to Joker...'
  8758: |-
    Yes... I understand now.
    I know who I am. I know why I am here.${prompt}
  8759: I know that there is something I must do.${prompt}
  8760: |-
    I must see.
    I must see what has become of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  8761: |-
    And I must know.
    I must know what I need to do, and what path I need to take.${prompt}
  8762: |-
    And so, ${name-player},
    I cannot allow you to disassemble me as Honoi-Gomoi has asked you.${prompt}
  8763: |-
    I offer this to you.
    I ask you to accept this from me and refuse the request from Honoi-Gomoi to take me apart.${prompt}
  8764: |-
    Accept the offer?
    ${selection-lines}
    When you put it that way...
    The hammer or the axe?${prompt}
  8765: |-
    ...Please understand.
    If you try to carry out his request, then I must disassemble you. I ask you again, please just accept this.${prompt}
  8766: |-
    ...${name-player}.
    ...Thank you...${wait-animation: 2}
  8767: |-
    ...Hello?
    ${name-player}?${prompt}
  8768: |-
    What are you doing here?
    This is the house of the great genius Karaha-Baruha.
    Well, to be perfectaruly accurate, this would have been his house...${prompt}
  8769: Someone was saying they had seen a Cardian lurking around here, so I came to check it out for myself.${prompt}
  8770: |-
    We can have a look around together!
    I'd feel much safer with a mighty-wighty adventurer like you to accompany me!${prompt}
  8771: What's that you've got there?${prompt}
  8772: It looks like one of the boxes used to store Cardians.${prompt}
  8773: It must be one of the old Cardians if it's being kept here. I wonder if it's one of the models my father made twenty years ago...${prompt}
  8774: Oh, there's something written here. Let's see now, “...to Toraimarai Canal...”?${prompt}
  8775: |-
    Toraimarai Canal?
    Does that mean that the Cardian from this box has some connection with that place?${prompt}
  8776: |-
    Adventurer, would you go and search Toraimarai Canal for me?
    You may be able to find some clues to solve this little mystery!${prompt}
  8777: If you find anything even the leastaru bit strange I want you to bring it to me at the Manustery. I'm very curious-wurious about the events of twenty years ago!${prompt}
  8778: If you find anything even the leastaru bit strange I want you to bring it to me at the Manustery. I'm very curious-wurious about the events of twenty years ago!${prompt}
  8779: |-
    ...Hm?
    Just a momentaru. What's that you have there?${prompt}
  8780: |-
    This is...
    This is a terribly-werribly old Cardian card...${prompt}
  8781: But there's something strange about it. There's no mark, just this odd-bodd picture. I can't sense any magic from it, either.${prompt}
  8782: How unusual. Ordinarily, Cardian cards are imbued with powerful magic.${prompt}
  8783: The Cardian cards were a creation of my father, the previous Minister of the Manustery. The holder of the card could use it to remove the magic animating the card's respective Cardian.${prompt}
  8784: Do you understand the ramifications of this? The older Cardians could use the cards in their possession to deactivate other Cardians.${prompt}
  8785: '...My father had essentially made it possible for Cardians to kill each other, just like people can. Isn''t that horrible-worrible...?${prompt}'
  8786: |-
    Ah, forgive me!
    I seem to have drifted onto a darker topic.
    Enough of that, back to this card!${prompt}
  8787: This card holds no power over its respective Cardian. Which means it's most likely just a reject.${prompt}
  8788: |-
    Either that...or it could be...
    This card has no respective Cardian?
    That would mean that this is a unique card...${prompt}
  8789: |-
    ${name-player}, please let me buy this card off you!
    I'm sure there's more to this than meets the eye!${prompt}

    ...Oh, ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}!
    You have Rhinostery authorization-nation.${prompt}
  8794: '...I heard aboutaru the theory that the withering-dithering of the Star Tree is caused by insects chewing-zewing on the roots.${prompt}'
  8795: We'll leave the extermination-termination of the bugs in your capable hands.${prompt}
  8796: '...Yes, I heard-ethy the whole story from one of the young lads from the Rhinostery. Toraimarai Canal may be infested-ethy with starmites, he said.${prompt}'
  8797: |-
    That's my Rhinostery!
    Those young ones took-ethy fastaru and appropriataru action for the situation at hand. Coming to me for help-ethy was the right decision...${prompt}
  8798: It's a critical situation, but working-ethy under pressure is one of the thrills of research, ha-ha-ha!${prompt}
  8799: I'm making-ethy progress on my research into starmites, thanks in partaru to the information I had gathered-ethy on mandragoras. You see, all living things are connected.${prompt}
  8800: 'You should-ethy remember this from time to time: You are connected-ethy to all other beings in Vana''diel.${prompt}'
  8801: |-
    Pass through the gate?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  8802: |-
    Enter the gate?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  8803: |-
    You said something!?
    You've collected all five of the minister rings!?${prompt}
  8804: |-
    ...Well, well, well.
    I never believed you would actually get them all.
    Come on then, let's have a look at them, don't stall.${prompt}
  8805: |-
    This ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} is worthless.
    It looks like ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} from an older age, more or less.${prompt}
  8806: |-
    This mission will create quite a stir.
    We must involve Minister Apururu and all the ministers.${prompt}
  8807: |-
    The Minister of the Optistery is the oldest and most stubborn of the lot.
    Make sure you get the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} from that old crack-pot.${prompt}
  8808: |-
    ...You've done well.
    But the fact that a ragtag adventurer such as you could bring together all five rings...
    Something about that just chills my bones and makes me cringe.${prompt}
  8809: This undertaking will most likely leave a mark on Windurst's history.${prompt}
  8810: And now that we have all of the ministers in on the act, Apururu won't have to shoulder all the blame, will she?${prompt}
  8811: |-
    ...Right, then.
    Let's complete the final preparations.${prompt}
  8812: Hocus-pocus circularum-focus!${prompt}
  8813: |-
    Ohohoho!
    Behold, the forbidden ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}!
    Now all that's left is for you to take this to Apururu.${prompt}
  8814: |-
    Wearing all five ministry rings at once is something I wouldn't recommend.
    The combined power consumes your body and you go up in flames--meaning your end.${prompt}
  8815: |-
    To prevent this, I have created the ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.
    I've always wanted to try out this power for myself, but Karaha-Baruha would never lend me his ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}...${prompt}
  8816: |-
    Ooh! Just thinking about that makes me want to lash out and curse someone!
    If only I'd had that ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} back then... Oh, what I would have done!${prompt}
  8817: |-
    This mission will create quite a stir.
    We must involve Minister Apururu and all the ministers.${prompt}
  8818: |-
    The Minister of the Optistery is the oldest and most stubborn of the lot.
    Make sure you get the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} from that old crack-pot.${prompt}
  8819: |-
    Ohohohoho!
    It looks like my ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]} had the desired effect!${prompt}
  8820: Ajido-Marujido's failure to regain consciousness is the only slight complication I was able to detect...${prompt}
  8821: |-
    But you don't need to go and start worrying.
    Why, it would take more than that to finish off a mage that had survived my tutelage and training!${prompt}
  8822: '...Now, about the ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.${prompt}'
  8823: |-
    Due to a slight miscalculation on my part, the rings have become fused to the glove, I see.
    But don't worry. With a few twists, I'll soon have them free.${prompt}
  8824: I'll just hold on to the ministry rings for a little while longer. Ohohoho!${prompt}
  8825: A blue energy wells up within you...!
  8826: '...The energy that pours down from on high, flowing over the victors of the challenge...${prompt}'
  8827: |-
    Have you not noticed, ${name-player}?
    The energy that filled you has been stolen.${prompt}
  8828: ${name-player}, look within yourself. The energy that had been granted to you and your adventurer brethren has been stolen.${prompt}
  8829: My gaze sweeps the world, and I have glimpsed the plunderer of that power.${prompt}
  8830: |-
    A detestable puppet.
    Cursed prayer. Warped logic...
    The common people stand in the center of that maelstrom.${prompt}
  8831: |-
    Yes...
    Now, in the western city of Bastok...${prompt}
  8832: You remember the voice of Carbuncle.${prompt}
  8833: |-
    ...What diddly-doodley can I do for you?
    You met a slam-dangly talented Tarutaru named Ildy-Goldy in Bastok, and he wants you to ask me about Uran-Mafran?${prompt}
  8834: |-
    Not sure I can hip-helpily help you.
    I only remember the name-a-roonies of the cute girls who are connected with my research.${prompt}
  8835: |-
    Uran-Mafran, Uran-Mafran...
    I'm sure I've heard that name around-a-doodily somewhere before.${prompt}
  8836: |-
    Argh!
    I just can't remembereeno!${prompt}
  8837: If you give me a little more time to think-dinkily-dink, you can have this. I get asked to do-a-diddy-do so many things, my brain is fit to bang-bustingly-burst!${prompt}
  8838: |-
    ...Ergh!
    Just give me a little more time-a-rime. I get asked to do-a-diddy-do so many things at once, my brain is fit to bang-bustingly-burst!${prompt}
  8839: |-
    ...Quickly...
    The stolen energy grows in strength...${prompt}
  8840: If my humble power can be the key to open the rusted door of memories...${prompt}
  8841: |-
    ...Diddly-darn it!
    I don't get it...
    How do I complete this...?${prompt}
  8842: |-
    Hmm...? Can I help you...?
    Right now I'm riding the train-areeno of depression into the wall of frustration.${prompt}
  8843: At this rate, Professor Shantotto will...${prompt}
  8844: 'The ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} falls to the ground and sparkles brilliantly.'
  8845: Ah, that light!${prompt}
  8846: |-
    ...Ah!
    That's it!${prompt}
  8847: |-
    Bring me four ${item-plural: 2[2]}! That's the key!
    The solution to my problem is at hand-aroony.${prompt}
  8848: |-
    Back already?
    You adventurer-types know your stuff.${prompt}
  8849: |-
    Now it's diddly-down to business.
    With these, I should be able to...${wait-animation: 2}
  8850: <groan>...${prompt}
  8851: This shouldn't have...${prompt}
  8852: |-
    Wait!
    I just remembered something!${prompt}
  8853: |-
    Yes, it was diddly-definitely...
    Uran-Mafran was a student in the advanced class-aroo when I was still actively working as the Principal of the School of Magic.${prompt}
  8854: He was an exceptional student with impeccable test results and a bright-ariffic future. The other students called him the “Puppet Master.”${prompt}
  8855: At that time, the pre-prep-position of Manustery minister was viddily-vacant, with Minister Zonpa-Zippa having been abduc-tapily-ducted by the rogue Cardians...${prompt}
  8856: Apururu, the current Minister of the Manustery, and her brother-eeno, Ajido-Marujido, were still just children.${prompt}
  8857: And so I chose two stoop-stupily-students from the advanced-diddily-do class. Before they graduated, I had to doo-diddly-decide which would become the new Manustery minister.${prompt}
  8858: One of those students was the person you mentioned, Uran-Mafran.${prompt}
  8859: |-
    However...
    The reason I didn't rang-dangly-remember him was because he suddenly uppity-up and disappeared not long after becoming the Minister of the Manustery.${prompt}
  8860: On top of that, Uran-Mafran used a mojo-mad-magic doll to erase all memories of himself from the people of Windurst before he left. That kind of enchantment-aroony is strictly forbidden-areeno...${prompt}
  8861: Principal Koru-Moru!
  8862: Principal Koru-Moru!${prompt}
  8863: |-
    Well, dang-diddly-doodily!
    Ildy-Goldy and Rukususu!?${prompt}
  8864: Have you heard zee whole story from zis adventurer? Uran-Mafran has been seen lurking around near zee protocrystals zat are zee current study topic of zee Rhinosterie.${prompt}
  8865: That svine is up to no good. He's using a magic doll to manipulate-vate a constant stream of adventurers into entering the crystals.${prompt}
  8866: |-
    Hold on, hold on!
    I only just manly-managed to remem-demily-member who Uran-Mafran was.${prompt}
  8867: What was that you were chat-tattily-talking about? Those protocrystals? What doodily-do they have inside them?${prompt}
  8868: |-
    Avatars.
    Zey're similar to zee great beast zat used to roam Sarutabaruta on nights of zee full moon.${prompt}
  8869: Avatars are generally in a deep-veep slumber, but if they are approached with the tuning forks created by the Rhinostery, they come raging forth, looking to do battle-vattle.${prompt}
  8870: Oho, how very exciting-ariffic. And if you defeat them in battle-o-rama?${prompt}
  8871: |-
    I don't really know.
    Something is supposed to happen, but I never felt anything...${prompt}
  8872: |-
    Hmmm.
    Curious, very curious indeed-aroony. Ildy-Goldy, you mentioned how Uran-Mafran was manipulating adventurer-eenos with a magic doll...${prompt}
  8873: |-
    Yes.
    But I have no idea vhy. I vould like to ask him about that, but he alvays runs from me.${prompt}
  8874: Hmmm...${prompt}
  8875: |-
    Right, then!
    I have a doot-doot-duty to look out for my students, no matter how old and crumbly-mumbly they get!${prompt}
  8876: First off, we need to inform-aroo the graduates from Uran-Mafran's class of his reappearance. If they've forgotten about him, you must jiggly-jolt their memories!${prompt}
  8877: |-
    Vhat a blast from the past.
    That nagging-vagging old Fuepepe continued on to the Aurastery, didn't she?${prompt}
  8878: And let's see... Furakku-Norakku is probably half-asleep at his desk in the Optistery.${prompt}
  8879: Right. And lastly, zere's the fiery Sunny-Pabonny who went on to zee Orastery just like he wanted.${prompt}
  8880: |-
    Ah, he's Minister Shantotto's... Vait, it's Professor Shantotto now, isn't it?
    Anyvay, Sunny-Pabonny was a hugey-vuge fan of hers, as I recall.${prompt}
  8881: |-
    ...Okey-doodily-day.
    We can leave that task to this adventurereeno.${prompt}
  8882: Go and meet with those three people, and speak to them about Uran-Mafran. They should remember who he is.${prompt}
  8883: |-
    I have a diddly-different job for Rukususu and Ildy-Goldy to do.
    Come this way.${prompt}
  8884: Oui, Principal!${prompt}
  8885: Coming, Principal!${prompt}
  8886: Ildy-Goldy. Rukususu. Fuepepe. Furakku-Norakku. Sunny-Pabonny.${prompt}
  8887: And lastly, Uran-Mafran.${prompt}
  8888: These are the names of all the student-aroos who were in that advanced class. With all the terrible-ariffic goings-on in that generation of students, they became quite a tightly-knit bunch.${prompt}
  8889: You must informly-form my formerly-former students of the reappearance of Uran-Mafran. Unlike me, they should remem-memberly-member who he is.${prompt}
  8890: You want to know where to find Sunny-Pabonny? How am I supposed to know where he is at?${prompt}
  8891: He went off last month... Or was it earlier than that?${prompt}
  8892: Anyway, he went to San d'Oria to find some sort of armor, and I haven't heard from him since.${prompt}
  8893: |-
    Ohohoho!
    He'll show up when you least expect it, I'm convinced.${prompt}
  8894: Everyone is up to ding-dangly-date on the situation? I should think no one had forgotten about Uran-Mafran.${prompt}
  8895: When Uran-Mafran left Windurst, he cast an enchantment that would cause everybod-boddily-body in town to forget about him. However, it had no effect-aroo on my students and me.${prompt}
  8896: If zee principal hadn't shielded us, we too would have forgotten about Uran-Mafran.${prompt}
  8897: Ve really appreciate that, Principal.${prompt}
  8898: I'm terribly flang-diddly-forgetful to start with, so I would have forgotten about him anyway. Ahahaha!${prompt}
  8899: So, Rukususu, Ildy-Goldy. What did you fine-doodily-find out?${prompt}
  8900: Well... I talked to people who were working at zee Manustery at zee time of Uran-Mafran's disappearance, but not one of zem remembered him.${prompt}
  8901: And of course, Apururu and zee other current Manustery staff were not aware of any of zis.${prompt}
  8902: If you defeat the avatars that reside vithin the protocrystals, then you are granted a portion-vortion of that avatar's power.${prompt}
  8903: It appears that Uran-Mafran offers a reward to adventurers who have besty-vested the avatars, and then steals the power that they have gained.${prompt}
  8904: |-
    Hmmm.
    What is Uran-Mafran ping-doodily-planning to do with this power of the avatars...?${prompt}
  8905: |-
    It has me worried.
    You don't think he's going to attempt a...summoning...like Karaha-Baruha did...?${prompt}
  8906: No, Uran-Mafran's power is dang-diddly-delicate and subtle-ariffic. He wouldn't be capable of controlling the avatars...${prompt}
  8907: I wonder if this has any connection-aroo with his sudden withdrawal-areeno from his position of minister?${prompt}
  8908: '...Principal Koru-Moru, ve need to talk to Uran-Mafran directly. I vill see if I can track him down.${prompt}'
  8909: And I will search for clues in places other zan zee Manustery. I will see what I can find.${prompt}
  8910: |-
    Hmmm.
    I didn't really want to say this, but Uran-Mafran always had the potential to become a destructariffic force.${prompt}
  8911: My student-areenos may be threatened by more than just the loss of their memories. I have this for you, just in case.${prompt}
  8912: The power googily-gained from dip-doodily-defeating an avatar... Why would Uran-Mafran be gathering that energy?${prompt}
  8913: I wonder if this has any connection-aroo to his sudden withdrawal-areeno from the Manustery minister position!${prompt}
  8914: '......${prompt}'
  8915: Help me...${prompt}
  8916: |-
    Oh, it's you.
    Accordily-cording to the staff at the Rhinostery, there's been an incident with one of their researcher-areenos.${prompt}
  8917: |-
    It might be Uran-Mafran's diddily-doing.
    Hurry on over and see what's hap-happily-happened. ${prompt}
  8918: |-
    What the ding-daddily-doodily did you say!?
    Ildy-Goldy's was ensorcelled by some magicified doll, and taken away by Uran-Mafran!?${prompt}
  8919: |-
    That slime-slamming-scoundrel!
    His sense of diddly-decency has completely rot-totily-totted away!${prompt}
  8920: 'Principal Koru-Moru!${wait-animation: 2}'
  8921: I've discovered something very suspicious!${prompt}
  8922: Rukususu!${prompt}
  8923: |-
    What doodily-do you mean, suspicious?
    What did you find out?${prompt}
  8924: Zee only time zee Manustery wasn't in zee red was when Uran-Mafran was minister! It appears zat a trader in Windurst Waters called Honoi-Gomoi was making donations to zee ministry...${prompt}
  8925: |-
    Honoi-Gomoi...!?
    The dang-doodily-descendant of the famous Maelstrom Mage!${prompt}
  8926: Ooooh, I've got a really bad-daddily-dad feeling about this!${prompt}
  8927: |-
    The Manustery and the Maelstrom Mage!
    Uran-Mafran, you black-heart, what evil schemeroo are you half-bakingly hatching!?${prompt}
  8928: Rukususu...adventurer...take this and go. Use it on Ildy-Goldy, and it should bash-bangingly-break whatever spell-aroo Uran-Mafran has over him.${prompt}
  8929: Get out there and fine-diddly-find Uran-Mafran. We must prevent him from using the energy he's stored in that Mana Orb before it's too lateroo...!${prompt}
  8930: |-
    The Manustery and the Maelstrom Mage!
    Uran-Mafran, you black-heart, what evil schemeroo are you half-bakingly hatching!?${prompt}
  8931: |-
    Find Uran-Mafran!
    We must soop-stoopily-stop him from using the piddily-power he's accumulated...!${prompt}
  8932: Did you did-diddily-discover anything?${prompt}
  8933: |-
    Greatily-greatified Goddess!
    Ildy-Goldy! You're okay!${prompt}
  8934: |-
    Oho...!
    You were able to swoopily-swipe the Mana Orb from Uran-Mafran? That takes care of one problem-areeno.${prompt}
  8935: |-
    So this is the Mana Orb he was using.
    There is an awesome power sing-speedingly-seething within...${prompt}
  8936: |-
    Yes, zee intensity is dreadful.
    I cannot even bear to hold zee orb itself.${prompt}
  8937: |-
    Hmm.
    With this kind of power, you could bring a person back from doom-daddily-death's domain.${prompt}
  8938: Bring somevone back to life!?${prompt}
  8939: A spell of resurrection...!?${prompt}
  8940: |-
    Indeedily-doo.
    In everyday circles, it's referred to as the “Legend of the Magic Doll.”${prompt}
  8941: If the creator of a magic doll diddily-dies, that magic doll will lose its magic and passingly perish. By the same logic-aroo, if you were to restore life to the doll, the creator would return from the jaundiced-jagged-jaws of doodily-death.${prompt}
  8942: But this fordiddily-forbidden practice really does exist outside of legend. Only the Manustery minister knows the root-tootin-ritual, and the dark-doodily-details have been a closely-guarded secret for generations. Naturally, the use of this magic-aroo is prohibited, even to the minister.${prompt}
  8943: |-
    I see...it makes sense now.
    Uran-Mafran became Minister of zee Manustery long enough to learn zee ritual, zen left once he had gleaned its secrets...${prompt}
  8944: |-
    But if all that is true...
    Who on Vana'diel is Uran-Mafran trying to resurrect...?${prompt}
  8945: 'Principal...${wait-animation: 2}'
  8946: |-
    ...I know who it is.
    As soon as I heard about Rukususu's discoveroos, I immediately took action.${prompt}
  8947: The dolls of history's great magereenos are stored under heavy-doot-doodily-duty guard in Heavens Tower. After these events, that security has been strengthened even furtheroo.${prompt}
  8948: |-
    Great mages of the past...
    You mean...${prompt}
  8949: |-
    Yes.
    For the moment-aroo, we've foiled Uran-Mafran's ambitions, but you can be sure he won't give up that easily.${prompt}
  8950: Ildy-Goldy, you are the only one who can stand against Uran-Mafran's sorcerer-iffic power. Can I count on you to doodily-do your part?${prompt}
  8951: Of course, Principal.${prompt}
  8952: The Rhinostery researcher-areenos who are under the control of Uran-Mafran pose another problem. I am looking into a solution with the help of Professor Yoran-Oran, but this may take some time...${prompt}
  8953: You have our support, Principal.${prompt}
  8954: And lastly, there is you, adventurer-eeno. By helping us in this matter, you will be poopity-putting yourself in dang-diddly-danger.${prompt}
  8955: |-
    Take this.
    At long last I've com-doodily-completed it... Karaha-Baruha's experimental armor.${prompt}
  8956: "You noodily-need this more than Professor Shantotto does. \nMake shoobidy-sure you look after it.${prompt}"
  8957: Few mages have fallen as far into black-broodily-darkness as Uran-Mafran.${prompt}
  8958: He reminds me of that villain-areeno of the past, the Maelstrom Mage. Sends tingly-shivers down my spine-diddliy-hind.${prompt}
  8959: |-
    I can't stand waiting here, sitting on our hands.
    It's taken months to reconstruct those plans.
    Months to decipher the code.
    Months to journy this far down the road...${prompt}
  8960: How long is it going to take until the brilliant armor designed by Karaha-Baruha is done!?${prompt}
  8961: I'll never forgive Professor Koru-Moru if I'm not the first to try it on!${prompt}
  8962: |-
    ......
    I can't really go into too much detail about this mission right in frontaru of Heavens Tower...${prompt}
  8963: Minister Apururu wants you to hurry over to the Manustery.${prompt}
  8964: It seems that Minister Ajido-Marujido may be on the verge of waking up from his coma...${prompt}
  8965: That mightaru just be hopeful speculation on my part, but Miss Apururu has been seen hurry-scurrying back and forth between Windurst Woods and Windurst Walls.${prompt}
  8966: This is a mission from Minister Apururu of the Manustery. Please keep the details tip-top secret.${prompt}
  8967: Sibyl Guard Semih Lafihna has returned to Heavens Tower, but hopefully she won'taru be visiting the Dark Dungeon any time soon.${prompt}
  8968: According to the gossip-dossip of the ladies-in-waiting, Semih Lafihna has been to-ing and fro-ing all over the place trying to find information on the bearer of darkness that appeared in Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  8969: I was standing rightaru here when all the fuss erupted, and I have no memory-zemory of letting such a creature pass into the tower. It must be some sort of ghosty-toasty...${prompt}
  8970: You gotta hand it to those Mithra. She goes off in search of the thing when most normal people would be running in the other direction. Ghosties give me the shivers...${prompt}
  8971: I've heardy some disturbing rumors. Apparently Doctor Shantotto has been trying all sorts of things to rousey Ajido-Marujido from his slumbery...${prompt}
  8972: The poor minister is probably in much more danger now than when he was languishingy in the Dark Dungeon... I'm terribly-werribly worried for him, but I'm petrifiedy of what I might see if I go to check!${prompt}
  8973: You know, I've been thinking. If the Sibyl Guards are orrrphans of the Great War, then wouldn't they hate the Yagudo even more than us other Mithra?${prompt}
  8974: I suppose that as a race, the Mithra don't hold much with grrrudges. Maybe their anger has cooled off over the years?${prompt}
  8975: Hooray! I never thought that Minister Ajido-Marujido would be forgiven so quickly-trickly for his transgressions!${prompt}
  8976: Were you there when he talked with the Star Sibyl? I heard that Minister Apururu said she has a lot to thank you for!${prompt}
  8977: The Orastery mages are relievedy that Minister Ajido-Marujido will be back to run the ministry just as he always has.${prompt}
  8978: |-
    The boys in Operations were so afraidy that Doctor Shantotto would returny as minister, they started planning out Code E emergency procedures.
    ..Ahahaha...
    ...What? You think they were serious?${prompt}
  8979: Chieftainness Perih Vashai is to seek an audience with the Star Sibyl concerning the events surrounding Orastery minister Ajido-Marujido.${prompt}
  8980: Don't get me wrong--it's not like the chieftainness is a close friend of the minister or anything. These events have set something in motion. And I think we're about to find out what that something is...${prompt}
  8981: I'm worried-ethy about Miss Apururu. I wish I had time to listen-ethy to her woes, but this thesis I'm writing takes up all my waking hours...${prompt}
  8982: It concerns the research-ethy I'm doing on the mandragora that you adventurers have been helping-ethy me with. I've reached the point-ethy where I'm almost ready to publish-ethy my findings.${prompt}
  8983: 'Let me tell you something I''ve discovered in my research. It appears that the Mandragora derive nourishment-ethy from ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  8984: 'They also have a great-ethy love for ${item-plural: 2[2]}, but I have no idea where you might find one.${prompt}'
  8985: |-
    How disappointing.
    Ajido-Marujido woke up on his own before I could think of some new spells to fling.${prompt}
  8986: I'm achy-waking to grill him on what he saw in the Book of the Gods, but I supppose I'll give him some time to recover.${prompt}
  8987: The word “restraint” doesn'taru exist in my dictionary, you'll discover. Ohohoho!${prompt}
  8988: ${name-player}, you have orders to reportaru to Heavens Tower. Those pesky Yagudo are causing trouble again.${prompt}
  8989: There has been a proposal addressed to the Star Sibyl for a revision-wision of the peace treaty between the Yagudo and Windurst.${prompt}
  8990: Each proposal the Yagudo send is more demanding than the lastaru. It's like they're deliberataruly picking a fight with us.${prompt}
  8991: '...With all this going on, how can we say that Windurst is really in a state of peace...? Um, please forget I said that. I was justaru thinking out loud...${prompt}'
  8992: A proposal has been sentaru to Heavens Tower for a revision of the peace treaty between the Yagudo and Windurst.${prompt}
  8993: I justaru can't understand why the Yagudo are being so agressive-wessive. Is this their way of pulling a fastaru one on us?${prompt}
  8994: I heard from the ladies-in-waiting that they haven't seen the Star Sibyl around lately-dately.${prompt}
  8995: You know, with Ajido-Marujido forgiven for his crimes and we guards going unpunished-bunished, I get the feeling that something more importantaru must be going on...${prompt}
  8996: Maybe, just maybe... She's taking a secretaru vacation!? Hmm, not likely, huh...?${prompt}
  8997: Oh, good griefy, the Mithra are getting all firedy up again. You can'taru mentiony the word “Yagudo” around them without sparks flying out of their ears!${prompt}
  8998: Those black-blooded, back-stabbing Yagudo scum! We Mithra should wipe out the entire rrrace!${prompt}
  8999: What is the Star Sibyl afrrraid of? Taking rrresponsiblity for a war? That Windurst would lose?${prompt}
  9000: If fighting brrreaks out on the streets like it did twenty years ago, we should just blast the hell out of 'em with that summoning magic stuff.${prompt}
  9001: I mightaru be a guard for Windurst Walls, but no one loves the entire city of Windurst more than me.${prompt}
  9002: And that is why you have my most sincerest-werest gratitude. I can barely put into words how much I appreciataru what you have done.${prompt}
  9003: I still remember hiding with my mother in Heavens Tower when the war was raging all aboutaru Windurst. I will never forgetaru the scene that met my eyes when I looked back from this spot.${prompt}
  9004: Your adventures may take you to distantaru lands, but please don't forget the gentle breeze, clear blue skies, and beautiful vistas of Windurst.${prompt}
  9005: Lady Zubaba is being all naggy-haggy about the guards helping out with the Dark Dungeon jailbreak.${prompt}
  9006: As soon as she has any free time on her hands, she uses it to picky-stick on other people's faults. I knew it was too good to lastaru...${prompt}
  9007: Oh, ${name-player}! I heardy you were the one who saved the Star Sibyl!${prompt}
  9008: Can I have your autography? It'll become a family heirloom! I'll keepy it locked in a treasure chest!${prompt}
  9009: We Mithra are going to be rrrunning wild in Windurst Woods again, so don't forget to stop by. Oh, and before you go...${prompt}
  9010: '...can I have your autograph?${prompt}'
  9011: |-
    Ah, it's such a waste.
    Such a wonderful glove that can never be replaced.${prompt}
  9012: I would have gladly blasty-wasted a hundred people to keep it mine to use... But since Apururu offered me three years' worth of the Manustery's budgetaru, how could I refuse?${prompt}
  9013: Things have worked out for the bestaru. I'm not even upset that I wasn't called to join the Full Moon Fountain battle.${prompt}
  9014: I'll just weave some curses to give their nerves a little rattle. Ohohohoho!${prompt}

  9152: Gather all four trophies and hurry yourself on to Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia will be waiting for you when you get there. But be wary, ${name-player}. The blackness enveloping that world grows ever deeper, ever darker...${prompt}

    Wait, wait, wait!
    I don't mean that they're currrsed or anything like that! It's something more like, um, not ominous, but...
    How can I explain it?${prompt}
  9156: Anyway! They're not evil, just...you know? Different from other normal swords and things. Being all ghostlike and stuff, you can feel things like that.${prompt}
  9157: |-
    But enough of that kinda talk--congrrratulations are in order!
    You've got your paws on the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! It shows you've got the goods in the hero department, and it will also help you get into Xarcabard.${prompt}
  9158: But first you've got to collect the other three trophies and then hightail it to snowy Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia should be up there waiting for you.${prompt}
  9159: "${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and the four trophies.\nThese artifacts have long been lost to that other world. \nThe Hydra Corps was a unit formed after our expedition to the Northlands.${prompt}"

  9163: |-
    Unless the shroud of darkness is lifted, that power alone will not be enough to open the way.

  9164: Let us make haste to the land where this all began. To Xarcabard...${prompt}
  9165: Is it over...?${prompt}
  9166: No, the rage has merely been dispersed.${prompt}
  9167: As long as I exist, he will never truly die...${prompt}

  9169: |-
    ${name-player}...
    You have achieved an incredible feat--the unification of the Shadow Lord has been prevented.
    I have not the words to express my gratitude.${prompt}
  9170: |-
    The power of the crystal has faded, but I will be drawn into that towering rage no more.
    I have heard the voice of the one who holds sway over this realm...${prompt}
  9171: The one who holds sway...?${prompt}
  9172: |-
    Yes. From the center of infinite darkness.
    I was in a place beyond comprehension when those words reached into my mind...${prompt}
  9173: |-
    You who have touched the crystal, the one who holds immortal power within a mortal shell.
    The rage that has arisen from your twisted core will devour my world.${prompt}
  9174: |-
    It was an error in judgment to shelter you...
    The order of my realm has been disrupted.${prompt}
  9175: |-
    I give to you a duty...
    You will stand vigil until an age without hatred has dawned.${prompt}
  9176: |-
    No matter what terrible power you might wield, there is no escape from Dynamis for an incomplete soul.
    No return to the land of blessed light...${prompt}
  9177: |-
    What manner of being was this who spoke from a pit of blackness?
    As this question gnawed at my mind, the voice grew quiet, leaving me in unanswered silence.${prompt}
  9178: |-
    Of one thing I was certain.
    This voice belonged to the ruler of Dynamis.${prompt}
  9179: A flow of energy exists in Vana'diel that has escaped the notice of those who dwell there.${prompt}
  9180: |-
    Thirty years past, my contact with the crystal caused an accelerated change in this flow.
    It was as if it had leapt forward, rushing along a deliberate course.${prompt}
  9181: |-
    Nobody knows what lies at the end of this journey.
    Perhaps it will reveal the true nature of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  9182: ${name-player}, you may be the one to witness this truth.${prompt}
  9183: |-
    The power stored in the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will soon be drained.
    And I must remain in this world in my role of observer.${prompt}
  9184: |-
    Do not forget who you are, ${name-player}.
    I bid farewell to a most heroic adventurer.${prompt}
  9185: My old companions...?
  9186: |-
    This duty is too much for just one to bear.
    If you will have me, I will stand at your side until an age without hatred has arrived.
    It pains me to see the depths to which my country has fallen.${prompt}
  9187: That is my only reason for staying. Do not misunderstand my motivations.${prompt}
  9188: |-
    Blessed light and the ruler of Dynamis?
    I do believe you've rekindled my long-forgotten sense of adventure.${prompt}
  9189: |-
    Once I've gotten all firedy-up, even you can'taru keep me back, Raogrimm.
    I'm sure my incomparable research skills will be of use in your task.${prompt}
  9190: |-
    C'mon, let's see a little excitement!
    This is our expedition's thirty-year rrreunion.${prompt}
  9191: |-
    It's not the Northlands this time.
    None of us are going to grow old and die, so who else would you want with you on a task as long as this one?${prompt}
  9192: |-
    I'm not gonna back down, no matterrr how much you complain.
    Better just give in and accept the fact that you're stuck with me.${prompt}
  9193: |-
    I thought this would be the end of you for sure...
    Hmph. You're just as thick-skinned as you used to be.${prompt}
  9194: |-
    What, no words for an old friend?
    Thinking about testing your theory on whether or not a soul can be killed?${prompt}
  9195: |-
    I betrayed you!
    I extinguished the light of your precious Cornelia!
    The man responsible for this entire nightmare stands right before you!${prompt}
  9196: |-
    Everything began thirty years ago.
    And there were things that came to an end...
    Even though I was a prisoner of uncontrollable rage, the fact remains that I took the lives of my companions with my own hands.${prompt}
  9197: And yet, my old companions, you are the ones who have saved me from falling into that pit of hatred a second time.${prompt}
  9198: |-
    I have words of gratitude, but do not stand in a position to blame anyone for their actions.
    No matter who that person may be.${prompt}
  9199: Raogrimm...${prompt}
  9200: |-
    Are you sure you want to do this?
    This duty will continue until hatred has faded from the land.
    As long as my divided soul remains, there may never be an end to that rage...${prompt}
  9201: |-
    Raogrimm.
    There is no need to suffer alone anymore.
    Our presence here should answer your question.${prompt}
  9202: |-
    There are crimes that must be atoned for.
    And if that means staying on after death and watching over this world, then we who were your companions will share the burden along with you.${prompt}
  9203: |-
    Until the dawn of an age without hatred...
    No, as long as this world continues to be, I will remain by your side.${prompt}

  9325: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  9326: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  9327: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  9328: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  9329: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  9330: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  9331: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  9332: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  9333: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  9334: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  9335: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  9336: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  9337: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  9338: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  9339: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  9340: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  9341: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  9342: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  9343: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  9344: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  9345: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  9346: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  9347: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'
  9348: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt}
  9349: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  9350: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  9351: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
  9352: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}

  9370: These items had been hidden-ethy in a chamber beneath the Tavnazian Sacrarium.${prompt}

  9379: And I was not called-ethy to Tavnazia to appraise the nature of that statue.${prompt}
  9380: My task was to discern-ethy where it had been excavated from by analyzing the traces of soil that still clung-ethy to its surface.${prompt}
  9381: And did you flang-fig-figurey out where the soil was from?${prompt}
  9382: |-
    Of course I did.

    Since you assisted-ethy me in my recent crisis, I suppose-ethy I can tell you what I know.
    I must-ethy warn you, though, that precious little was discovered.${prompt}
  9427: That expedition mostly served to prove-ethy the evil of the Northlands when two of the musketeers from the Bastokan contingent failed-ethy to return.${prompt}
  9428: The terrible power in that land has been whispered-ethy about for many years, but I do not believe-ethy that anyone has yet managed to discern where or what this power truly is.${prompt}
  9429: Minister Rukususu of the Rhinostery is continuing the investigation of the Northlands, but has discovered-ethy nothing more than a few trivial elements...${prompt}
  9430: All I know-ethy is that it was the suspicious actions of Bastok that interfered-ethy with the original expedition.${prompt}
  9431: But as for the details of what really happened-ethy back then, you should take-ethy your questions to Bastok or San d'Oria.${prompt}

    Hm? Hm? Hm?
    Now that you mention-ethy it, I seem to recall-ethy that Karaha-Baruha was only a child when he visited-ethy Tavnazia...${prompt}
  9435: I remember-ethy fighting with Minister Shantotto over who got to eat the tasty souvenirs he brought-ethy back... But that would mean-ethy...${prompt}

  9451: Abhorrent power...?${prompt}
  9452: You Tarutaru have had little experience with this type of magical energy.${prompt}

  9493: Under normal circumstances, it would be my duty as a Mithran Tracker to gain possession of that magicite by any means necessary, even if it meant carrrving it out of your hide...${prompt}

    Now that you mention it, there were also traces of Gustaberg soil mixed-ethy with the samples. I did not think-ethy anything of it at the time...${prompt}

    Trading cinder.${prompt}
  9787: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt}
  9788: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  9789: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt}
  9790: |-
    Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.
    If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt}
  9791: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  9792: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  9793: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  9794: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  9795: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  9796: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  9797: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  9798: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  9799: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  9800: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  9801: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  9802: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  9803: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  9804: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  9805: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  9806: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  9807: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  9808: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  9809: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  9810: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  9811: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  9812: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  9813: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  9814: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  9815: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  9816: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  9817: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  9818: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  9819: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  9820: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  9821: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  9822: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  9823: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  9824: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  9825: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  9826: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  9827: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  9828: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  9829: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  9830: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  9831: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  9832: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  9833: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  9834: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  9835: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  9836: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  9837: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  9838: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  9839: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  9840: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  9841: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  9842: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  9843: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  9844: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  9845: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  9846: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  9847: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  9848: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  9849: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  9850: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  9851: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  9852: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  9853: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  9854: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  9855: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  9856: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  9857: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  9858: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  9859: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  9860: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  9861: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  9862: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  9863: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  9864: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  9865: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  9866: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  9867: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  9868: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  9869: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  9870: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?
    Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt}

  9891: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  9892: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'
  9893: |-
    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  9894: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  9895: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  9896: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  9897: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  9898: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  9899: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}
  9900: |-
    That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.
    Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt}

    An aspiring synergist, I see!
    If you're looking for ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you've certainly come to the right place.${prompt}
  9902: |-
    I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for ${number: 0} gil.
    A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?${prompt}
  9903: '${number: 0} gil, paid in full!${prompt}'
  9904: |-
    As promised, here's your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you!
    How's that for a deal?${prompt}
  9905: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.${prompt}

  10064: Fine. I can still wrap this world in lethargy and ennui, and neither you, Diva, or Uka can stop me!
  10065: No! As long as there are light and smiles in this world, I will rise up to stop you!
  10066: That's our cue, everyone--Firesday Night Fever time!
  10067: Pardon me for breaking the fourth wall, but perhaps an explanation is in order.
  10068: Firesday Night Fever describes the special moments in a songstress's career when she is so intimately connected to her fan base that she can activate her “Dancing Force” without the need of any outward shows of support!
  10069: Hmph. You two are pathetic.
  10070: Goodbye, Ullegore, you've had a nice run!♪
  10071: But the Maidens are here, bringing Vana'diel fun!♪
  10072: The time has arrived to give the dark lord his due!♪
  10073: 'And so, evil spirits, I have this to say: pooh-pooh!♪'
  10074: Wh-what is the meaning of--!
  10075: Now's our chance, Mumor!
  10076: To see the inverted rainbow of your smile...
  10077: We'll dance to the abyss and back!
  10078: Mighty Maidens Mumor and Uka!
  10079: Eternal Vana Illusion!!!
  10080: Graaaaaaaaah!!!
  10081: We surrre gave him his comeuppance!
  10082: H-how could I...?
  10083: Wow, you're way worse at winning than I am!
  10084: You want me to leave your precious festival alone? Fine. I acquiesce.
  10085: Really? 'Cause if you break your promise, it'll be a thousand pricklies for you.
  10086: One thousand, ten thousand...bah, who can keep count?
  10087: C'mon, Mumor! Give him ten thousand right in the kisser!
  10088: Listen, guys! He hasn't broken his promise yet!
  10089: You are a curious one, Mumor. Most would relish in their victory and rub the loser's nose in it...but not you.
  10090: Though I have lost, I do not feel any ill will. Is this what “fun” is?
  10091: Okay, everyone! We've brought peace and happiness back to Vana'diel, so now it's time...I'm finally going to sing!
  10092: M-M-Mumor! D-d-don't!
  10093: Tra laaa laaaaaa...※★△✕▽!!!
  10094: Hm? Why isn't everyone cheering?
  10095: M-Mumor...I told you...not to...
  10096: This whole time...you were tone-deaf...
  10097: No...my number-one nemesis...all along was...some squawking sham!?
  10098: Oh come now, everyone! You're giving me a bad case of the uglies!
  10099: My darling festivalgoers, you brought a spring back to Uka's step and a tear to my eye! I love you...each and every one of you!
  10100: Why, without you, Ullegore would be running rampant across the land!
  10101: Next time I'll have a super-sweet melody prepared, so keep those ears open and wait with bated breath!
  10102: But for now...enjoy the festival!

  10113: M-Mumor! Don't worry! It's...nothing that practice couldn't fix, kupo.${prompt}

  10118: Well done, my dear. Well done.${prompt}
  10119: Daddy!${prompt}
  10120: Your spirit and emotions were dazzling, and your adoring fans were with you every step of the way. If anyone is worthy of being called an idol, it's you.${prompt}
  10121: Do you really think I'm worthy? But...my singing...${prompt}
  10122: Being an idol isn't only about singing and dancing.${prompt}
  10123: It's about winning the hearts of your fans and having them support you through thick and thin.${prompt}
  10124: I raised you to be an idol so that one day you might save the world. A father could be no prouder of his daughter.${prompt}
  10125: Oh, Daddy...${prompt}
  10126: My fine ${choice-player-gender}[lad/young woman], your support of Mumor throughout the years has meant the world to me.${prompt}
  10127: This I promise--as dedicated as her fans are to her, she is twice as dedicated to them.${prompt}
  10128: And it's thanks to you that I've shaken off the heebie-jeebies and am ready to face a new day!${prompt}
  10129: I have a special place in my heart for each and every one of my fans--but especially you!${prompt}

    I've been waiting for you, kupo!
    Mumor, the shining starlet herself, has slunk her way onto the streets to see you!${prompt}
  10131: I'm so glad you're here! With all my singing and battling, I never seem to find the time to meet my wonderful fans!
  10132: I was positively tickled to see you in the crowd. Can I ask your name?${prompt}
  10133: ${name-player}, your dancing was positively peachy!♪${prompt}
  10134: Remember how Diva called forth another me?${prompt}

    /歌はステージでしか
    But as friends, not as performer and fan. I've got to keep my voice pristine for next year!★${prompt}
  10147: A revival of Mumor's final performance will soon be underway.${prompt}
  10148: As always, your steadfast support can greatly affect the outcome of this magnificent show. Let me tell you how.${prompt}
  10149: Like any good diva, Mumor requires the cheers of her fans to unlock her true potential in the struggles that lie ahead. In short, your emotions are her strength.${prompt}
  10150: /clapping, /cheering, and /waving all have a positive affect on her, and switching between them has a greater effect than repeating the same one over and over.${prompt}
  10151: When Mumor has received enough accolades from her fans, she will unleash one of her powerful dance moves. When she does, dance along with her!${prompt}
  10152: Her dances include the following:${prompt}
  10153: |-
    Shining Summer Samba:
    /dance1
    Lovely Miracle Waltz:
    /dance2${prompt}
  10154: |-
    Neo Crystal Jig:
    /dance3
    Super Crusher Jig:
    /dance4${prompt}
  10155: That should cover it.${prompt}
  10156: Dancing the proper steps in sync with Mumor will strengthen the bond between the two of you.${prompt}
  10157: So unite as one to give Mumor the energy she so desperately needs!${prompt}
  10158: We will also be selling a variety of festival goods throughout the event. The more you buy, the happier Mumor becomes, so do your idol proud!${prompt}
  10159: That does it for the explanation of our event. I hope you enjoy the show!${prompt}
  10160: A super-special Starlight Celebration to you, ambitious adventurer!${prompt}
  10161: What am I saying!? This is hardly the time for gleeful greetings or alliterative addresses, kupo!${prompt}
  10162: |-
    Even as we speak, overzealous Goblins are partaking not just in the Starlight Celebration spirit, but others' precious presents!
    These Gobbies bear no bad blood, but their covetous capers are the cause of much consternation, kupo.${prompt}
  10163: |-
    And to make matters worse, they've even filched the furnishings the MHMU ordered from the guilds...
    I know the saying, “If you give a Goblin goulash...” but this is just rikupulous!${prompt}
  10164: |-
    Please, ${name-player}, I beseech you!
    Find the Goblins traipsing about town and teach them the meaning of private property once and for all!
    (By affably asking them to relinquish what they requisitioned, kupo.)${prompt}
  10165: |-
    It may seem like the MHMU is just exploiting the nearest adventurer, but nay! You--and only you--are capable of restoring resplendence and revelry to the realm.
    Now go forth and fulfill the festive fate we thrust upon you, kupo!${prompt}
  10166: |-
    Kupopopo!
    Have you forgotten your merry mission already? Get giddy, gift-grabbing Goblins around town to give back people's goods, then go gab to a Moogle when you're done.${prompt}
  10167: |-
    And remember, Gobbies like to stick their noses in other creatures' business, if you know what I mean.
    Snuff out your smell so they can't sense your spoils, kupo.${prompt}
  10168: |-
    And remember, Goblins go cuckoo for comestibles, kupo.
    Offer them their favorite food, for they should forget you even exist.${prompt}
  10169: |-
    And remember, Goblins just want to jump for joy and jubilation at this jocular time of year.
    Bequeath beastmen bills or bedazzling bijoux to them and you may find yourself furnished with furnishings in return, kupo.${prompt}
  10170: |-
    Great glorious Goddess, you've managed to procure a present! Praise be to your positively prodigious persistence!
    ...And your altruistic attitude after you return it to its rightful remitter, kupo!${prompt}
  10171: |-
    It looks like this gift is from someone named ${entity: 0}. Seek out the sender and start spreading some Starlight spirit, kupo!
    Oh, and watch out for mischievous Goblin mitts, my little gofer--I mean adventurer!${prompt}
  10172: |-
    Wonderful work, warden of weal!
    However, since giving is greater than receiving, how about giving ${entity: 0} word that you were able to deliver the present?${prompt}
  10173: |-
    The considerable amount of charity you've shown complete strangers cannot be overstated, kupo.
    Without your magnanimity, moxie, and master mediation skills, this year's Starlight Celebration would have been a much dimmer affair.${prompt}
  10174: |-
    Yet to polish this party to the point of pristine luster, more Goblins must be taught the difference between naughty and nice!
    Remember, once you give back a gift, seal the deal by simply sauntering over to the nearest moogle.
    We're counting on you, kupo!${prompt}
  10175: The MHMU humbly offers you this token of our thanks, not only for making the world a brighter place, but for tolerating our moogle mummery and the voluminous vats of verbosity that violated your virgin ears.${prompt}
  10176: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! I forgot those festive Gobbies are still frolicking with our furnishings, kupo!${prompt}
  10177: |-
    I'm so sorry to solicit further favors from you, but could you kindly retrieve those as well?
    Pretty please with paprika on top? You wouldn't want to keep us from rewarding the good boys and girls of Vana'diel, would you, kupo?${prompt}
  10178: |-
    Kupo ho ho! Do my deteriorating eyes deceive me, or is that one of the furnishings we ordered?
    We'd planned on giving them all to needy orphans, but you've done so much for the MHMU recently, why don't you have this one? 'Tis the season, so they say.${prompt}
  10179: |-
    What an astounding accomplishment, as expected of an adventurer like you!
    We are eternally grateful for the copious kindnesses you've conferred upon us, kupo.${prompt}
  10180: |-
    Word around the union fountain is that other nations' furnishings still remain at large. Would it be too terrible a torment to traipse around town--peepers peeled for gregarious Gobbies ogling purported presents--the next time you visit another nation?
    The MHMU would be forever in your debt, kupo.${prompt}
  10181: (Wheeew, way to whisk that one under the rug. I could never tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] that we got distracted by the dazzling decorations and had the furnishings nabbed from nigh under our noses!)${prompt}
  10182: Happy toy, happy toy, where be me happy toy?♪
  10183: |-
    Ev'ry girl, ev'ry boy, ev'rybody, happy toy!

    The joy from happy toy!

    This for me? In-doo-bid-ably!
    Could be gooder, but it not bad.
  10185: |-
    Waaah! It you!
    You give yum-yums for me tum-tum. Good ${choice-player-gender}[guy/girl]!
  10186: |-
    Not for us, not for me?
    I give it back. Now you happy?
    Happy toy, happy toy, where be me happy toy?♪
  10187: |-
    No no no no no!
    Go away! Nose holes busy sniff for happy toy!
  10188: '...'
  10189: You have friend, you do? We Gobbies have friend too.
  10190: Yum-yums for me? Gobbies remember...till our tummies go rumble-rumble again.
  10191: |-
    For me!? Why give so nice thing to me!?
    Me so happy head go boom! So boom!
    But first, me need give happy toy to you too.
  10192: |-
    Happy toy? For me?
    Why you give so good thing to me?
    But no can take. Me have no happy toy for you.
  10193: |-
    Blech. What this yucky thing?
    It make me want upgut food. Take it away.
  10194: |-
    What? But how...?
    If that's truly from ${entity: 0}, that must mean...you stole it and you're ransoming it back to me!
    If you think for one moment that I'd pay scum like you, you'd best think twice!${prompt}
  10195: |-
    Oh, I see. My apologies.
    How silly of me. Everyone knows how mischievous Goblins get during the Starlight Celebration season. I read somewhere that it's got something to do with the moon and the tides or whatnot.${prompt}
  10196: |-
    Anyway, sorry to trouble you, but could you deliver this in my stead?
    I may look like a strapping young lad, but I have this illness that prevents me from doing the same task twice in one day. Quite troublesome, really.${prompt}
  10197: |-
    Also, could you do me a favor and report back to me after you're done?
    I didn't want to spend the extra gil for delivery confirmation with times as tough as they are, you know?${prompt}
  10198: |-
    I take it you delivered my present safe and sound?
    Oh, and it was well received, too? Ha, you didn't need to tell me that, for my gifts are always a hit.
    I guess I should thank you though, seeing as how you played a tiny part in my Starlight Celebration success.${prompt}
  10199: |-
    Waaah, a cutthroat! Take anything you want, just not my lucky chocobo hose, please! I...
    Wait, isn't that the gift I sent ${entity: 0}? You didn't steal that too, did you!?${prompt}
  10200: |-
    What!? You...valiantly wrested it from the clutches of a greedy Goblin so you could return it to me?
    I just knew my ${choice-player-gender}[handsome champion/fair handmaiden] in resplendent regalia would come some day!${prompt}
  10201: |-
    I'm sure you've been through quite a few trials and tribulations just getting this back to me, your fair lady. However, my hands are tied at the moment and I can't take this present to ${entity: 0}.
    Therefore, I command you, my loyal follower, to act as my liaison and deliver it unscathed. I have no doubt that you'll succeed, since a ${choice-player-gender}[knight/handmaiden] will do anything to serve and protect ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] mistress.${prompt}
  10202: And please don't forget to check in with me after the delivery is made. Every ${choice-player-gender}[champion/handmaiden] knows that's the ${choice-player-gender}[chivalrous/proper] thing to do.${prompt}
  10203: |-
    How fared your journey, my ${choice-player-gender}[courageous champion/humble handmaiden]?
    Oh, I simply knew I could place my complete trust in you! You've not only made your fair lady quite proud, but saved the Starlight Celebration from those covetous beastmen! Oh, joyous day!${prompt}
  10204: 'I beg your pardon, but I cannot help but notice that this is the parcel I sent to ${entity: 0}. How might you have come by it?${prompt}'
  10205: |-
    Ah, I see. Those Goblin rapscallions still show a complete and utter disregard for social graces, would you not agree?
    At any rate, you seem to possess a rather strong sense of justice, and for that I am most grateful.${prompt}
  10206: 'Could you also find it within your heart to see that this package reaches ${entity: 0} safely? I may be a man of humble means, but you will certainly have my eternal gratitude and undying admiration.${prompt}'
  10207: |-
    Oh my. This utterly slipped my addled mind.
    I am truly sorry, but I fear I must heap one more request upon your already burdened back. Could you please report back to me after you've made the delivery?
    It would undoubtedly lessen the anxiety weighing down my fragile heart.${prompt}
  10208: |-
    Goddess be good, you have returned! And with favorable tidings, no?
    Splendid. Absolutely splendid. Thanks to you, I feel as if I could burst into a Starlight carol at any moment. Fa-la-la-la～♪.${prompt}
  10209: |-
    What doth bring thee 'fore these rheumy eyes, orbs that pierce the soul and a stranger's guise?
    Harken, thou hast ${entity: 0}'s present, from whom hast thou received such consent?${prompt}
  10210: |-
    'Tis an entertaining tale with which thy jowls doth flail,
    A tale of Goblins run amok, and wretched me bereft of luck.
    Still, thanks are in store for completing this chore with a dearth of gore.${prompt}
  10211: |-
    While these next words may conjure a storm, I cannot assist thee in any form.
    Thus, I entreat thee to heed the call...deliver this gift to ${entity: 0} once and for all!${prompt}
  10212: |-
    'Fore I finish this lengthy tirade, one last request must be made.
    Once the gift hath changed hands, return at once for further plans.${prompt}
  10213: |-
    Thou hast safely returned from thy trial? Upon us both doth Altana smile!
    To thee, the savior of the Starlight Celebration, I do give heartfelt acclamations!${prompt}
  10214: |-
    Wh-wh-what have you got there? It looks awfully-wafully like the gift I gave to ${entity: 0}.
    Did something happen? P-p-please don't tell me that ${entity: 0} passy-wassed away!${prompt}
  10215: |-
    ...It was just a G-g-goblin prank?
    Sorry to overreactaru. I had a t-t-traumatic experience last Starlight Devastation--er, Celebration! So now I always feary-wear the worst.
    By the way, th-th-thank you for getting my gift back.${prompt}
  10216: 'As you can guess, m-m-my comfort zone is rather itty-bitty. I know you must be expired--tired! But can you please helpy-welp me and deliver my present to ${entity: 0}?${prompt}'

    Ah, you're back!
    It's ${entity: 0}'s most perished, er, cherished possession, you say? Wh-wh-what lofty-wofty praise!
    I can't thank you enough for your c-c-contributions, adventurer.${prompt}
  10219: |-
    So many nasty-wasty things happened to me today, I'm just too moody-woody to listen to your blather!
    Begone before I--wait, isn't that my present to ${entity: 0}?${prompt}
  10220: Ugh, quit barking like a bog dog, ${choice-player-gender}[brother-wother/sister-wister]! I don't give a ham and cheese about giddy Goblins or lazy moogles.${prompt}
  10221: |-
    You think you're so great because you saved my present from some baddie-waddies? Bah humbug-wumbug!
    If you're gonna stick your nosey-wose in others' business, then you bettaru finish what you started!
    You'll be taking that gift on over to ${entity: 0}, I tell you what!${prompt}
  10222: |-
    And don't think for a minute-winute that I'm going to let you get away with ruining my day! Report back here for a tongue-lashing when you're done!
    Now get going before I gutaru you right here and now!${prompt}
  10223: |-
    Hmph, so you're stupid as well as rude? Are you so subservient that you'd actually come backy-wack for a beating?
    Get out of my face! You disgustaru me. Oh, and Merry Starlight!${prompt}
  10224: 'Hey, I sent that to ${entity: 0}. Why do you have it?${prompt}'
  10225: |-
    Hmmm. Stolen by Gobbies, huh?
    Thanks for getting it back.${prompt}
  10226: 'Sorry to burden you, but could you bring it to ${entity: 0} again for me?${prompt}'
  10227: Also, I'd like it if you could please fill me in when you're done.${prompt}
  10228: |-
    I see you've returned.
    Mmm...that's good news indeed. Thank you for the kindness you've shown me and my friend.${prompt}
  10229: |-
    What have we here? A cat burrrglar?
    How dare you despoil the innocent people of our fair nation!${prompt}
  10230: |-
    What am I talking about?
    That's the prrresent I sent ${entity: 0}! How could you have it if you didn't steal it!?${prompt}
  10231: |-
    Oh, I see. You're a defender of justice too.
    Good job negotiating with those Goblin scum. I just hope that rrrepeating that story to everyone you've saved hasn't got you hacking up hairballs.${prompt}
  10232: 'But enough tail wagging. I have some prey I need to take care of, so could you rrredeliver that gift to ${entity: 0} and report back to me when you''re done?${prompt}'
  10233: |-
    What timing! I've just rrreturned from my own mission.
    Whew, good thing ${entity: 0} liked it! That little trinket was as high priced as the hair on a cat's back!
    Anyway, thanks for your help. If your fur ever gets rubbed the wrong way, give me a sign and I'll come rrroaring to the rescue!${prompt}
  10234: |-
    A present...from ${entity: 0}? Oh, glorious day!
    This is for all those times I never got a present and kept telling myself next year will be the one.${prompt}

    I'm at a loss for what to say! I'm just overwhelmed with a waterfall of emotion!
    Thank you so much!${prompt}
  10236: |-
    And please thank ${entity: 0} the next time you see that good samaritan.
    The person who said, “'Tis better to give than receive” probably never had a gift drought as long as mine. I feel fantastic!${prompt}
  10237: 'Oh, is that...a present? From ${entity: 0}, you say?${prompt}'
  10238: |-
    Ugh, it figures. Did it come with a card that says something pathetic like “I've died a thousand deaths drowning in the depths of your eyes”?

    Oooh, a gift from ${entity: 0}?
    What jolly-wolly tidings you've brought, adventurer.${prompt}
  10250: |-

  10251: |-
    No, thataru wouldn't be right. Besides, it might not be edible.

    The Starlight Celebration, you say? So that explains the light shows and festive atmosphere around here lately.
    My head just hasn't been the same since I fell off that chocobo last month.${prompt}
  10254: |-
    I best start looking for something to give in return. In the meantime, please tell ${entity: 0} how happy I am to have received this.
    And maybe next year I'll remember before it's too late. <Sigh>...One can only hope.${prompt}
  10255: "A present for me? \nI'm a lone lioness, and I don't need to share my kills with anyone!${prompt}"

    That's where I come in, kupo.

  10265: 'To make use of my services, first you''ll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of ${number: 19} gil.${prompt}'
  10266: Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt}
  10267: You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt}
  10268: Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt}

    Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.
    I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt}
  10270: |-
    Invisible to you, at least.
    It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt}
  10271: When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt}
  10272: |-
    I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.
    Simple as that, kupo!${prompt}
  10273: |-
    What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!
    Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt}
  10274: |-
    Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.
    So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt}
  10275: For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt}
  10276: |-
    Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!
    It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt}
  10277: Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt}
  10278: |-
    If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!
    No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”
    Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt}
  10279: Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt}
  10280: If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt}
  10281: |-
    And that's all there is to it.

  10569: Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).${prompt}
  10570: Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.${prompt}
  10571: “Wanted” objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.${prompt}
  10572: These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as “Unity accolades” to undertake.${prompt}
  10573: Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.${prompt}
  10574: Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.${prompt}
  10575: The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.${prompt}

  10577: Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.${prompt}
  10578: Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.${prompt}
  10579: When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.${prompt}
  10580: Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  10581: No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.${prompt}

  10586: Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  10587: These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.${prompt}
  10588: Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.${prompt}
  10589: You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.${prompt}
  10590: This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.${prompt}
  10591: This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.${prompt}
  10592: However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.${prompt}
  10593: Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.${prompt}
  10594: The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.${prompt}
  10595: Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.${prompt}
  10596: Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.${prompt}
  10597: On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.${prompt}
  10598: 'Additionally, an individual''s evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by ${number: 0}. A Unity''s ranking is the average of all eligible members'' individual evaluations.${prompt}'
  10599: The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.${prompt}
  10600: Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.${prompt}
  10601: 'Those with evaluations of ${number: 0} or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.${prompt}'
  10602: Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.${prompt}
  10603: A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.${prompt}
  10604: Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.${prompt}
  10605: A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.${prompt}
  10606: It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.${prompt}

  10721: He claims that not even the crystal is enough to illuminate it.${prompt}

  10723: What a morbid state of affairs we find ourselves in.${prompt}

    Dear Yoran-Oran, of course I know of this world.

    Vana'diel is in but one of countless dimensions.

  10747: |-
    Up until now I couldn't prove its existence,
    But help them I shall, if they need my assistance.${prompt}
  10748: |-
    The name by itself is a cause for alarm,
    And doubtless there are monsters who wish to cause harm.${prompt}
  10749: Diddly-doo, the universe is such a big place!${prompt}
  10750: |-
    Koru-Moru, you act as if you're wholly disconnected,
    But how soon you forget that monstrosity you've erected.${prompt}
  10751: |-
    You're always involved in some monkey business,
    And to a more sorry sight I've never borne witness.${prompt}
  10752: What did you do this time?${prompt}
  10753: I made a won-diddly-onderful contraption...or so I had thought. Turned into one of my biggest mistakes in recent memory.${prompt}
  10754: The world is full of all mannerareeno of terrible creatures, and I weep for a land that never knows peace.${prompt}
  10755: You know what I mean--you're an adventureeno!${prompt}
  10756: But the forces of light and dark must always be in balance, and one never wins out for very long.${prompt}
  10757: So if some diddly-darkness appears somewhere...${prompt}
  10758: Then there must be some way to seekareeno it out.${prompt}
  10759: And you want to use that thing-ethy of yours to find the evil they're on the lookout for?${prompt}
  10760: Just think-diddly-ink about it! What hero wouldn't want to get their hands on something that could seek out evil before it strikes?${prompt}
  10761: '...Though I had intended to use it to root out cheating studentareenos...${prompt}'
  10762: But it did the strange-diddly-angest thing when I brought it to life. It pointed in a really weird direction.${prompt}
  10763: |-
    And so when he brought it to me with a look of concern,
    I found what you call Tartarus, and much did I learn.${prompt}
  10764: |-
    Thus I present to you without further ado,
    His deranged contraption, with purpose anew.${prompt}
  10765: |-
    The very thought of this is enough to give pause,
    But I think it can help you, with all of its flaws.${prompt}
  10766: I agree-ethy. If it points to large upswells of magic-ethy, that might help you find where the energy of the crystals is being drained to.${prompt}
  10767: And if the crystals were to fade-ethy...well, I hardly need spell out what that means.${prompt}

    Though since Koru-Moru made it, I'd be remiss to assume
    That it will work without failure and not spell your doom.${prompt}
