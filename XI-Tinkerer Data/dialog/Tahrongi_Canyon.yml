  10881: |-
    What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo!
    Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!${prompt}
  10882: |-
    We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers.
    But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!${prompt}
  10883: |-
    There! I've whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me.
    Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!${prompt}
  10884: |-
    Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo.
    Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom.
    It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!${prompt}
  10885: The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!${prompt}
  10886: |-
    In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign.
    Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.${prompt}
  10887: Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...${prompt}
  10888: |-
    King Kupofried was greatly dismayed.
    How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?${prompt}
  10889: In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.${prompt}
  10890: “Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo,” he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.${prompt}
  10891: |-
    Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin.
    A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?${prompt}
  10892: |-
    We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition.
    We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!${prompt}

    Hi there! I'm ${related-entity}, your friendly neighborhood smile sergeant!
    I'm in charge of running the ${choice: 0}[beginner/intermediate/advanced] level Smilebringer Boot Camp in this area.${prompt}
  10943: |-
    I'd be thrilled to answer any questions you might have...and of course, sign you up, too!
    You'd like that, wouldn't you? Hmmm?${prompt}
  10944: |-
    What will you do?
    ${selection-lines}
    Undertake training.
    Hear an explanation.
    What's the qualifying time?
    What's the fastest time?
    Nothing.${prompt}
  10945: 'Fantastic! But, oh...it seems you don''t have ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}. Well, that''s just too bad!'
  10946: |-
    It'd be my pleasure! Here goes nothing! Ahem!
    The Smilebringer Boot Camp was established for two purposes, the first being the ongoing training and conditioning of smilebringers. The second--and this is where you come in, yay!--is for us to scout hopefuls from the adventurer community to join our jovial ranks!${prompt}
  10947: The population of vicious monsters has grown in recent years, you see. And because of this, more smilebringers were being--<gasp!>--injured in the line of duty than ever before.${prompt}
  10948: |-
    But we weren't going to take that sitting down, no siree.
    The day we smilebringers stop doing our job--that is, bringing smiles--is the day the world ends!${prompt}
  10949: Whatever the predicament, and no matter the size of the ruszor-inflicted gash wound, we will--we must--pull through...for the sake of the children!${prompt}
  10950: |-
    With these heart-warming ideals in mind, the Smilebringer Boot Camp was established. Ta-da!
    Smilebringers graduating from this camp are better equipped to meet the ever-changing needs of these unstable times we live in.${prompt}
  10951: |-
    The rules are as simple as sunshine. Smilebringer's honor!
    When I give you the word, run to each of the checkpoints we've set up in the area. “Smile helpers” are posted at each, so you can't miss them!${prompt}
  10952: |-
    Talk to the smile helpers and they'll confirm your passage.
    The route you take is completely up to you--just be sure you don't miss any checkpoints. You got all that? Hmmm?${prompt}
  10953: I'll mark each smile helper's location on your map beforehand, so you don't need to worry about getting lost.${prompt}
  10954: Once you've finished visiting all the checkpoints, you have to--you guessed it!--come back and report to me. It's okay, I won't bite!${prompt}
  10955: What I will do, though, is tell you how quickly you completed the course. After all, to a smilebringer, speed is everything. Some folks run faster with a fell beast hot on their tail, but we smilebringers need no more than the thought of a child's laughter to spur us on! Zoom zoom!${prompt}
  10956: Oh, and I should mention that at this time of year, we're collecting donations in the form of a small fee to participate in the training. All proceeds go towards presents for the children during the Starlight Celebration. Thank you for your cooperation!${prompt}
  10957: |-
    One more thing you should know. If you venture out of the area, the training will automatically be canceled.
    But I can trust you not to walk out on your favorite smile sergeant, right? Hmmm?
  10958: |-
    So far, the fastest time in this area is ${number: 5} minute${choice-plurality: 5}[/s] ${number: 6} second${choice-plurality: 6}[/s]. Wow!
    And the name of the greased lightning who set this record is ${entity: 0}. Don't be forgetting that, you hear?${prompt}
  10959: |-
    We'd like all participants to complete this area's course within ${number: 1} minute${choice-plurality: 1}[/s] ${number: 2} second${choice-plurality: 2}[/s]. A piece of cake for a strapping young ${choice-player-gender}[wolf/vixen] like you, surely!
    And if you manage a time quicker than ${number: 3} minute${choice-plurality: 3}[/s] ${number: 4} second${choice-plurality: 4}[/s]...then you and I had better trade places! Oh, that would be so much fun, wouldn't it?${prompt}
  10960: |-
    Awww... You've made this smile sergeant very sad...
    But I'll be glued to this spot, because I just know you'll be back to turn my frown upside down! Yes siree!
  10961: |-
    At this time of year, we're collecting a donation of ${number: 6} gil from each participant.
    All proceeds go towards presents for the children. Oh, won't you think of the children? <Sniffle>...${prompt}
  10962: |-
    Give to the children?
    ${selection-lines}
    I live to give!
    Charity begins at home.${prompt}
  10963: |-
    But of course! First, I'll need you to lend me your ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}...
    Oh, don't pout! I'll give it back as soon as I'm done, promise!${prompt}
  10964: |-
    You'll find each of the ten smile helpers by the points I've indicated.
    Don't forget to talk with every one of them or it won't count, okay?${prompt}
  10965: |-
    There! I've marked each smile helper's location for you.
    If you ever lose your bearings in the middle of a run, just open up your map and everything will be aaall right. Trust me! <Wink>${prompt}
  10966: |-
    So, are you ready-steady?
    ${choice: 0}[Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced] level training...GO!
    Come on, pump those legs like there's no tomorrow!
  10967: Since the Starlight Celebration has ended, we've had to make a few changes.${prompt}
  10968: But the Smilebringer Boot Camp will be available for off-season conditioning the whole year round, so come back whenever you're in the mood. I'll be waiting for you!
  10969: |-
    Oh, you're back! I was afraid we'd lost you to some foul creature prowling the wilderness.
    Let's start from the top, shall we?
  10970: |-

    Periapt.${prompt}
  11102: The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called “Voidwalkers.” Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt}
  11103: |-
    Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.
    This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt}
  11104: Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt}
  11105: A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt}
  11106: Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt}
  11107: |-
    Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.
    Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt}
  11108: Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt}
  11109: Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt}
  11110: However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt}
  11111: |-
    When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.
    These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt}
  11112: Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt}
  11113: The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt}
  11114: |-
    Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.
    Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt}
  11115: As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt}
  11116: Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt}
  11117: Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt}
  11118: After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt}
  11119: Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt}
  11120: Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  11121: While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  11122: Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt}

  11124: Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt}
  11125: Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt}
  11126: Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt}

    Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts.
    By infusing atmacite to one's body using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.${prompt}
  11132: Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}

  11139: Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt}
  11140: Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.${prompt}

  12005: Do you think? I'm not so sure...${prompt}
  12006: That's it! It's so clear to me now!${prompt}
  12007: I wish I could go with you, but know that I'm there in spirit.${prompt}
  12008: It doesn't take a soothsayer to know that darkness bodes ill. Stay safe.${prompt}
  12009: I'll be there, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12010: Master! Look--Lady Lion!${prompt}
  12011: Master!${prompt}
  12012: Lion? Lion!?
  12013: I...saw it again...
  12014: ${name-player}, that special orb you have is a relic from the future.${prompt}
  12015: Maybe that explains the visions I've been having.${prompt}
  12016: If what it portends is true, then there is nothing we can do to stop the darkness from approaching.${prompt}
  12017: But ${name-player}, I saw nothing about whether or not you were there to try to stop it.${prompt}
  12018: What if there is no one to stand up for Vana'diel? Will it perish with but a whimper?${prompt}
  12019: Lion, perhaps it is because the orb is not yet fully illuminated.${prompt}
  12020: I agree. Yet we learned about the coming darkness before the light could fully arrive...likely ushering it in before we were ready.${prompt}
  12021: 'I know not what the two of you are on about, so I will ask one simple question: what can we do?${prompt}'
  12022: ${name-player}, another image that floated before my eyes was one of you vanquishing the Shadow Lord.${prompt}
  12023: The Shadow Lord!?
  12024: And the crystal spoke to you when you did.${prompt}
  12025: Then it all falls into place.${prompt}
  12026: You must stand steadfast against the lord of the beastmen in order to set history upon its proper course.${prompt}
  12027: In the future from which I hail, the master faced many threats--not just this one--and came to be known as one of Vana'diel's most storied heroes.${prompt}
  12028: Master, you must take your first steps along that path.${prompt}
  12029: '...Stop the Shadow Lord.${prompt}'
  12030: ${name-player}, there are many paths that lie before you.${prompt}
  12031: They opened up the moment you banished the Shadow Lord from our realm.${prompt}
  12032: My dream showed me many nations, many worlds...and you were there in each one, bringing succor to those who cried out.${prompt}
  12033: Then it all falls into place.${prompt}
  12034: In the future from which I hail, the master faced many threats--not just that one--and came to be known as one of Vana'diel's most storied heroes.${prompt}
  12035: Master, you must bring history back to its natural state.${prompt}
  12036: '...And time is not exactly on our side...${prompt}'
  12037: ${name-player}, your journeys have taken you to the far corners of our realm.${prompt}
  12038: The reckoning is at hand, quicker than any of us could have prepared for.${prompt}
  12039: Then it all falls into place.${prompt}
  12040: In the future from which I hail, the master faced many threats and came to be known as one of Vana'diel's most storied heroes.${prompt}
  12041: And ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] legend has already been forged.${prompt}
  12042: Then we may be out of time...${prompt}
  12043: And now you know everything that I do.${prompt}
  12044: I'll be with you every step of your journey to conquer the Shadow Lord.${prompt}
  12045: I'll do everything in my power to help you.${prompt}
  12046: What the...${prompt}
  12047: Lady Lion, allow me to express my gratitude.${prompt}
  12048: Your honesty and strength of spirit has taken physical form.${prompt}
  12049: And...you can use it?${prompt}
  12050: Then you're quite welcome.${prompt}
  12051: In the meantime, I'll continue my search for information about the Shadow Lord.${prompt}
  12052: In the meantime, I'll continue my search for information about Escha.${prompt}
  12053: Zeid, what do you plan on doing?${prompt}
  12054: Gilgamesh has asked me to report back as soon as I know something, so my first order of business is to return to Norg.${prompt}
  12055: Lion and Zeid, your assistance has been invaluable.${prompt}
  12056: Master, I intend to learn all I can about that bell.${prompt}
  12057: I await good news about the Shadow Lord's defeat.${prompt}
  12058: Perhaps you should head back to Norg as well.${prompt}
  12059: Until then.

  12061: The celestial capital of Al'Taieu welcomes you.${prompt}
  12062: Would that it would do so with open arms, but the vortex slowly eats away at my home.${prompt}
  12063: The capital is not the only thing to succumb. I, too, feel my energy beginning to fade.${prompt}
  12064: You are eminently aware that I am not supposed to be present in this haven.${prompt}
  12065: The void is compressing time, and things that once remained separate are starting to collide.${prompt}
  12066: Perhaps it might be easiest to think of me as a wandering spirit.${prompt}
  12067: No, you needn't offer me any explanation.${prompt}
  12068: I have already heard that Siren's benevolence has guided you here.${prompt}
  12069: You and Iroha have sought guidance from companions all throughout Vana'diel in order to stop the encroaching darkness.${prompt}
  12070: In Iroha's future was an event called “the Reckoning” in which you made a decision that rang throughout the land.${prompt}
  12071: As a result, Iroha was left alone, confined to Reisenjima.${prompt}
  12072: A future in which Iroha was the only child of Altana left in Vana'diel.${prompt}
  12073: And so you wish to beseech Altana herself for guidance...for any hint on how this bleak future can be altered.${prompt}
  12074: Al'Taieu is oft referred to as the celestial capital because it has a stronger connection with Altana than anywhere on the ground below.${prompt}
  12075: And I am able to commune with the terrestrial avatars and pass through the veil separating this world from the next via the crystal. Yet even I do not possess the means to reach Altana herself.${prompt}
  12076: Even the most powerful forces in the lands, forces that can create whole worlds, cannot approach her.${prompt}
  12077: Not even Odin.${prompt}
  12078: No, such a feat requires more than anyone could hope to muster.${prompt}
  12079: A power so great it could make the five crystals whole once more.${prompt}
  12080: Yet did the future Siren not mention that a key may yet lie in Reisenjima?${prompt}
  12081: I find no cause to doubt her, particularly in light of what I have discovered.${prompt}
  12082: What if we could create a crystal that could banish the Emptiness?${prompt}
  12083: ${name-player}, you have traversed the cavernous maws, so I need not remind you that you have visited worlds other than our own.${prompt}
  12084: These worlds exist in parallel, and each has its own past, present, and future.${prompt}
  12085: Tartarus, a place known by a select few in Eastern Ulbuka, is one such world.${prompt}
  12086: Countless years have I spent ensuring balance between these worlds, that they never interfere with each other.${prompt}
  12087: From each I have drawn but a small fraction of crystal energy...${prompt}

    Accumulating light.${prompt}
  12090: It is precisely as I have said. I have undertaken this plan since long before Iroha arrived here in this era.${prompt}
  12091: This plan is to create a new crystal in Reisenjima, the holy land of the Far East, and create a safe haven from the darkness. A plan, I add, that requires an inordinate amount of time to bring to fruition.${prompt}
  12092: Iroha's presence or absence makes no difference.${prompt}
  12093: The result would be the same.${prompt}
  12094: ${name-player}, if what I said overlaps with anything Siren told you, then you may have just found another piece of the puzzle.${prompt}
  12095: But what this “Reckoning” that Iroha speaks of is, I know not.${prompt}
  12096: '...${prompt}'
  12097: You are the Warrior of the Crystal...and are destined to become the Warrior of Light.${prompt}
  12098: You will coalesce thousands of points of light into a single shining star, your radiance casting out the darkness.${prompt}
  12099: And you will become more than a mere Warrior.${prompt}
  12100: Master, all the grand adventures you have embarked on led you here.${prompt}
  12101: You have guided us all to the final struggle against an unthinkable future.${prompt}
  12102: Vanquish the darkness that lies within you!${prompt}

  12104: 'Even in the most trying of times, there is one virtue that humanity does not abandon: hope.${prompt}'
  12105: It is your calling to keep that hope alive.${prompt}
  12106: Iroha is the only one who can aid you in making your final decision.${prompt}
  12107: And there is one more thing.${prompt}
  12108: I would have you aid me should you feel that my plan is the proper course of action.${prompt}
  12109: All I have worked to collect these many years is slowly being absorbed into the world known as Tartarus.${prompt}
