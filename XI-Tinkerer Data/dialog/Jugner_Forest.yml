  7577: Ballista is an exercise once used by the San d'Orian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word “ballista” means “to throw a stone,” and the game has been a part of Vana'dielian military history for centuries.${prompt}
  7578: |-
    The rules are simple.
    Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vana'diel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.${prompt}
  7579: 'Players from both teams must search for ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} that a ${color: 5}Herald${color: 1} has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  7580: 'These ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} into them.${prompt}'
  7581: Finally, a player's strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.${prompt}
  7582: '${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the ${color: 5}Quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.${prompt}'
  7583: 'Sometimes a player may find items other than ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}, such as potions. These ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).${prompt}'
  7584: |-
    Players can carry more than one ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, but they cannot throw the stones away once they have obtained them.
    However, players will lose their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} if they:
    (1) Successfully throw them into a rook.
    (2) Leave the area.
    (3) Are knocked out.${prompt}
  7585: 'But don''t forget, a player will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command while in possession of a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. And, players can only use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command if they carry one of the stones.${prompt}'
  7586: As one can see, careful planning and impeccable timing are the keys to victory.${prompt}
  7587: 'All participants of Ballista will have the ability to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. This will temporarily increase one''s movement speed, creating a better chance to find and obtain ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  7588: 'However, remember that once a player has obtained a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, he or she will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. In its place, though, one may use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command.${prompt}'
  7589: 'The locations of the ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} are constantly changing. This makes it quite difficult to find the targets by just randomly walking about the area.${prompt}'
  7590: 'Communication with one''s team members is, of course, one way to locate ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}. However, another way is by using the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command. This will inform a player of the approximate location of the nearest ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  7591: 'Finally, ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} can only be used when a player is carrying a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. Because ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used at this time, players must be weary of approaching enemies.${prompt}'
  7592: 'So, a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} has been obtained and a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1} located. Now all that''s left is tossing the stone in, right? Wrong.${prompt}'
  7593: There is one aspect of Ballista that has yet to be mentioned...and this is where the real battle begins.${prompt}
  7594: 'To throw a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} into a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}, a player must first wait until the ${color: 5}Rook''s${color: 1} gate is open. This takes impeccable timing, as the gate is only open for a short while.${prompt}'
  7595: |-
    But not just anyone can score points this way. A player must first take down a member of the opposing team and achieve ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status.
    Only then will his or her shots count.${prompt}
  7596: This extreme method of combat is what made the ancient game of Ballista famous, and transformed its participants into heroes.${prompt}
  7597: Running about looking for stones is no different from a child's game of hide-and-seek. Knowing when to strike is what separates the men from the boys.${prompt}
  7598: |-
    The following match types are area-specific:
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Allowed: Jugner Forest
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Restricted: Pashhow Marshlands
    Best of Three (three matches) * Normal Items Allowed: Meriphataud Mountains${prompt}
  7599: |-
    ${color: 5}Best of Three${color: 1} series rules are as follows:
    Winning a match will earn a nation one “match point.” The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for “come-from-behind” victories.${prompt}
  7600: Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nation's forces.${prompt}
  7601: Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.${prompt}
  7602: When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.${prompt}
  7603: For more information on temporary items, refer to the “special rules.”${prompt}
  7604: After being KO'd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.${prompt}
  7605: If a player chooses to return to their force's camp, HP and MP will be fully restored, but all TP will be lost.${prompt}
  7606: |-

    Also, several new special rules have been added.${prompt}

  7608: 'Previously, participants in Ballista were required to use an item the moment they dug it up using the /quarry command. However, players can now stock these items as ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} for use at any time during the match.${prompt}'
  7609: 'Players can hold up to ten ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1}, but only one of each type. If a player finds an item that they already possess, they must use it immediately or throw it away.${prompt}'
  7610: 'If players who possess ten ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} find an item that they have not already obtained, they will also have the option to exchange it with one of their current items.${prompt}'
  7611: Also, players will not, at any time, be allowed to trade temporary items. However, there are items that can be used on other Ballista participants. Please note that players may not be able to use these special items as soon as they are quarried.${prompt}
  7612: 'Finally, the Heralds will collect ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} when the match (the third in a Best of Three series) has concluded.${prompt}'
  7613: 'Ballista Points are rewarded to each competitor based on his or her performance in a single Ballista match. The maximum number of points that can be accumulated per match is ${number: 0}.${prompt}'
  7614: 'While it is taken into consideration, scoring ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} is not the only way to earn Ballista Points. Assisting allies and defeating members of the enemy forces can also earn a high score.${prompt}'
  7615: 'Ballista Points can be traded for special “vouchers,” which may be exchanged for free ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} at the start of new matches.${prompt}'

    However, remember that depending on the level restriction of the match, certain vouchers will not be redeemed at the beginning of a match.
    Speak with a ${color: 5}Marshal${color: 1} directly after a match to register your points.${prompt}
  7617: 'Players will only be allowed to score up to five ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} at a time. Also, a player''s ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status will be automatically disengaged if a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} is not scored within a certain amount of time. The amount of time is increased for those members of the team currently behind in points.${prompt}'
  7618: 'All allies within a certain radius will achieve ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status when a member of the enemy forces is defeated.${prompt}'
  7619: Players' resistance to sleep will be increased.${prompt}
  7620: 'During the entry period, from ${number: 0}:${number-alt: 1}, all adventurers will be allowed to join the forces with the smallest number of participants, regardless of allegiance. Open entries will be accepted until both sides have reached maximum capacity.${prompt}'

    In order to ensure balanced matches, the following level limits are enforced:

    Conquest points.
    The effects of controlling regions.
    Regions controlled by other nations.
    Regions under beastman control.${prompt}
  8055: All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt}
  8056: Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt}
  8057: Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt}
  8058: So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt}
  8059: |-
    Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.
    They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt}
  8060: Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt}
  8061: Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt}
  8062: |-
    So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.
    We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt}
  8063: |-
    You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.
    Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt}
  8064: |-
    Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.
    The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt}
  8065: |-
    You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  8066: |-
    We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  8067: |-
    You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.
    Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt}
  8068: Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt}
  8069: |-
    You also receive rank points for completing missions.
    Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt}
  8070: |-
    You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.
    Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}
  8071: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt}
  8072: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt}
  8073: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt}
  8074: Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt}
  8075: Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt}
  8076: Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt}
  8077: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt}
  8078: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt}
  8079: |-
    Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.
    If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt}
  8080: If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt}
  8081: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt}
  8082: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt}
  8083: There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt}
  8084: |-
    Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.

    I don't recall enlisting you as my tutor, thank you very much!

    Bostillette. You may go on ahead.

    Chief Bostillette!
    Eagerly have we awaited your return.${prompt}
  11978: Be this the person whom you've recruited to assist us?${prompt}
  11979: Affirmative. The aid ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] has volunteered shall prove pivotal to the strategy.${prompt}
  11980: |-
    Well met, good ${choice-player-gender}[sir/lady].
    My name is Pignoit, and I have the honor of serving under Chief Engineer Bostillette.${prompt}
  11981: Likewise for I, Fransont. Jolly good to have you on board!${prompt}
  11982: Sir. But moments ago word arrived from our Ghelsba-based operative.${prompt}
  11983: Fangmonger Zogbog has resurfaced at the Orcish stronghold.${prompt}
  11984: |-
    So, after an extended absence, the infamous military tactician-turned-research exponent finally makes his return...
    But we, the Iron Ram Engineers, shall be as a spanner thrown into the works of Zogbog's dastardly plans.
  11985: Allow me to explain the situation, ${name-player}. Some time ago, it came to light that the Orcs were conducting arcane research on powerful magic statues for use in warfare in the deepest interior of Fort Ghelsba.${prompt}
  11986: These constructs have been in development behind closed doors for the past two decades, and our intelligence operatives have brought alarming reports that their unveiling is nigh.${prompt}
  11987: 'There is no telling the destructive potential of the statues, but this much is certain: they must not be given the chance to wreak havoc upon the Kingdom.${prompt}'
  11988: Masterminding the development is Zogbog, whom we believe seeks to exact revenge for the Orcish defeat in the Crystal War.${prompt}
  11989: With the Royal Knight General's endorsement, we've devised a covert strategy to infiltrate the enemy's lair and destroy the statues before they can be used against us.${prompt}
  11990: The gravity of our mission is such that numerous safeguards have been employed to ensure the Orcs are kept ignorant of our plan.${prompt}
  11991: Even so, Chief, I fail to see the need for all involved to call each other by code names.${prompt}
  11992: Thus far it has proven to be a right royal pain when communicating with fellow strategy members.${prompt}
  11993: A valid concern, soldier. If you find not unpleasant the idea of joining the hapless souls who met with foul play during the Great War, then by all means wear your identity on your sleeve.${prompt}
  11994: <Gulp> R-remarkably well put, sir. Mayhap a little inconvenience would not kill me after all...literally.${prompt}
  11995: |-
    Hehehe, it gladdens me to see that you understand.
    Now then, the hour of reckoning draws nigh.${prompt}
  11996: Has the commander not yet arrived?${prompt}
  11997: If you seek Commander Excen--I mean, Maxcimille, he was seen striking for Ghelsba with a young lad in tow.${prompt}
  11998: Far be it from me to spread gossip, but I never imagined the commander had the time to rear a child, let alone take a woman to wife.${prompt}
  11999: Ah, yes. Hefting matching swords and wearing identical frowns, they were indeed a heartwarming sight to behold!${prompt}
  12000: Ohohoho. Verily, there is far more to our fearless leader than meets the eye.${prompt}
  12001: Now, without further ado, ${name-player}, pray make for Ghelsba and rejoin the commander and his young companion.${prompt}
  12002: There you will rendezvous with our operative and be furnished with additional information.${prompt}
  12003: I must needs see to the unit's final preparations, but shall be on my way presently.${prompt}

    Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom.
    It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!${prompt}

    In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign.

    King Kupofried was greatly dismayed.
    How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?${prompt}

  12105: Moniquaurie is my name, and I, too, am a native of Abyssea.${prompt}
  12106: There exist two cavernous maws here in the Jugner Forest, although you may have noted a difference.${prompt}
  12107: |-
    It intrigues me as to what has caused the one to be turned to stone.
    However, I haven't the luxury of time to be sating my own curiosities.${prompt}
  12108: The two of us have matters of far graver import to discuss.${prompt}
  12109: Firstly, you would do well to know that this maw is connected not to the Jugner Forest of Abyssea, but instead, the Vunkerl Inlet.${prompt}
  12110: Some have theorized that a dimensional misalignment has caused this, but you needn't rack your mind with academic ponderings.${prompt}
  12111: Are you familiar with the inlet? It is a place of beauty both wondrous and serene.${prompt}
  12112: But no more, for it was reft of its glorious vistas the day the sky turned crimson and hordes of abominations flooded the land.${prompt}
  12113: |-
    There is one thing I find puzzling, ${name-player}.
    You've seen with your own eyes the sickly state of Abyssea, yet you insist on going there. What is it that drives you?${prompt}
  12114: |-
    Whatever your answer is, keep it to yourself.
    It matters not whether your reason for setting foot in my home world be materialistic or altruistic.${prompt}
  12115: But enough pleasantries. I've come here for no other reason than to brief you on the current situation in Vunkerl, and brief you I shall.${prompt}
  12116: The resistance effort in the inlet is built around early model martellos whose functions are augmented via a central unit, the pulse martello. An outpost was secretly established especially for the purpose of housing the latter.${prompt}
  12117: |-
    Of late, however, the Abyssean hordes have taken to attacking the outpost with unnerving singleness of mind.
    We can only conclude that the enemy have somehow learned of its strategic importance.${prompt}
  12118: |-
    Our defenses have held up thus far, but cannot indefinitely repel such a determined enemy offensive.
    And to compound matters, Vunkerl's terrain places us at a distinct disadvantage against besiegers.${prompt}
  12119: |-
    Unless more people aid in the outpost's defense, the resistance effort in Vunkerl will surely end in failure.
    I myself would've long since leapt into the fray, but I share the same fate as Joachim and can no longer return home...${prompt}
  12120: |-
    What will you say?
    ${selection-lines}
    You just leave Vunkerl to me!
    I can help...I guess?${prompt}
  12121: |-
    Truly? You have my thanks, ${name-player}.
    Joachim's trust in you is well-founded, it'd seem.${prompt}
  12122: Before you cross over to Abyssea, however, there is one piece of knowledge you should take with you.${prompt}
  12123: |-
    There is a fell creature that has been terrorizing Vunkerl, a gargantuan beast identified as a ruszor.
    Countless soldiers and civilians alike have fallen prey to its dreadful tusks.${prompt}
  12124: I had heard that ruszors once thrived in great numbers in the Northlands, but were hunted to extinction soon after the Great War.${prompt}
  12125: |-
    How is it possible, then, that such a terrible specimen has survived to this day to now prowl the inlet, where none had been seen before?
    Could the destabilizing boundary between worlds spoken of by that Tarutaru be the culprit behind such inexplicable occurrences?${prompt}
  12126: |-
    When that oddball member of the Resistance put forth this theory, we all mocked him for a fool...but now I wonder.
    Regardless, I counsel you to avoid engaging that creature--the ruszor--until such time as you've acclimatized to Vunkerl's environs.${prompt}
  12127: |-
    Be careful out there, ${name-player}.
    I shall be praying for your success.${prompt}
  12128: Ah, so ${name-player} finally makes ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] triumphant return.${prompt}
  12129: |-
    Word of your amazing feat has preceded you.
    I can still scarce believe that you truly did it--that you put an end to the tusked menace!${prompt}
  12130: I had known that people of your world are possessed of strength far above we Abysseans, but even that seems an understatement in light of your achievements.${prompt}
  12131: |-
    I can now rest easier in the knowledge that a terrible abomination threatens my people no more.

    As I am permanently stranded upon this world, I no longer have a use for it.
    May it serve you well upon the battlefield that is Abyssea.${prompt}
  12136: Thanks to the efforts of stalwarts such as you, we were able to acquire new intelligence from communities that had been surviving in isolation.${prompt}
  12137: |-
    Of the things we've learned, however, some were too terrible to be made known to the masses.
    The hope that has sprouted among the survivors is yet too fragile to bear such knowledge.${prompt}
  12138: I gravely fear for what will become of my home, yet I am stranded here, powerless to lift even a finger.${prompt}
  12139: I shall never again lay eyes upon Abyssea.${prompt}
  12140: But through your eyes, I can almost glimpse it in all its glory and majesty--the way it was before the cataclysm befell.${prompt}

  12195: The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called “Voidwalkers.” Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt}
  12196: |-
    Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.
    This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt}
  12197: Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt}
  12198: A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt}
  12199: Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt}
  12200: |-
    Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.
    Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt}
  12201: Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt}
  12202: Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt}
  12203: However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt}
  12204: |-
    When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.
    These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt}
  12205: Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt}
  12206: The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt}
  12207: |-
    Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.
    Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt}
  12208: As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt}
  12209: Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt}
  12210: Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt}
  12211: After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt}
  12212: Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt}
  12213: Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  12214: While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  12215: Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt}
  12216: Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt}
  12217: Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt}
  12218: Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt}
  12219: Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt}
  12220: The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt}
  12221: The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt}
  12222: Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt}
  12223: 'Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt}'

    By infusing atmacite to one's body using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.${prompt}
  12225: Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}
  12226: Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.${prompt}
  12227: Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.${prompt}
  12228: As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.${prompt}
  12229: Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.${prompt}
  12230: 'Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level ${number: 0}.${prompt}'

  13014: |-
    How about I let you in on some trade secrets?
    All I ask is that you refrain from sharing them with every Tomasa, Dixon, and Harith.${prompt}
  13015: |-
    What will you do?
    ${selection-lines}
    Purchase ${item-plural: 0[2]}.
    Ask about a secret weapon.
    Inquire about pulse panoplia.
    Walk away. Far away.${prompt}
  13016: 'Pulse Panoplia is the term our researchers have bestowed upon a specific set of equipment that emits an entrancing luminescence, such as ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  13017: Our brightest minds in the experimental field of Opticogradiology have succeeded in stabilizing the particles that constitute the source of this enigmatic light, a phenomenon which is often referred to as a “pulse.”${prompt}
  13018: Therefore, as you may have inferred, pulse panoplia are the visual structures yielded by such procedures. I use the phrase “visual structures” here because these pulses do not technically possess a singular, concrete form.${prompt}
  13019: |-
    The details of these pulses are highly classified, and I am not at liberty to make them privy to the rank and file.
    While you may not have access to all the particulars on them, you will surely encounter these particle aggregates on the field of battle.${prompt}
  13020: |-
    Much like the legendary swords of the Far East, it is not the adventurer who chooses the pulse panoplia, but the pulse that chooses to initiate an exclusive bond with its owner.
    In the past, if one tried to bequeath such equipment to a comrade...${prompt}
  13021: The pulse would dissolve in an instant, leaving the recipient with naught but a feeling of dissatisfaction.${prompt}
  13022: |-
    However, our passionate scientists have finally uncovered a method by which to permanently regulate the activity of these pulses.
    They worked day-in and day-out, and their lives suffered as a consequence; they forgot their families, friends, and all other obligations.${prompt}
  13023: '...But I digress.${prompt}'
  13024: |-
    If pulses disperse when handed to a new owner, then it follows that all one need do is regather the particles and restabilize them.
    The reasoning involved is quite elementary, my dear ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13025: |-
    “How does one go about procuring these pulse particles,” you ask?
    An astute question for someone of such a brutish vocation. I could lecture for hours concerning this unfathomably deep topic...but I won't.${prompt}
  13026: For brevity's sake, I shall cite only the most basic facts that delineate their connection to Voidwatchers.${prompt}
  13027: |-
    It is well documented that pulses exhibit a certain response in the presence of stratum abyssite.
    Thus, it stands to reason that anyone in possession of said abyssite would collect pulse particles in the form of pulse cells.${prompt}
  13028: Sadly, that is neither the final nor most difficult step here. Reconstruction is the most integral aspect of the process.${prompt}
  13029: Our studies have shown that pulse particles lose a vast amount of their energy as heat and other byproducts of dispersion, meaning it is empirically impossible to restore a pulse to its former level of effectiveness.${prompt}
  13030: |-
    By the by, I may have promised a brief explanation, but those are hard to come by when such vast stores of knowledge are involved.
    Returning to the matter at hand...${prompt}
  13031: The essence of what I'm trying to convey is that a one-to-one ratio of pre- to post-dispersion pulses is simply not viable.${prompt}
  13032: Notice how I qualified “ratio” with “one-to-one.” While individual pulses may lack potency, it is possible to augment that dearth with additional pulses.${prompt}
  13033: 'The latest double-blind, peer-reviewed experiment conducted at our research center determined that at least ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[post-dispersion pulse is/post-dispersion pulses are] needed to replicate the power of an original one.${prompt}'
  13034: As a corollary, though, I must add that one cannot go around collecting any old cells and expect to recreate a masterpiece as delicate as a pulse; the pulse cells you acquire must all be of the same ilk.${prompt}
  13035: 'Once you obtain ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[pulse cell/pulse cells], all you have to do is relinquish them to me. I shall do my utmost to reconstruct the pulse panoplia of my--<ahem> your dreams.${prompt}'
  13036: |-
    That is, if you possess the necessary faculties for a pulse to initiate a bond with you.
    Hopefully my explanation didn't fly too high over that microscopic brain of yours, although I never tire of conversing on this subject.${prompt}
  13037: |-
    You truly want to know about our latest innovation?
    I suppose it is technology's job to assist physically challenged specimens like you and turn them into powerful pugilists.${prompt}
  13038: Perhaps it would be wrong to place an inordinate amount of blame on you, though, seeing as these fiends hail from another dimension.${prompt}
  13039: |-
    As you probably don't recall, there are five distinct chronospatial shifts that factor into Voidwalker combat that we term “phases.”
    If we are to defeat these extra-planar perambulators, we must utilize the full spectrum of these rifts by--${prompt}
  13040: |-
    Yes, aligning with your foe. So it would seem you are not completely illiterate on this subject.
    Providing remedial courses to cranially challenged individuals is malms beneath me, however. If you need a refresher on the science behind alignment, go harass a Voidwatch Officer.${prompt}
  13041: All I'll say on this topic is that alignment is analogous to a cross-dimensional bridge.${prompt}
  13042: |-
    What a fitting analogy, if I do say so myself.
    These monstrosities start out as massive crevasses separating you and your contingent from the sweet nectar of victory, but once the bridge is completed, the path to victory is vastly more accessible.${prompt}
  13043: |-
    And what, pray tell, is the name of the extraordinary artifact that lays the foundation for this metaphorical bridge to triumph?
    Why, none other than the ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}
  13044: |-
    A splendid name for a splendid invention, wouldn't you agree?
    Simply place ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} within the proximity of a planar rift, and gaze in awe at the resulting ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}, which should make the power of your ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} surge exponentially!${prompt}
  13045: 'Furthermore, deploying ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} at the beginning of battle will precipitate shifts in phase alignment.${prompt}'
  13046: These special shifts then significantly alter the alignment's effects, thus inhibiting the most deadly aspects of your Voidwalker enemy.${prompt}
  13047: I doubt someone outside of avant-garde research circles such as you can fully conceptualize the plethora of mechanisms that comprise this sublime process, but perhaps a more perspicuous way to state the consequences would be “The baddies get weaker.”${prompt}
  13048: Keep in mind, however, you must manually catalyze any alignment shifts you wish to exploit.${prompt}
  13049: |-
    One of these alone will not make a significant difference in battle.
    Don't start complaining to me, though, for our efforts to eliminate this defect are already well underway.${prompt}
  13050: 'At any rate, while one ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} may be insufficient, adventurers are allowed to carry up to ${number: 1} at a time.${prompt}'
  13051: |-
    Why that few!? Anyone with even the most rudimentary understanding of chronospatial alignment could deduce that an excess of these objects could destabilize nearby planar rifts and cause irreparable damage to the surrounding area!
    Besides, no one would need more than ${number: 1} per operation anyway.${prompt}
  13052: |-
    Oh, and don't think that I'll just be giving these away!
    You're lucky you're not being charged for the privilege of listening to my scholarly discourse!${prompt}
  13053: |-
    I may be loath to admit it, but we desperately need the money to continue researching and developing these artifacts.
    There still is an alarming dearth of data on the items' negative side effects--vis-a-vis planar rifts--that must still be addressed.${prompt}
  13054: |-
    There you have it; our secret weapon.
    I suggest relying on it as little as possible, though, in case the Voidwalkers ever develop an immunity to it.${prompt}
  13055: 'As for the pecuniary particulars, I''d say ${number: 1} gil for one ${item-singular: 0[2]} is a fair price.${prompt}'
  13056: 'Remember, ${item-plural: 0[2]} are in short supply, so there is a requisite waiting period after purchases.${prompt}'

  13060: Enter a number between 0 and 99.${prompt}
  13061: |-
    You wanted ${number: 0}, correct?
    That'll be ${number: 1} gil, for simpletons who don't pay attention.${prompt}

    Let the reconstruction begin.

  13071: |-
    <Sigh>...
    You haven't the requisite amount of ${item-plural: 0[2]}, you lackwit. I'll need ${number: 1} of them in order to ensure a successful reconstruction.${prompt}
  13072: |-
    If only you would listen.
    I believe I explicitly stated that pulse panoplia choose their owner, not the other way around. You simply don't possess the necessary fortitude to be chosen by this pulse.${prompt}
  13073: |-
    Ugh, will your stupidity never cease?
