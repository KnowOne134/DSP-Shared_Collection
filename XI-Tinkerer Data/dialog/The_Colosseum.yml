  11623: “Feral skills” is the collective term used when referring to the various abilities and attributes assigned to monsters participating in Pankration.${prompt}
  11624: Some feral skills have job, monster family, and level restrictions and cannot be assigned to monsters who do not meet certain requirements.${prompt}
  11625: In addition, most feral skills have levels, with higher-level skills yielding better results. However, keep in mind that there are some feral skills which never increase in level.${prompt}
  11626: Feral skills will generally improve after a monster's continued participation in Pankration events.${prompt}
  11627: While most monsters possess no feral skills upon capture, there are rare cases when a subject will already be blessed with one or two skills.${prompt}

  11629: 'FP is the abbreviation for ${color: 5}feral points${color: 1}. These points are used when assigning feral skills to monsters.${prompt}'
  11630: Assigning a feral skill requires a certain amount of a monster's total FP capacity. Generally speaking, the more powerful a skill, the more FP will be required when assigning it.${prompt}
