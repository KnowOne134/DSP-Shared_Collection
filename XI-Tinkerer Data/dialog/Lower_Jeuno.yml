  7113: An invisible, mystical energy resides within your weapon. I would explain the n-n-nature of this energy in more detail, but I fear it is beyond the comprehension of a layperson.${prompt}
  7114: Wh-what? You doubt my kn-kn-knowledge on the subject!?${prompt}

  7142: Hi. I'm Aldo, head of Tenshodo. We deal in things you can't buy anywhere else. Take your time and have a look around.${prompt}
  7143: So you're the new diplomatic attaché. What, you've got a secret message from the archduke? Well, let me see it.${prompt}
  7144: I see. Thanks for getting this to me. It says I'm supposed to tell you about magicite.${prompt}
  7145: Magicite is found deep inside Castle Oztroja, Davoi, and Beadeaux. But those places are thick with beastmen, and those beastmen are quite cunning.${prompt}
  7146: You'll need this to get inside Beadeaux.${prompt}
  7147: Aldo...${prompt}
  7148: What is it, Verena? Can't you see I have a guest?${prompt}
  7149: I know. That's what it's about.${prompt}
  7150: I heard that the archduke has made a statement...${prompt}
  7151: He's ordered all beastmen out of Jeuno. He must not think it's safe to have them around anymore.${prompt}
  7152: What? I think those creeps in the palace are a lot worse than any beastmen we have here!${prompt}
  7153: It's like they're wearing masks...you can't tell what they're thinking. And their eyes are like cold stones. You're not gonna follow that order, are you?${prompt}
  7154: Well, I know how you feel, but with beastmen on the rampage out there, you can't blame people for feeling jittery about the ones in here.${prompt}
  7155: You've heard about all that, haven't you?${prompt}
  7156: Yeah, I've heard. But the beastmen in town haven't ever hurt anybody!${prompt}
  7157: I know that, Verena... But I don't think the average Jeunoan would agree.${prompt}
  7158: No...${prompt}
  7159: Maybe it's the wise thing to do. You know, taking action before things get out of hand.${prompt}
  7160: Well, I'll see if I can think up a better alternative. Don't worry. I'd be the last guy to chase them out of town.${prompt}
  7161: Okay. You promised, remember!${prompt}
  7162: Verena...${prompt}
  7163: Fickie!${prompt}

  7165: Fickie... Are you all right?${prompt}
  7166: That's a weird thing to ask. I'm always all right. How about you? You look pale!${prompt}
  7167: Oh, um... No. No, I'm fine.${prompt}
  7168: Oh, all right. Well, let's get going!${prompt}
  7169: Um, okay.${prompt}
  7170: Magicite is found deep inside Castle Oztroja, Davoi, and Beadeaux. Those places are thick with murderous beastmen, and their traps are cunning.${prompt}
  7171: There's not a rumor that doesn't find its way to Jeuno. I bet you can find what you need from other adventurers. May your strength never falter!${prompt}
  7172: What? You say the beastmen might be plotting something else? Yeah, it wouldn't be like them to just give up.${prompt}
  7173: I don't want anything to do with beastmen anymore. I bet the old Goblin Muckvix knows more, but you'd have to ask him yourself.${prompt}
  7174: Verena's really worried about Fickblix. Better not mention beastmen around her.${prompt}
  7175: I wonder who's worse, us or them? Fickie's never done anything bad at all.${prompt}
  7176: Just 'cause they're not human doesn't mean we should hate them. Even a kid like Fickie gets treated like dirt.${prompt}
  7177: I don't know what's right or wrong anymore. I can't help anybody. I'm sorry.${prompt}
  7178: What? Fickie's seeds started to grow? Hey, what's that gotta do with me, huh?${prompt}
  7179: '''Course I don''t like war. But that ain''t the same thing.${prompt}'
  7180: Hey, I'm a beastie. I ain't tellin' you zilch if it'd hurt my peoples.${prompt}
  7181: So, Fickblix's seeds started to sprout...${prompt}
  7182: Aldo, I...${prompt}
  7183: Verena, I heard your flowers started to sprout. I bet all you kids gave it lots of water. That kind of seed doesn't take root that easily.${prompt}
  7184: Maybe everything you and Fickblix acomplished really did mean something.${prompt}
  7185: Recently I... I haven't been watering it. I thought of nothing but myself. I'm so sorry, Fickie.${prompt}
  7186: Yeah, maybe it's not a question of what's right and what's wrong.${prompt}
  7187: Nothing would be better than averting another conflict... For us, and for them.${prompt}
  7188: All right! I don't know what we can do, but I'll help. Fickie would never forgive us if we just stood silent.${prompt}
  7189: That's right! The least we can do is try.${prompt}
  7190: But I don't know if we can find out what their little group is up to.${prompt}
  7191: I guess we could ask Muckvix.${prompt}
  7192: But would he help? He always tries to stay out of these racial matters.${prompt}
  7193: And if he told us anything, he'd be betraying his own kind.${prompt}
  7194: Yeah, I know. But there's nothing else we can do. ${name-player}, would you mind asking Muckvix? We'll head there later.${prompt}
  7195: Hey, I ain't got nuttin' to say to ya. Scram.${prompt}
  7196: We need your help, too, Muckvix.${prompt}
  7197: Oh, so you're in this too, huh? Whaddaya tryin' to pull here?${prompt}
  7198: Please, Muck. You're our only hope. Jeuno--no, the entire world is in danger unless you tell us.${prompt}
  7199: Hey, I've been livin' here for ages, but when it comes down to it, I'm just a beastie, ain't I?${prompt}
  7200: You ain't gonna get nuttin' outta me. See, we beasties are all brudders.${prompt}
  7201: Muck, you don't think of us as your own, but those kids and I helped Fickie's seeds grow... To us, people and beastmen are the same. We're all one and the same!${prompt}
  7202: And now, the chance for peace is in danger. Please, Muck, tell us!${prompt}
  7203: Chance for peace, huh? Aw, that Fickie... What would he do if he was here?${prompt}
  7204: Aw, what the hell. But just this once! And only 'cause I owe your father. May my peoples forgive me...${prompt}
  7205: Okay, so the crew you're lookin' for's always been kinda cold to us.${prompt}
  7206: They're just a bunch of tough guys, but sometimes they go buck wild. I heard they're growin' into a big mob, so they must be up to somethin'!${prompt}
  7207: Try lookin' around the Eldieme Necropolis. I heard the bums who left Davoi are layin' low there. And I ain't gonna say nuttin' more!${prompt}
  7208: Thanks, Muck!${prompt}
  7209: Muckvix, thanks a million.${prompt}

  7237: Next time you come to Jeuno, think of the special evening when you gave light to its streets.${prompt}

  7402: He's at his own crossroads. He has to figure it out for himself.${prompt}
  7403: Have you heard of Lewenhart?${prompt}
  7404: Everywhere he goes, fantastic melodies follow. He is the bard for all bards, a legend among our kind.${prompt}
  7405: He should still be wandering somewhere out there, but nobody has seen him for ages.${prompt}
  7406: Someone of his stature could easily settle down and live quite comfortably. Perhaps he'll keep wandering his whole life. Who knows what thoughts such a creative mind entertains?${prompt}

  7412: Well, anyway... I bet those bitter lyrics would rrreally cheer up the broken-hearted.${prompt}
  7413: Oh, you've been to Buburimu? They say couples descend on the place at nightfall. How do they dodge the monsterrrs?${prompt}

  7420: Now, now, my young friend. What's all that fuss? Come, let me get you something.${prompt}

  7424: No it ain't! Nobody cares about such an oldie.${prompt}
  7425: Well, my apologies, but have you ever even tried it? Just because it's old doesn't mean it's not good, you know.${prompt}
  7426: Hmm...${prompt}
  7427: Just give it a try. What have you got to lose?${prompt}
  7428: Good to see you again.${prompt}
  7429: I have a feeling we'll meet again. I hope by then you'll have learned to appreciate this song.${prompt}
  7430: I've seen him before, somewhere...${prompt}
  7431: Who does he think he is? He doesn't know a thing about all the pain I've gone through!${prompt}
  7432: Wait, could he be...? Naw, he couldn't be.${prompt}

  7447: I was just playing with Verena, but she's feeling down. And I know why.${prompt}
  7448: The beasties outside town are getting restless. That makes Verena worried. So I'm going to Oztroja and ask them to settle down.${prompt}
  7449: I think the beasties outside can get along with people, like I could with Verena. I really believe so.${prompt}
  7450: Yeah, maybe you got a point there.${prompt}

  7458: Fickie? Is Fickie here?${prompt}
  7459: Hey, you just missed him. Said somethin' about goin' to Castle Oztroja. You didn't see him on your way in here?${prompt}
  7460: No, it's just... Some adventurers said they were going out to hunt beastmen, so I got so worried...${prompt}
  7461: I always told him to stay here in town. I told him if people found him in a dungeon somewhere, they might mistake him for a bad beastman, and then they'd...${prompt}
  7462: Ain't nothin' you can do. That kid's a beastie, and even the people in this town give us the cold shoulder.${prompt}
  7463: Well, he don't belong out there none neither... But I still think he's safer out there than in here.${prompt}
  7464: I'm so worried about him.${prompt}
  7465: That girl understands things that only us beasties do. Maybe Fickie and her can break down the walls that keep us apart.${prompt}

  7644: I heard that poor chocobo master's son got sick. Now he's got to watch over both his son and his chocobos. Poor guy...${prompt}
  7645: Did you hear? He lost his wife after she got sick a long time ago. He was so poor, he couldn't afford any medicine for her.${prompt}
  7646: He got so scary after she died.${prompt}
  7647: I heard that the chocobo master's son got better. Sometimes I hear him laughing again.${prompt}

  7649: Yeah, really!${prompt}

  7658: Lion came, so something must be up. I'd like to get out there and do some fighting myself, but I'm stuck here until Boss gives the order.${prompt}
  7659: I couldn't believe it when Boss came back carrying Lady Verena. He looked like he had been run over by a stampede of chocobos.${prompt}
  7660: I wonder what the hell happened up there at Delkfutt's Tower... No, on second thought, don't tell me. I don't want to know.${prompt}
  7661: Lately, Boss has got that look in his eyes... You know, the one that makes your spine tingle with fear.${prompt}
  7662: |-
    Well, all's well that ends well.
    I like you and all, but just between you and me, I'm against you joining us. I don't want to have to compete against an adventurer of your caliber!${prompt}
  7663: Watch your back. Our boss, Aldo, is a rrreal pirate. I can be quite a scoundrel, too, but I ain't nothing compared to him.${prompt}
  7664: You follow me, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady]? Whenever Aldo's deep in thought, it's best to just look the other way.${prompt}
  7665: After all, he's seen hell with those eyes. Of course, lots of people suffered in the wars twenty years ago, but most of them never came back.${prompt}
  7666: Somehow Verena seems different than the other girls. Some folks say she can rrread animals' minds.${prompt}
  7667: She's a fine chocobo rrrider, and unlike my boss, she gets along fine with those beastmen. Those two always fight about that.${prompt}
  7668: Hey, you made it through! Thanks for the package. Now, go back and get paid.${prompt}
  7669: Hey, you made it through! But look at this junk. It's trash! Next time go easier on the goods, okay?${prompt}

  7672: Hey, did you hear? Verena is missing and our boss is in a mess over it. If you ask me, I think they just had another one of their sibling quarrels.${prompt}
  7673: The other day when Lion came, she was in and out of here like a white rrrabbit on a full moon. I wonder what she could be up to?${prompt}
  7674: Verena was at Delkfutt's Tower!? And I thought that she and the boss had just had a fight... Boy, am I an idiot!${prompt}
  7675: Boss is talking about setting off on some adventure. You're going too, aren't you? It must be something rrreally big if they didn't ask me to come along.${prompt}
  7676: I can't do much for you, but good luck out there. Wouldn't want to see you lose any of your nine lives.${prompt}
  7677: Welcome back. From the looks of it, you had a pretty tough time out there... But that's about all I know. Boss never tells us about anything that goes on...${prompt}

    But as long as you are okay...
    Ahem! Don't be a stranger, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7679: If only Lion were okay, as well...${prompt}

  7681: We ain't cheap, but you get what you pay for! Take your time, have a look around, see if there's somethin' you like.${prompt}
  7682: Our boss looks all hairy-scary, but he caves in to his sister Verena all the time.${prompt}
  7683: Verena's a really nice girl. We all think she's super-duper swell.${prompt}
  7684: But don't you lay a single-wingle finger on her. People who do... Well, they have a tendency to be found dead, floating off the pier. So please, keep that in mind.${prompt}

    You mean, it was that bad...?
    Okay, just forget that I asked.${prompt}
  7700: Lady-wady Verena's bak in tip-top shape? That's great! Maybe I should go in and see how she's doing... But what if she's forgotten who I was!?${prompt}
  7701: The boss told me to get his equipment ready-steady. But, when I asked him where he was going, he told me to mind my own busy-business!${prompt}
  7702: This is great! This is stupendous! I have a feeling that everything will finally-winally go back to being the way it was!${prompt}

  7732: And they're a great way to break the ice with strangers, don't you think?${prompt}
  7733: I heard Jeuno began about eighty years ago when fishermen settled here. It was just a tiny fishing village back then.${prompt}
  7734: As you can see from any map, Jeuno lies on a crossroads binding the three nations together. A hub of commerce, Jeuno grew wealthy.${prompt}
  7735: Soon it was filled with the bustle of buyer and seller. Our humble district captures that particular energy better than any other.${prompt}
  7736: Huh? What am I doing here? I'm looking for work! I got fired from my last place. Something about talking too much...${prompt}

  7792: Perhaps one day we can face each other in open-hand combat. A glorious fight that would be, don't you think?${prompt}
  7793: You call yourself ${name-player}? Well, I've never heard of you. You may be somebody in your little hometown, but things are different here.${prompt}
  7794: All roads lead to Jeuno. It's not easy to make a name for yourself with all these people here.${prompt}
  7795: If you're really so famous back home, then word should reach here eventually. For now, just finish what you've started. Fame and fortune should follow.${prompt}
  7796: ${name-player}, eh? Hmm... That name is vaguely familiar...${prompt}
  7797: But I'm afraid few in this town have heard of you. Just keep working at it. You'll make a name for yourself eventually.${prompt}
  7798: Oh, so you're ${name-player}... Yes, I heard some travelers in a tavern talk about you. It seems you've a fair reputation.${prompt}
  7799: If you keep doing whatever you're doing, I'm sure more Jeunoans will come seeking your help. Good luck.${prompt}
  7800: Hello, ${name-player}! I hear your name mentioned quite often these days. You've done well, my friend. Keep at it.${prompt}
  7801: Hello, ${name-player}! A good deal of people here in Jeuno know about you!${prompt}
  7802: And they all say you're quite the do-gooder! Thank you for serving our fair city. Keep up the good work!${prompt}

    Welcome to the auction house.
    Do you have any questions about our establishment?${prompt}
  7810: |-
    What do you want to know?
    ${selection-lines}
    What is the auction house?
    How are auctions run?
    Are there any fees?
    Are there any limits?
    How do you check up on merchandise?
    How do you remove an item?
    My “Sales Status” list is full!
    Nothing right now.${prompt}
  7811: Auction houses can be found in all of Vana'diel's major cities. Here adventurers gather to bid on battle spoils, unwanted items, old armor...almost anything.${prompt}
  7812: Currently, the auction houses in Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno all work independently. Therefore, prices differ from city to city.${prompt}
  7813: Adventurers may use any auction house regardless of nationality.${prompt}
  7814: The first adventurer to bid at or above the asking price will automatically purchase the product.${prompt}
  7815: Once put up for auction, merchandise will remain there for a maximum of thirty weeks Vana'diel time (nine-and-a-half days Earth time).${prompt}
  7816: If merchandise does not sell within this time limit, it will be returned to the seller's current residence.${prompt}
  7817: Transaction fees are proportional to the amount for which an item is put up on auction. The method of calculating this fee is different for single items and stackable items.${prompt}
  7818: A transaction fee is collected when any merchandise is put up for auction. This fee is nonrefundable.${prompt}
  7819: The International Auction House Committee, or IAHC, has declared that a maximum of seven items may be put up for auction at one time.${prompt}
  7820: However, the IAHC has recently removed the limit to how many items one may purchase.${prompt}
  7821: A small amount of time is required before new merchandise appears on our bid list.${prompt}
  7822: Once an item appears on your “Sales Status” list, it may not immediately appear on the bid list. If you do not see your item on the bid list, try looking again at a later time.${prompt}
  7823: If you would like to withdraw an item from an auction, you must travel to the auction house, and select “Stop Sale” from the “Sales Status” menu.${prompt}
  7824: To remove an item from your “Sales Status” list, you must visit an auction counter to acknowledge the sale or return of your merchandise.${prompt}
  7825: Otherwise, previously sold or returned items will fill up your list and prevent you from selling any more merchandise.${prompt}
  7826: At any auction counter, open the “Sales Status” menu and acknowledge the transaction to clear it from the list.${prompt}
  7827: Press the confirm button to remove any transaction colored yellow (sold) or red (returned).${prompt}
  7828: Is there anything else you would like to know?${prompt}
  7829: In the past, many have amassed great wealth through the auction house. I hope you find fortune, too!${prompt}

    Well, ladies and gentlemen, are we all here?
    Allow me to introduce myself. I am Vauderame.${prompt}
  7909: I don't possess a talent for witty repartee as do most of my fellow Elvaan, so I will get straight to the point.${prompt}
  7910: Firstly, I wonder if you have heard of the group known as Atarefaunet's band?${prompt}
  7911: Also known as the Scarlet Thunder of La Theine, rrright?${prompt}
  7912: The Scarlet what?${prompt}
  7913: A bit before your time, young one? You need to study more.${prompt}
  7914: It was a group of thieves that once terrorized merchants on the roads between San d'Oria, Bastok, and Jeuno, stealing damn huge amounts of money and goods.${prompt}
  7915: '...Traveling merchants would quake in fear at the mere mention of that damn name...${prompt}'
  7916: It would seem the veterans among you are well-versed in thieving history.${prompt}
  7917: During the Great War, the leader of the band, Atarefaunet, was killed by a traitor and the rest of the members scattered to the winds.${prompt}
  7918: However, the Tenshodo has managed to divine the current whereabouts of the remaining members.${prompt}

    Why would you want us to do that? Do you mean to bring them together to form a new thieving group?
    ...Damn!${prompt}
  7921: |-
    No, of course not.
    What could thieves of twenty years ago accomplish now?${prompt}
  7922: Nevertheless, it would not be wise to leave them to their own devices. It's possible that some amongst them might seek to regain the glory of the past.${prompt}
  7923: The Tenshodo simply wishes to measure their intentions. If those members plan on beginning any activities, we ask that they inform us about it.${prompt}
  7924: '...That is the main point of the message in the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  7925: However, it is not certain that they will just meekly sign the papers. My job is to make certain these brigands follow the will of the Tenshodo.${prompt}
  7926: And that is where you come in. Use your knowledge and talents to get those signatures and bring them back here to me.${prompt}
  7927: I will now hand each of you a sealed envelope. Seek out the member whose name is revealed therein.${prompt}
  7928: Lastly, it is against thieving etiquette to sneak a look at the members assigned to people other than yourself. As I'm sure you are aware, too much knowledge is a dangerous thing in this business...${prompt}
  7929: Now, please come to me one at a time to receive your envelope.${prompt}
  7930: You are the adventurer thief ${name-player}?${prompt}

  7993: Hey, what are you tryin' to pull? Get lost!${prompt}
  7994: Sorry, I'm busy. Something awful has happened, and it'll take one helluva beastmaster to sort it out.${prompt}
  7995: Perfect timing! We were hoping to find a renowned beastmaster like you to take care of a little problem.${prompt}
  7996: You see, the beasts who inhabit Eldieme are acting strange lately. It's like they're under someone's control. They've attacked adventurers, and recently killed one!${prompt}
  7997: People suspect we beastmasters have something to do with it. You should know we'd never do anything like that. Won't you look into this for us?${prompt}

    Not right now.${prompt}
  8000: I knew you would! Many skilled beastmasters have gone, but none have returned. Maybe they've fallen to whatever is controlling the beasts!${prompt}
  8001: 'Take ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to protect yourself. Ask Osker in the stables in Upper Jeuno to help you.${prompt}'

  8016: Good luck, and don't just dump it at some auction house, all right?${prompt}
  8017: Hmm... Maybe you're right. But I don't think I can bring myself to do it!${prompt}
  8018: It's too precious to throw into the garbage. No, it needs a more peaceful resting place, like the Water of Oblivion in Ranguemont Pass.${prompt}
  8019: You threw it in? Thank you! My heart feels at peace, knowing that my ordeal is behind me. Please, take this in thanks.${prompt}
  8020: Perhaps everything is as full of memories as that bracelet... Should someone find it a hundred years hence, what shall they feel?${prompt}
  8021: Yes, maybe such feelings do not diminish with the flow of time. Oh, what a moving thought!${prompt}
  8022: Perhaps my heartfelt pain will live on in my song. Such is the life of a bard!${prompt}

  8029: Say, how about that task I told you about?${prompt}
  8030: Good, this will do nicely. Now for the task! I want you to visit the grave of a great bard of yesteryear and pray for him.${prompt}
  8031: Why, you ask? I don't know; it's just something we always do. They say he met a tragic end. Go ask other bards if you want to learn about him.${prompt}
  8032: His stone sarcophagus is deep inside the Eldieme Necropolis. It's one of several, and I can't remember which. Well, you'll find it.${prompt}
  8033: 'A little investigation will reveal which one is his. Purify it with that ${item-singular: 0[2]} and play the requiem. You don''t know the tune? It''s okay, just go!${prompt}'
  8034: Huh? The bard interred inside Eldieme? Yeah, he was executed in San d'Oria for committing a serious crime!${prompt}
  8035: So you're off to pray at his grave, huh? Be careful! You never know what evil lurks in those halls!${prompt}
  8036: 'Oh, did you take the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and play the requiem? The task isn''t complete until you''ve done both!${prompt}'
  8037: Good work, ${name-player}! Yeah, sorry I didn't tell you about the monsters. Otherwise nobody would go! Understand?${prompt}
  8038: Huh? After that a man came and gave you a ring? I hope he wasn't a grave robber!${prompt}
  8039: But don't give that ring to me; I hate antiques. Anyway, here's your reward. Thanks again!${prompt}
  8040: Well, that's out of the way. Now who should I ask for the next task? Bards can be so selfish sometimes!${prompt}
  8041: So, what did you do with that ring? Maybe it's valuable. I'd ask a collector if I were you. Of course, he might just say it's worthless...${prompt}
  8042: You have emerged as a hero to the people of Jeuno. Just the sound of your name strikes courage into their hearts.${prompt}
  8043: As a representative of its citizens, I humbly ask you to continue your efforts for the good of the Duchy.${prompt}

    Conquests.
    Conquest results.
    Donating crystals.
    Conquest points.
    The effects of controlling regions.
    Regions controlled by other nations.
    Regions under beastman control.${prompt}
  8060: All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt}
  8061: Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt}
  8062: Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt}
  8063: So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt}
  8064: |-
    Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.
    They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt}
  8065: Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt}
  8066: Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt}
  8067: |-
    So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.
    We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt}
  8068: |-
    You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.
    Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt}
  8069: |-
    Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.
    The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt}
  8070: |-
    You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  8071: |-
    We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  8072: |-
    You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.
    Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt}
  8073: Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt}
  8074: |-
    You also receive rank points for completing missions.
    Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt}
  8075: |-
    You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.
    Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}
  8076: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt}
  8077: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt}
  8078: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt}
  8079: Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt}
  8080: Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt}
  8081: Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt}
  8082: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt}
  8083: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt}
  8084: |-
    Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.
    If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt}
  8085: If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt}
  8086: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt}
  8087: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt}
  8088: There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt}
  8089: |-
    Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.
    Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.${prompt}

  8474: As much as I'd love you to join us here at the Tenshodo, I think I already know your answer to that offer. But if you're ever in the neighborhood, be sure to drop by. You're always welcome.${prompt}
  8475: |-
    Well, I think it's time I took that vacation I've been promising myself. You should go someplace quiet and get some rest as well.
    I have a feeling that the real adventure has just begun...${prompt}
  8476: A lot has happened in the past few months... I don't know how long the news of the archduke and his brother is going to stay a secret, but that has nothing to do with me or the Tenshodo.${prompt}
  8477: |-
    What to do now? Maybe I'll get myself a boat and sail around Vana'diel...
    Good luck on your journeys, ${name-player}, and may fortune smile upon you always!${prompt}

  8482: Runga-Kopunga! What brings you here?${prompt}
  8483: Runga-Kopunga?${prompt}

    Last nightaru...

  8487: Oh, baby-baby! We've gotta go go go for it!${prompt}
  8488: Don't keep me hangin' on the line of a yo-yo-yo. You've got to take action on my reaction! Think of the possibilities I can offer!${prompt}
  8489: (What does he mean, “go go go for it”? Is he going to take Chululu away...?)${prompt}
  8490: You know, you are rightaru! I'm getting tired of the same old same old.${prompt}
  8491: Ba～by-baby! That's what I wanted to hear. I'll be waiting for you at...you-know-where. Ta-taru!${prompt}

  8494: (But I can't just letaru her run off with some guy...)${prompt}
  8495: Um... Hypothetically speaking, if you loved someone, and that someone was about to go far, far away, what would you do? Would you tell ${choice-player-gender}[her/him] that you loved ${choice-player-gender}[her/him]? Hypothetically speaking, of course.${prompt}

    Would you express your lovey-wuvy?

  8498: I mean...hypothetically speaking, of course. I was just wondering. This has nothing to do with me.${prompt}
  8499: I knew it! That's exactly-factly what I would have said! But you know, we would regret it in the long run...${prompt}
  8500: (I've got to tell her how I feel... But no... I just couldn't do it...)${prompt}
  8501: Oh, what should I do!? I don't want to regretaru not telling her, but what if she laughed at me? I could never-ever face her again!${prompt}
  8502: 'Please, ${name-player}! You''ve got to go to the Boyahda Tree and get that ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! A miracle is my only hope!${prompt}'

  8506: This had better be good, Kurou. What if a customer was to come while we were out here chatting away?${prompt}
  8507: |-
    I...
    I want you to know how...how I feel.${prompt}
  8508: How you what!?${prompt}

    I...
    I want to continue working here with you, side by side. I don't want you to go!${prompt}

    Going off?

  8515: |-
    Hey, baby-baby! Honey-honey!
    Now that I think of it, that “do” is perfect for “you.”${prompt}
  8516: Hold on, m-mister! Who do you think you are, getting all chummy-wummy with my Chululu!?${prompt}
  8517: Would you control yourself, Kurou! This is my hair stylist, Runga-Kopunga. He's been telling me these past few days that I should get my hair done.${prompt}
  8518: I've been trying my best to convince her to let me work my mastery, but she just keeps dissy-dissing me. I envy that buddy-buddy of hers...${prompt}
  8519: Her buddy-buddy?${prompt}
  8520: Yeah. When they were still little kiddos, somebody told her that he liked her hairstyle--and she hasn't changed it since. I just want to talk to that square and ask him if he could convince Chululu here to let me work my magic on her.${prompt}
  8521: Runga-Kopunga! You were supposed to keep that a secretaru!${prompt}
  8522: |-
    Ha ha ha! Sorry, baby-baby!
    If you ever have second thoughts, I'll be waiting!${prompt}
  8523: Y-you see! I wasn't going anywhere!${prompt}
  8524: A ha ha... You weren't going anywhere...ha ha...${prompt}
  8525: But what you said before... You lov...${prompt}
  8526: |-
    Oh, yeah, yeah.
    That was just a joke. You get it? Ha ha ha. Pretty funny, rightaru?${prompt}
  8527: |-
    Hmph! I knew it was a joke. What do you think I am, stupid?
    Well, it wasn't very funny-bunny, but you never did have a sense of humor, now did you?${prompt}
  8528: |-
    Well, excu～se me!
    By the way, who was that buddy-buddy that hair-boy was talking aboutaru?${prompt}
  8529: Well, we know it wasn't you! And why should I tell you, anyway?${prompt}
  8530: Wasn't me? Well then, that narrows down the list. The last time I checked, there weren't many people you could call buddy-buddy!${prompt}
  8531: |-
    Hmmm...
    So, do you think she understood how I feel?${prompt}
  8532: |-
    How did he do?

    Great!
    Terrible!${prompt}

    Really-willy?
    Yeah, I'm what they call a “smooth operator.”${prompt}
  8534: |-
    Terrible, huh?
    But I don't think I could pull off something like that again. Just the thought of it turns my face all reddy-weddy with embarrassment!${prompt}
  8535: However, as long as Chululu is working here beside me, I'm as happy as a happy Taru can be!${prompt}
  8536: Now, don'taru you go telling Chululu I said that!${prompt}
  8537: |-
    <Sigh>
    Boy, was I surprised when he told me he...
    But he's always like that. Why can't he just be a little more in touch with his feelings?${prompt}
  8538: But to tell you the truth, I was pretty happy-wappy when he finally let the beans outaru of the baggie! But don'taru you go telling Kurou-Morou I said that!${prompt}

    What were you supposed to do? What was I supposed to do?
    The only person I could trust--hell, the only person I knew on the mainland--was Grezzo.${prompt}

  8632: But now he's gone and...${prompt}
  8633: Oh well, you'll still get us a boat so we can go home, right?${prompt}

    I don't know. I'm not in the business of asking questions, young lady. As long as I get paid, I could care less what he does over there.
    And I don't care if you tag along, but that's not for me to decide. You'll have to get the customer's permission.${prompt}
  8639: Oh well. As much as I was looking forward to a private cruise, I guess I can't complain.${prompt}
  8640: How thoughtful...${prompt}
  8641: And you, ${name-player}. Why don't you go back to Tavnazia as well? You could lay low there for a while until Wolfgang's cooled off.${prompt}

    Very well. It will take some time to prepare the ship. I will send a messenger when everything is ready. Until then, why don't you take a look around the city?${prompt}

  8645: Alright! Now it's time to have some fun!${prompt}
  8646: See ya, ${name-player}! Maybe we can get together again sometime...if you're still alive!${prompt}
  8647: Well, it looks like you should probably turn yourself in. This may be the only chance to try and prove your innocence.${prompt}
  8648: It looks like you should probably turn yourself in, ${name-player}. This may be the only chance to try and prove your innocence.${prompt}
  8649: ${name-player}, you weren't thinking of running now, were you? If you know what's good for you, you'll head on up to the Grand Duke Palace and face your crimes.${prompt}

    I see...
    You wish to know more of the magicite gem that a peddler from Tavnazia sold to Bastok over thirty years ago...${prompt}
  8655: I do recall hearing stories of the “Star of Tavnazia”; unfortunately, I never actually set my eyes upon it. I do not know what it is, or if the magicite was a piece of it.${prompt}

    Magicite...
    The Star of Tavnazia...${prompt}
  8657: |-
    ?
    Sir Aldo? You would not happen to know anything of the gem, would you?${prompt}
  8658: I've heard stories of a mysterious gem kept in the Tavnazian Cathedral. If that relic is also magicite, I wonder in what way it's connected with the other magicite found around Vana'diel...${prompt}
  8659: Deep within the Orc, Quadav, and Yagudo strongholds, there are doors that the beastmen guard with their lives. Beyond those doors lie giant crystals emitting a strange, eerie light.${prompt}
  8660: If the beastmen were drawn to these crystals and chose those areas to build their towns, then the magicite in the Northlands is more than likely... Hmmm...${prompt}
  8661: Perhaps someone in Tavnazia knows something. However, we cannot leave without Prishe. Oh, where could she have wandered off to?${prompt}
  8662: |-
    Leader!
    That girl! She's been taken to Doctor Monberaux's!${prompt}

  8666: Prishe!
  8667: |-
    They say some Elvaan girl was attacked while in the Temple of the Goddess--right in front of the statue of Altana!
    What is this city coming to!?${prompt}
  8668: |-
    Huh? You think it was a Tenshodo member that did the dirty deed!?
    ${name-player}, you'd better watch your tongue unless you want to see it on a plate!${prompt}
  8669: That blue-haired girl was taken to Monberaux's after the attack. I'm pretty sure she'll be all right, though. Doctor M. is the best medic in town.${prompt}
  8670: You don't need to worry, ${name-player}. Our city's fine doctor is taking care of Prishe as we speak.${prompt}
  8671: And as for the fiends that would do something like this, I guarantee you my men and women will find them.${prompt}
  8672: If you're looking for Prishe, she and that rich boy Tenzen have already set sail for the Tavnazian Archipelago. You're following them, right?${prompt}
  8673: Sir, the airships are ready for departure.${prompt}
  8674: I will be traveling on a separate vessel. If “he” appears before I arrive, prevent him from escaping, but do not attack.${prompt}
  8675: Yes, sir!${prompt}
  8676: It is all working as planned. Now, I will finally retrieve what is mine.${prompt}
  8677: |-
    Hey there, pal.
    I just met the weirdest Elvaan kid.${prompt}
  8678: She didn't have a single gil on her, but she spent hours in the gem store mooning over the same piece of jewelry.${prompt}
  8679: Eventually, the beauties working behind the counter got tired of her antics and threw her out.${prompt}
  8680: I'd been watching the whole thing and had the rotten luck of meeting the girl's eyes when she left the store.${prompt}
  8681: She's been dogging me ever since.${prompt}
  8682: I don't know if it was female intuition or what, but somehow she figured out I have a thing for the three ladies in the gem store.${prompt}
  8683: |-
    ...
    So, which one's my favorite out of the three?${prompt}
  8684: At first I thought the classical beauty on the left was my type.${prompt}
  8685: But then I got to thinking older women are the way to go, like the lady on the right.${prompt}
  8686: |-
    And then, not long ago, the pure and innocent type in the middle actually said hello to me.
    Now I'm captivated by her charms.${prompt}
  8687: To be perfectly honest with you, any of those three ladies could make me a happy man.${prompt}
  8688: My plan is to confess my feelings to the one who likes me the most--the one least likely to turn me down.${prompt}
  8689: |-
    When I explained all this to the Elvaan girl, she almost split her sides in laughter.
    The little brat!${prompt}
  8690: 'She told me that if I talked to each of the ladies in turn while holding ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, I would know which of them had feelings for me.${prompt}'
  8691: 'But I''ve never even heard of ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, let alone seen one.${prompt}'
  8692: Even an adventurer like you wouldn't have a clue where to get a gem like that, would you?${prompt}
  8693: |-
    Any clue about ${item-plural: 1[2]}?
    ${selection-lines}
    I have a pretty good idea.
    Never heard of them.${prompt}
  8694: |-
    No clue, right?
    I think that kid's just stringing me along for a laugh.${prompt}
  8695: |-
    You serious?
    Are you sure you're not just making fun of my feelings, like that Elvaan kid?${prompt}
  8696: |-
    Grrr!
    Just thinking about the smirk on that brat's face...${prompt}
  8697: 'Could I really find out which of those beauties had feelings for me if I had ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}?${prompt}'
  8698: "Nah, things are never that easy. \nThat Elvaan brat is just making fun of me.${prompt}"
  8699: 'Is that really...${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!?${prompt}'
  8700: |-
    I can't believe that kid was telling the truth.
    Well, I'll be damned.${prompt}
  8701: |-
    There's no time to lose.
    I gotta get in there and find the girl of my dreams!${prompt}
  8702: |-
    You ready?
    I'm going in!${prompt}
  8703: I'm looking to buy a necklace...${prompt}
  8704: |-
    Of course, sir!
    Is it a gift for someone special?${prompt}
  8705: Um, yeah...could be...${prompt}
  8706: We have a great selection for you to choose from! Just a moment, sir!${prompt}
  8707: Man, my hands won't stop sweating.${prompt}
  8708: 'So how''s this ${item-singular: 1[2]} supposed to work?${prompt}'
  8709: |-
    Whoa!
    The ${item-singular: 1[2]} changed color!
    Is this what she meant!?${prompt}
  8710: 'This ${item-singular: 1[2]} is one fantastic gem!${prompt}'
  8711: You wandered off before things got interesting, but you shoulda seen the sparks of romance fly between me and Adelflete.${prompt}
  8712: My mind is made up!${prompt}
  8713: |-
    It's more than just knowing that she likes me.
    Now I realize just how much I liked her!${prompt}
  8714: You say you've seen it all before?${prompt}
  8715: |-
    Hahaha!
    Looks like someone has a small case of jealousy.${prompt}
  8716: Well, here's a little present from the happiest man in the world to help cheer you up.${prompt}
  8717: |-
    Hahaha!
    Don't look so glum. The world's full of possibilities, even for you!${prompt}
  8718: |-
    Hahaha!
    I'm sorry, but one look at your face tells the whole story.
    Seeing me with my new girl reminds you of how unlucky you are, right?${prompt}
  8719: |-
    Don't worry, pal! The world's full of possibilities!
    Hahaha!${prompt}
  8720: The customer Adelflete just served--isn't he the man who's always loitering outside the store?${prompt}
  8721: |-
    Did you happen to see the gem he was holding?
    It's a rare stone that changes color depending on the temperature.${prompt}
  8722: |-
    Ah yes, I've seen one before.
    When the person holding it becomes hot and flustered, the hue of the gem changes.${prompt}
  8723: I've heard that it's used in other countries to measure the intensity of a person's feelings.${prompt}
  8724: Which would mean that he's quite taken by our Adelflete, wouldn't it?${prompt}
  8725: |-
    I was wondering who he was after for quite a while now.
    Now we know.${prompt}
  8726: |-
    I can't wait to see what happens.
    It's just like having one of those romantic plays right inside the store!${prompt}
  8727: |-
    What, you want to explore the towers of Pso'Xja?
    That shouldn't be a problem. We recently opened those ruins to all explorers.${prompt}
  8728: However, the Tenshodo is currently conducting an investigation on the deeper areas of the central tower, and we can't have pesky adventurers running around getting in our way.${prompt}
  8729: Though...if you were to scratch our backs, we wouldn't have any problems scratching yours.${prompt}
  8730: It just happens that the Tenshodo is searching for a certain jewel that is very popular in the Near Eastern countries.${prompt}
  8731: What kind of gem is it? Hmmm... Well, they're thin, hexagonally shaped, and come in rare colors like carmine and cyan. I heard that rich people like to decorate their turbans with them.${prompt}
  8732: They even say that sometimes a strange light shoots from their centers, though I've never seen it happen.${prompt}
  8733: Luckily for you, we've been finding a lot of those jewels in the other towers of Pso'Xja.${prompt}
  8734: Unfortunately, some strange device in that place seems to weaken even the strongest of our members. That's where you come in.${prompt}
  8735: Now, if you were to find one of those and bring it back to me, I'm pretty sure I could convince the boss to allow you access to the central tower.${prompt}
  8736: If you want to have access to the deeper parts of Pso'Xja, bring me a jewel from the ruins and I'll see what I can do.${prompt}
  8737: |-
    Hmmm...
    This looks a lot like what we're dealing in, but the color just isn't right. We want something a little more “exotic” than the regular colored gems.${prompt}
  8738: |-
    Well, what do you know?
    This is exactly what we've been looking for.${prompt}
  8739: You know, you're not a bad treasure hunter. Did you ever think of joining the Tenshodo?${prompt}
  8740: |-
    Ah, but you'd probably get bored really quick.
    Anyway, take this pass. It will give you access to the more “sensitive” areas of the ruins.${prompt}
  8741: But I'll warn you one last time--the central tower ruins are still under investigation.${prompt}
  8742: Don't expect any search parties if you happen to get lost.${prompt}
  8743: |-
    Welcome to Neptune's Spire!
    Hm? Oh, I remember you. You're the one that brought us that gem from Pso'Xja.
    After you brought it in, we learned that... Wait, how do I know I can trust you?${prompt}
  8744: |-
    Can you keep a secret?
    ${selection-lines}
    My lips are sealed.
    I can't guarantee anything.${prompt}
  8745: |-
    Then the Tenshodo can't trust you with this info.
    See you around, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady].${prompt}
  8746: |-
    Welcome to Neptune's...
    Ah, look who's back. Did you find some glue for your loose lips?${prompt}
  8747: |-
    If I find out you told anyone about this, I'll... Well, you know what we'll do to you.
    Anyway, about those Pso'Xja gems...${prompt}
  8748: Well, it looks like those jewels aren't just any rocks that fell out of some hole in a mountain.${prompt}
  8749: 'Thanks to adventurers like you, we''ve learned that there are three types: gray, cyan, and carmine--and they all harbor some kind of strange energy that''s not found anywhere else on Vana''diel.${prompt}'
  8750: Also, we've recently received reports from our colleagues in Bastok that the chief Republican engineer, Cid, has been collecting the gems.${prompt}
  8751: Now, if we can find out what power those chips truly hold, the Tenshodo could make a killing!${prompt}
  8752: Oh, and of course you'll get your cut. You're not thinking we'd short-change you, are you?${prompt}
  8753: The IRNC has dispatched me to help support all those who wish to participate in Conflict.${prompt}

  8801: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  8802: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  8803: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  8804: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  8805: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  8806: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  8807: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  8808: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  8809: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  8810: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  8811: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  8812: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  8813: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  8814: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  8815: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  8816: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  8817: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  8818: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  8819: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  8820: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  8821: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  8822: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  8823: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'
  8824: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt}
  8825: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  8826: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  8827: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
  8828: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}
  8829: 'You find the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} hidden within the streetlamp and place it in the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}'

    You're not gonna use it anymore, right?
    I can tell.${prompt}

    I...I'm looking for the perfect place to cast my line.
    It takes time to find just the right spot.${prompt}
  8839: |-
    Uh-huh.
    But you've already found the perfect place.${prompt}
  8840: |-
    You just don't have the guts to go there.

    Just give me your damn rod.

  8855: Haven't you been listening to a thing I said about being naive?${prompt}
  8856: If you really believe her story, then you should prove it.${prompt}
  8857: If, as you say, the girl really lost the rod, then it must still be in the clutches of some monster in Qufim!${prompt}

    She was lying, right?
    Please help me find my precious ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt}

  8867: I am sorry, adventurer.${prompt}

  8870: But I couldn't understand why...${prompt}

    Tell me, adventurer.
    You're friends with that girl.${prompt}
  8874: |-
    You must be.

  8880: That girl went to Qufim in my stead...${prompt}
  8881: She went there to retrieve the pride I had lost in my favorite pastime.${prompt}
  8882: |-
    Thank you, adventurer.
    You helped me to realize this.

    But how could this be?
    Its power is meantaru to be sealed within a lake of ice--a place in the northeast of Beaucedine Glacier known as “Mirror Pond.”${prompt}

  9255: And that's why I want to continue our adventures together.${prompt}
  9256: Our partnership has been the greatest treasure I've ever found...${prompt}
  9257: I hope we can keep exploring the wonders of this world side by side, and improve our skills as adventurers.${prompt}

  9270: To tell the truth, I doubted the powers of the mirror at first.${prompt}
  9271: But after listening to Palometa's story, I was glad that I trusted in the Glass of All-Seeing.${prompt}
  9272: Looking back, these past events have been just the kind of excitement I needed.${prompt}
  9273: The mirror is a great treasure--that's for sure!${prompt}
  9274: But I value the friendship we've made even more!${prompt}
  9275: You hold on to that pearl, you hear me, ${name-player}!?${prompt}
  9276: I felt a strange power within the Glass of All-Seeing from the first moment I picked it up.${prompt}

  9278: Until finally I wasn't sure if it was the mirror giving off these waves, or something else entirely...${prompt}

  9290: When the bearer of the Mirror of Blighted Gloom meets the wielder of the Glass of Blessed Radiance, something huge is supposed to happen.${prompt}
  9291: The power I felt was a premonition of the brewing storm.${prompt}
  9292: Looking back, that story was almost prophetic.${prompt}
  9293: But it was thanks to you that we came through this storm unharmed.${prompt}

  9307: I wonder if the guiding power of the mirror was born from these people's thoughts.${prompt}
  9308: What could they possibly be trying to lead us to?${prompt}
  9309: In any event, the Glass of All-Seeing has taken me on an amazing journey.${prompt}

  9344: I just knew that a life-changing experience had been set in motion.${prompt}
  9345: Since arriving in Jeuno, I've met so many people and survived so many incidents, I'm starting to lose track.${prompt}
  9346: 'But there is one thing I''ll never forget: the time we first met.${prompt}'
  9347: You appeared before me at the Eldieme Necropolis, ${name-player}.${prompt}

    This might sound a little exaggerated, but never before had I felt destiny so keenly.

  9353: At first, I was only interested in the Glass of All-Seeing's beauty.${prompt}
  9354: But over time, the images it showed me became the focus of my journey.${prompt}
  9355: Following its guidance led me to you, Luto, and Palometa.${prompt}
  9356: I'm so glad Palometa was able to regain her father's mirror.${prompt}

  9370: |-
    I certainly hope so.
    And I hope Palometa will know peace in her life from now on.${prompt}

  9374: I know you'll never let me down.${prompt}

  9420: I couldn't believe it when we learned she was gonna be the guardian of her father's mirror.${prompt}

    He always gets like that when you're around.
    I don't get it, you don't look that special to me.
    It's starting to give me the heebie-jeebies...${prompt}
  9493: Being part of the Tenshodo means you'll sell your soul for the right amount of gil.${prompt}
  9494: Besides, taking risks is good for business, I always say.${prompt}
  9495: This time, we 'ave got quite a special customer, so we can't go prattling off about the details of their request to just anyone.${prompt}
  9496: Getting wind of such a thing could make our client a mite angry, and we certainly wouldn't want that.${prompt}
  9497: That's why I 'ave been mixing up the orders with random bits o' information and givin' out mere snippets at a time. Those o' you with sense should be able to put it all together, is what I think.${prompt}

  9506: O' course, me and the boss are on a whole different plane o' thinking.${prompt}
  9507: Still, the notion of “seeing the unseen” was one o' the main draws of the Tenshodo for me in the beginning. I've got high hopes for you...${prompt}

  9509: Ah, sorry. I left out the most important part, didn't I? Sorry t' leave you hanging there.${prompt}

  9515: Anyway, that's enough batting aroun' the bush for now. Let's dig straight in t' the juicy details, shall we?${prompt}
  9516: You know the ships at Mhaura used t' transport prospective mercenaries to the Near East? If you want t' climb aboard one o' those vessels, you 'ave got to go through none other than the Tenshodo here.${prompt}
  9517: We received a request from the Empire 'erself. Getting those ships t' port was a royal pain. We finally managed t' bargain a cheap price on some rickety old vessels, and...${prompt}
  9518: And you don't care. Sorry abou' that. A man's got to vent sometimes.${prompt}
  9519: Anyway, you should know by now how things work around 'ere. If you want something, you 'ave to bring me something I want, first.${prompt}
  9520: If you aren't in the mood t' scavenge up what I want, you can always cough up gil instead. O' course, that would be quickest.${prompt}
  9521: Let's make this explanation brief, shall we?${prompt}
  9522: You see, prices are a mite different in the Near East. Something that sells for a gil a dozen here might be a luxury item in Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  9523: |-
    Jumping straigh' to the point, now.
    I want you t' bring me some common items from this side o' Vana'diel, and I'll give you the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} in exchange.${prompt}
  9524: The more you bring me, the better. I 'ave put together a few lists if you'd like to take a look. I will leave it t' you which to bring me.${prompt}

    Ah yes, and there is gil, too. Righto.
    You can buy your way out if you choose.${prompt}

    ${selection-lines}
    Beginner list.
    Intermediate list.

  9530: Heh heh heh...${prompt}
  9531: |-
    The advanced list, eh? A superb choice. The items on this list are few, so they should fit nicely in your bag, but they are quite difficult t' come by.
    You can choose from the following:${prompt}
  9532: One coffer key from a beastman stronghold--Davoi, Beadeaux, Castle Oztroja, the Temple of Uggalepih, the Den of Rancor, the Quicksand Caves, or the Sea Serpent Grotto.${prompt}
  9533: A “testimony.” Those ancient scraps of papyrus seem t' be quite popular with collectors these days. I don't know all the details, but apparently there's a testimony for any o' the jobs an adventurer can be. Anyway, I just need one.${prompt}
  9534: Your last option is t' bring me chips from Pso'Xja.${prompt}
  9535: 'I''ll need a set o'' those, though. You''ll ''ave to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, all three.${prompt}'
  9536: |-
    That's it for the advanced list.
    You can bring me any one o' the above requests, but if you decide t' bring Pso'Xja chips, I'll need 'em in a set o' three.${prompt}
  9537: |-
    Intermediate, eh?
    This one is quite a bother.${prompt}
  9538: Beastmen 'ave been a real plague t' the Near East as of late. Not that we haven't been having problems here, too.${prompt}
  9539: But anyway, the situation 'as driven up the demand for beastman spoils.${prompt}
  9540: 'I want you t'' bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  9541: The beastmen have been using those t' relay orders. I require all three.${prompt}
  9542: |-
    That's all for the intermediate list.
    It may sound simple, but those items are scattered all about the strongholds and are rather difficult t' get a hold of.${prompt}
  9543: You say you want t' go to Aht Urhgan, but you're too big o' a coward to face a challenge, eh? That attitude will get you nowhere in the Empire, I tell you. Ah well, it's all the same t' me, as long as I make a profit.${prompt}
  9544: This will be more like running errands, but there are a lot o' things for you to collect on this list.${prompt}
  9545: 'There are a lot o'' curious items here. I need you to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt}'

    Hoho!
    So this high and mighty adventurer refuses t' be reduced to running errands!${prompt}
  9548: |-
    Ah, sorry abou' that.${wait-36: 1}
    I'm not picking on you, so don't get your feathers in a ruffle.${prompt}
  9549: 'So you are going t'' pay me ${number: 0} gil. Is that correct?${prompt}'

    Ah, it's you again.
    Did you make it t' Aht Urhgan in one piece? Sorry for catching you by surprise earlier.${prompt}
  9572: I'm not sure if you know this or not, but Aht Urhgan has a pact forbidding airships from flying over their nation.${prompt}
  9573: O' course, we found a way around that, and dropped you into that ginormous forest from the sky. The Tenshodo'll always give you your money's worth.${prompt}

  9597: Venture roll is a competitive game played with dice similar to those used by corsairs. The objective is to roll until your cumulative total comes as close to 11 as possible without going over.${prompt}
  9598: 'Until you reach or go over 11, you may continue rolling (${color: 5}doubling up${color: 1}) as many times as the table time limit allows (${number: 8} ${choice-plurality: 8}[minute/minutes], Earth time).${prompt}'

  9600: If your total ever goes over 11, you will automatically lose the game, regardless of the totals of other players. Knowing the right time to hold fast is one of the keys to staying in the match.${prompt}
  9601: Once all the players have held fast, the game is over and the results are announced. The player closest to 11 is declared the winner and receives all the gil in the pot (the original participation fees of all the players).${prompt}

    Moblin Maze Mongers is the revolutionary new business venture that's taking Vana'diel by storm!
    Making ingenious use of previously neglected caverns beneath Mindartia and Quon, our expert staff will create the perfect dungeon for you and your fellow adventurers!${prompt}
  9789: Use one of our state-of-the-art “Maze Tabulae” to lay out the guidelines, and sit back as our craftsmen dig and delve to your demanding specifications!${prompt}
  9790: Your maze will also be populated with a plethora of foul fiends and all manner of devious devices, all of which can also be customized to your liking!${prompt}
  9791: |-
    The maze you design may be a relaxed jaunt for the novice adventurer, or it may be a diabolical demesne that will challenge even the most battle-hardened adventurers.
    With control over almost every aspect of your creation, the choice is yours!${prompt}
  9792: |-
    So what are you waiting for?
    Let Moblin Maze Mongers build you the maze of your dreams--or nightmares--today!${prompt}
  9793: |-
    Moblin Maze Mongers makes designing your own dungeon quick and painless!
    With three simple-to-use items--“Maze Tabulae,” “Maze Vouchers,” and “Maze Runes”--you'll be a mazebuilding master in no time.${prompt}
  9794: The first and most important of these items is the “Maze Tabula,” which stores the layout and content of your maze. By using other items in conjunction with the Maze Tabula, you can customize various elements of your dungeon.${prompt}
  9795: Next you have the “Maze Voucher,” a construction order that specifies the objectives that must be met to successfully complete your maze.${prompt}
  9796: |-
    After receiving your Maze Voucher, we will proceed to build a maze according to your specifications.
    However, the Maze Voucher only dictates the final objectives for your dungeon--other details may be left to the whims of our craftsmen.${prompt}
  9797: |-
    You'd rather customize the nitty-gritty details yourself, you say? Fear not!
    That's where “Maze Runes” come in.
    The use of Maze Runes is completely optional, and is intended for detail-oriented adventurers who want more direct control over their creation.${prompt}
  9798: |-
    Be aware, however, that certain combinations of Maze Runes and Maze Vouchers are incompatible with each other, while others might produce unintended effects.
    Still, the possibilities are nearly limitless, so clients are encouraged to experiment!${prompt}
  9799: You may notice that certain Maze Tabulae contain blackened squares, or squares containing elemental symbols.${prompt}
  9800: |-
    Black squares indicate squares that cannot hold Maze Runes.
    Please manipulate your Maze Runes as necessary so that they do not touch any black squares.${prompt}
  9801: |-
    Elemental squares will enhance the effect of any Maze Runes they come in contact with.
    Such Maze Runes will exert a far greater influence on your maze than under typical circumstances.${prompt}
  9802: |-
    The concept of elemental opposition does not apply to the Maze Tabula.
    Provided that at least one compatible element exists, the Maze Rune in question will see its effect augmented.${prompt}
  9803: After customizing your dungeon with the three items described above, please trade your completed Maze Tabula to the Maze Monger Shopfront.${prompt}
  9804: Once your Maze Tabula is confirmed and you've paid the necessary excavation and construction fee, you and your companions will be escorted posthaste to your brand-spanking new, custom-built maze!${prompt}
  9805: 'Customers should know that due to high demand for the Maze Mongers'' services, only one maze order can be accepted from any single adventurer per ${choice: 0}[twenty hours/one hour] (Earth time).${prompt}'
  9806: |-
    However, there are no restrictions placed on using mazes created by other adventurers.
    Adventurers who would like to take on multiple mazes a day are strongly encouraged to cooperate with their friends.${prompt}
  9807: This section will explain the procedure for adventuring in your custom-built maze from start to finish, entrance to exit!${prompt}
  9808: |-
    After your order has been accepted and paid for, you and your companions will be escorted to the maze lobby.
    Please wait here patiently until the construction process is completed.${prompt}
  9809: |-
    During this time, our lead foreman Packapic will provide you with a brief overview of the facilities.
    You will also be given the opportunity to purchase maze-specific items should you so desire.${prompt}
  9810: |-
    After construction has completed, our gatekeeper and guide Rediroq will lead you and your companions into the maze.
    The challenge begins!${prompt}
  9811: "Should you manage to successfully complete the conditions specified on the Maze Voucher, a treasure chest will appear somewhere within the maze. \nWhat myriad riches may lie inside? You'll just have to see for yourself!${prompt}"
  9812: |-
    After successfully retrieving your reward, you are free to exit the maze.
    You may do so by any one of the following methods:${prompt}
  9813: "”Leaving From the Exit”\nEach maze will contain an exit door with a Maze Monger attendant posted in the vicinity. \nIf spoken to, this attendant will lead all participants out of the maze.${prompt}"
  9814: Located near the exit is a beacon. Attendants have been instructed to trigger this as soon as the maze objectives have been successfully met, so you may use it as a guide in the event that you are unsure of your progress.${prompt}
  9815: |-
    “Using a ${item-singular: 0[2]}”
    A complimentary ${item-singular: 0[2]} will be presented to you free of charge before you enter the maze.
    Using this will cause the adventurer who used it--and that person alone--to be transported out of the maze.${prompt}
  9816: |-
    “Emergency Extraction”
    Should unforeseen circumstances occur that are deemed to present an imminent danger to maze participants, Moblin Maze Mongers staff reserve the right to perform an emergency rescue operation to remove all participants from the maze.${prompt}
  9817: |-
    Now you have all the necessary knowledge to enjoy your custom maze!
    Happy spelunking!${prompt}
  9818: Clients should be aware of the following rules and regulations governing the use of Maze Monger mazes.${prompt}
  9819: Adventurers who flee from a given maze without completing the stated objectives will not be permitted to re-enter that same maze.${prompt}
  9820: |-
    Upon completing the objectives, a treasure chest is guaranteed to appear somewhere within the maze.
    Please do not forget to seek it out and claim your reward before exiting the dungeon.${prompt}
  9821: "Maze difficulty will, in principle, be tailored to the highest level adventurer in the event that a party contains adventurers of disparate skill levels. \nNote, however, that there may be exceptions to this depending on the objectives specified on your Maze Voucher.${prompt}"
  9822: |-
    We at Moblin Maze Mongers strongly encourage building and exploring mazes in parties.
    While we will not refuse solo clients, please be aware that completing the maze objectives alone may prove to be a difficult task.${prompt}
  9823: "Our expert craftsmen take the highest pride in the safety and stability of their work. \nPlease understand, however, that due to the inherent tectonic instability of subterranean caverns, we cannot rule out the possibility of collapses or cave-ins occurring over the course of time.${prompt}"
  9824: |-
    In such cases, we reserve the right to initiate emergency rescue operations that will instantly transport all clients outside the maze to safety.
    Moblin Maze Mongers will accept no responsibility for treasures left unclaimed as a result of such a rescue operation, so adventurers are encouraged--for their own benefit--to proceed through the maze in a timely fashion.${prompt}
  9825: In addition to the treasures to be gained within mazes, adventurers will also receive special tokens called “Moblin Marbles” as a reward for the successful completion of a maze.${prompt}
  9826: These Moblin Marbles can be exchanged at the Maze Mongers office for a wide variety of exciting, exclusive goods and prizes!${prompt}
  9827: How about a nice, shiny one of these?${prompt}
  9828: Or a spiffy, sparkling one of these?${prompt}
  9829: Rack up enough Moblin Marbles, and there's a veritable cornucopia of prizes to be had!${prompt}
  9830: |-
    And that's not all--Moblin Marbles can also be used to purchase other benefits!
    These include the ability to register your completed Maze Tabulae and share your creations with adventurers far and wide, or an assortment of official designations.${prompt}
  9831: Accumulate as many as you can and make the most of your maze-mongering experience!${prompt}
  9832: |-
    There's only one copy, so don't ye go carryin' it off now.

  9833: |-
    Hmmmm...so ye want t'order a maze, do ye?${wait-36: 1}
    Sorry, but our mazes aren't fer you greenhorn types.
    Come back when ye've seen more of the world, why don't ye?${prompt}
  9834: |-
    Thanks to the loyal patronage of adventurers like you, business is positively booming here at Moblin Maze Mongers!
    We've been so successful, in fact, that unscrupulous rival corporations have sprung up trying to cash in on our profits!${prompt}
  9835: |-
    With great success, though, comes great responsibility!
    Here at Moblin Maze Mongers, we are dedicated to preserving the pristine subterranean environment that makes our unique service possible.
    Regrettably, this means there are times when we must temporarily close our mazes for necessary maintenance.${prompt}
  9836: |-
    At the same time, Moblin Maze Mongers always puts you, the customer, first!
    How can we reward our loyal customers for their part in keeping our caves clean and tectonically sound?
    Here's how: with our all-new Cave Conservation (C.C.) point system!${prompt}
  9837: "Customers will receive their first C.C. point ${choice: 0}[thirty-two hours/one hour and twenty minutes] (Earth time) after exiting a maze they have created, with another point being added every ${choice: 0}[eight hours/twenty minutes] (Earth time) thereafter. \nA maximum of six points may be accumulated at any one time.${prompt}"
  9838: |-
    And what will C.C. points earn you? More loot, that's what!
    Ordering a maze with C.C. points in your possession will result in the appearance of an additional, bonus treasure chest upon completion of your objectives! The contents will vary based upon your Maze Voucher, with greater riches awaiting you for each C.C. point you've accumulated.${prompt}
  9839: |-
    Please be aware that your C.C. points will be reset to zero upon ordering a new maze.
    Any treasure that goes unclaimed will revert to the property of Moblin Maze Mongers. No returns, no refunds.${prompt}

  9920: Now, before-ethy I proceed, please be reminded that not a single word spoken here today must be allowed to leave-ethy this room.${prompt}
  9921: If what my investigation has revealed is true-ethy, we have a major crisis looming.${prompt}
  9922: A teleportation mishap-ethy has resulted in the creation of a clone-ethy of Doctor Shantotto!${prompt}
  9923: Wh-what? As if one Doctor Shantotto wasn't already a handful, now we have to contend with two!?${prompt}
  9924: Of all the Goddess-forsaken incidents...${prompt}
  9925: And to rub-ethy salt into the wound, the evil tendencies exhibited by the newly created clone are such-ethy that they put the original doctor to shame-ethy!${prompt}
  9926: |-
    “Domina Shantotto,” she has taken-ethy to calling herself, though this you may already know-ethy.
    Ever since her appearance-ethy, she hasn't wasted a second to enact her malicious machinations!${prompt}
  9927: Oh, my poor, tired head-ethy...${prompt}

    If word-ethy gets out to the other nations, Windurst will become the laughingstock-ethy of the two continents!

    Had only I heeded Principal Koru-Moru's warnings...
    Oh, the Goddess strike-ethy me down for a fool!${prompt}
  9930: To avoid raising alarm bells, we've planted a life-size talking doll-ethy of the doctor at her abode and imbued it with a personality that's equally abrasive-ethy, but the people won't be fooled for long.${prompt}
  9931: We must act, and act fast-ethy, lest all of this becomes public knowledge and mass panic-ethy grips the land!${prompt}
  9932: Certainly not the kind of predicament you want to get dragged into should you wish to live to a ripe old age...
  9933: But as much as I'm loath to admit it, we--myself and all adventurers included--are already involved up to our necks.${prompt}
  9934: Whatever devious scheme that Domina Shantotto is plotting, it would be naive to assume that she has any less than the whole of Vana'diel in her sights.${prompt}
  9935: Now, I think it's safe to say that we're all agreed that action must be taken.${prompt}
  9936: But what should our first step be to avert this clear and present danger?${prompt}
  9937: Let me first tell-ethy you what else I know.${prompt}
  9938: Upon learning of the teleportation mishap-ethy, I sought to locate the whereabouts of the original-ethy Doctor Shantotto. I deduced that the clone-ethy might have had a hand in her disappearance.${prompt}
  9939: And sure-ethy enough, my sources have revealed that the original doctor is being held captive-ethy somewhere in Ro'Maeve.${prompt}
  9940: I propose-ethy that our first act is the rescue of “Original Shantotto”--for the sake of convenience, let's call-ethy her by this moniker for the time being.${prompt}
  9941: 'Ah, I see where you''re going with this: fight fire with fire!${prompt}'
  9942: It sounds like our best bet. The odds would be greatly improved if we had the original Shantotto fighting on our side.${prompt}
  9943: ${name-player}, I trust I can rely on your full cooperation in this.${prompt}
  9944: Let's be on our way!${prompt}
  9945: I trust I can rely on your full cooperation in rescuing the original Doctor Shantotto.${prompt}
  9946: According to Professor Yoran-Oran, the doctor is being held captive in Ro'Maeve.${prompt}
  9947: “A perfect world order...${prompt}
  9948: '...that exists solely for our pleasure”!?${prompt}'
  9949: Does that witch's derangement know no bounds!?${prompt}
  9950: |-
    <Puff...wheeze...>
    Th-the doctor's location-ethy! I have it!${prompt}
  9951: As a last resort, I employed the services of Windurst's infamous Cat Burglar-ethy, Nanaa Mihgo, to locate Doctor Shantotto.${prompt}
  9952: 'And true-ethy to her reputation, she''s successfully tracked down the doctor''s current hideout-ethy: the Sacrificial Chamber within the Temple of Uggalepih!${prompt}'
  9953: The only hitch-ethy is--and acquiring this piece of information further lightened my coin purse-ethy--ancient artifacts known as “Tablets of Hexes” are required for entry. They can supposedly be found-ethy scattered throughout the temple and deeper within.${prompt}
  9954: Ah, yes. The Cat Burglar has never been one to lose scent of her prey.${prompt}
  9955: So the next leg of our journey takes us to Elshimo Island...${prompt}
  9956: By means fair or foul, we must put an end to Shantotto's nefarious plot.${prompt}
  9957: Vana'diel must not be allowed to fall into such tyrannical hands!${prompt}
  9958: |-

    Greetings, friend! I am a synergy engineer, dispatched from the Institute to maintain the furnaces you see beside me.

  10029: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt}
  10030: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  10031: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt}
  10032: |-
    Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.
    If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt}
  10033: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  10034: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  10035: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  10036: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  10037: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  10038: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  10039: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  10040: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  10041: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  10042: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  10043: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10044: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  10045: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  10046: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  10047: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  10048: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  10049: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  10050: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  10051: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  10052: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10053: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  10054: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  10055: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  10056: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  10057: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  10058: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  10059: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  10060: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  10061: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}

    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  10063: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  10064: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  10065: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  10066: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  10067: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  10068: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  10069: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  10070: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  10071: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  10072: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  10073: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  10074: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  10075: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  10076: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  10077: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  10078: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10079: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  10080: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  10081: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  10082: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  10083: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  10084: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  10085: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  10086: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  10087: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  10088: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  10089: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  10090: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  10091: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  10092: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  10093: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  10094: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  10095: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  10096: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  10097: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  10098: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  10099: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  10100: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  10101: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  10102: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  10103: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  10104: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  10105: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  10106: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  10107: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  10108: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  10109: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  10110: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  10111: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  10112: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?
    Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  10113: |-
    A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know.

    Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one!
    Ain't synergy grand?${prompt}

    I thought you'd never ask!
    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  10133: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  10134: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'
  10135: |-
    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  10136: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  10137: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  10138: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  10139: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  10140: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  10141: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}
  10142: |-
    That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.
    Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt}

  10256: I wish you the best of luck in this endeavor.${prompt}
  10257: The government of Jeuno has promulgated a system for adventurers to pioneer uncharted lands.${prompt}
  10258: This system was proposed by the leaders of the Sacred City of Adoulin, an overseas trading capital whose volume of trade rivals Jeuno's.${prompt}
  10259: Pioneers are to traverse the waters of the Sea of Zafmlug, far to the west, and assist in colonizing the untamed wilds of Ulbuka.${prompt}
  10260: Once word of this proposal reached San d'Oria through various trade routes, it introduced Jeuno to the idea, which led to its eventual implementation.${prompt}
  10261: Adoulin is not a place for the weak or uninitiated. Harsh wildlands surround the city, and simple layfolk stand no chance of surviving. It is due to these unique circumstances that Adoulin has begun recruiting highly seasoned adventurers to assist in seeing out its goals.${prompt}
  10262: Here at the Consultation Desk, we issue permits that allow proactive adventurers to cross over to Adoulin.${prompt}
  10263: However, neophytes cannot provide the services Adoulin requires. As such, the Chamber has commissioned a simple test for those seeking to make the perilous journey.${prompt}
  10264: Those seasoned in battle should find it to be a relatively painless affair.${prompt}
  10265: 'Adoulin has prepared a multitude of ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}, of which one will be given to each adventurer seeking to prove their worth.${prompt}'
  10266: 'These ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} are attuned to the land, and are able to record markings located in specific locations. Further details will be provided once we have issued you the appropriate certifications.${prompt}'

  10269: 'You must simply pass the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} over the markings located in the area to finish your assignment.${prompt}'
  10270: 'Once you have completed this task, simply return the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to us here and we will analyze the results.${prompt}'
  10271: 'Should your trial be completed appropriately, you will be deemed to have passed, and will be issued ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, enabling you to travel to Adoulin.${prompt}'
  10272: That should constitute a sufficient explanation. Should you choose to undertake the test, I wish you the greatest of fortunes.${prompt}
  10273: As you may remember, the test requires you to visit one of several different dungeons.${prompt}
  10274: To be quite frank, we have received a large number of signatures from the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network. Evidently, what with all the adventurers coming and going, they need some help with non-battle activities as well.${prompt}
  10275: 'Given that, the committee deliberated day and night to come up with a solution. As a result of this grueling debacle, an executive decision was made to issue special tickets for the price of ${number: 1} gil.${prompt}'
  10276: The committee based its judgment on the idea that accumulating funds is yet another sign of a stalwart adventurer.${prompt}
  10277: After all, Adoulin is a city of maritime trade, just like our beloved Jeuno. We recognize that it welcomes business skill in all its forms, without regard to race or creed.${prompt}
  10278: 'As I have previously mentioned, issuing ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} will incur a fee of ${number: 1} gil.${prompt}'

  10290: Passing it over the surface of the portal will enable you to warp to Adoulin.${prompt}
  10291: Warping is not free, however; the process requires a certain type of energy.${prompt}
  10292: According to my materials, trading crystals to a waypoint will convert them into energy. This process is called “charging.”${prompt}
  10293: 'The energy, referred to as “kinetic units,” is recorded on the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} I have given you.${prompt}'
  10294: Utilizing the waypoints will deplete a portion of these kinetic units each time, so I recommend periodic recharging.${prompt}
  10295: It says here that all I have imparted to you may be reviewed at any time from any waypoint.${prompt}
  10296: Of course, in consideration of all your help, the one I have given you is fully charged. I hope that you put it to good use.${prompt}
  10297: That is all the information with which I can provide you. Your adventures in Adoulin will be what you make of them--and we have high hopes you will make a positive contribution to the development of the nation and the success of the pioneering initiative.${prompt}

    What do you want to ask about?
    ${selection-lines}
    The Strange Apparatus.
    The password.
    Tell me the password.
    Farewell.${prompt}
  10435: See you around.${prompt}
  10436: Huh? You mean you've never heard of a Strange Apparatus?${prompt}
  10437: 'They''re a type of mysterious device hidden in ${zone: 1[2]} as well as ${zone: 2[2]} and ${zone: 3[2]}, among other places.${prompt}'
  10438: Of course, I have no idea what such things are doing in caves, ruins, and the like.${prompt}
  10439: A password is necessary in order to grant you doctor status, which provides you with the necessary access privileges for the device.${prompt}
  10440: 'You can then place materials in the device to generate ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10441: Of course, you're not always guaranteed to get a weapon.${prompt}
  10442: Once you obtain the necessary access privileges, though, it boosts the chances a weapon will be synthesized, if only by a little bit.${prompt}
  10443: Huh? You want me to just give you the password I worked so hard to crack?${prompt}
  10444: That's a secret I risked my life against deadly elementals to learn.${prompt}
  10445: There's no way I could just tell you for free. Now, if we could agree on suitable compensation...${prompt}
  10446: Actually, you need MP to wield this weapon properly.${prompt}
  10447: For a Galkan warrior like myself, it's a constant struggle to keep up the necessary MP.${prompt}
  10448: 'So, if you can bring me ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, I suppose I could tell you the secret behind the password.${prompt}'
  10449: Very well. As promised, I'll tell you the secret behind the password.${prompt}
  10450: Okay, now listen carefully. The password consists of eight numbers in total, and you need to split it up into four sections of two digits each.${prompt}
  10451: First, you need to take the first three letters of your name and use them to generate a series of two-digit numbers based on their position in the alphabet.${prompt}
  10452: The letter A starts at “00,” B is “01,” and so on, until you reach Z at “25.”${prompt}
  10453: Furthermore, the area containing each device has been assigned an elemental, with each elemental given a numerical code.${prompt}
  10454: If the elemental is Fire, the number is “0,”, while Earth is “1,” until you reach Dark at “7.”${prompt}
  10455: Next, you need to take the value for the elemental and add it to each of your first three numbers. That will give you the first three values.${prompt}
  10456: For the fourth value, you need to add your first three values together and then add the elemental value as well.${prompt}
  10457: If the number exceeds 100, simply take the last two digits.${prompt}
  10458: Therefore, these four sets of numbers you calculated will become your eight-digit password.${prompt}
  10459: 'I suppose it''s still a bit difficult to comprehend. How about an example, then? Say you''re trying to register the password in ${zone: 1[2]}...${prompt}'
  10460: 'The first three letters of your name are ${entity: 0}, and the elemental for the device is ${choice: 6}[Fire/Earth/Water/Wind/Ice/Lightning/Light/Dark]...${prompt}'
  10461: 'Therefore, the numerical values for your name are ${number-alt: 0}, ${number-alt: 1}, and ${number-alt: 2}, and the elemental value is ${number: 3}.${prompt}'
  10462: 'That means the first three values are ${number-alt: 0}, ${number-alt: 1}, and ${number-alt: 2}.${prompt}'
  10463: 'The fourth value is created by adding the values for your name to that of the elemental for the area, which gives you ${number-alt: 3}.${prompt}'
  10464: 'The fourth value is created by adding the values for your name to that of the elemental for the area, which gives you ${number-alt: 4}. However, since it exceeds 100, the value becomes ${number-alt: 3}.${prompt}'
  10465: 'Putting all of these values together gives you ${number-alt: 0}${number-alt: 1}${number-alt: 2}${number-alt: 3}, which is your password to register your access privileges with the device.${prompt}'
  10466: Did you get all that?${prompt}
  10467: |-
    Got it?

  10469: As for what materials to place in the device, you'll need to research that for yourself.${prompt}

  10489: 'Apparently, the device in ${zone: 1[2]} just became operational recently.${prompt}'
  10490: Upon hearing the rumors, I went to check it out for myself...${prompt}
  10491: However, it asked me for a new password.${prompt}
  10492: I suppose it's requiring us to register for access privileges granted to those a rank above doctor status...${prompt}
  10493: I'm assuming that the values for the name are the same, and only the elemental value has changed, but I still haven't figured it out yet.${prompt}
  10494: If you manage to figure it out before I do, maybe you could give me a hint on how to crack the password.${prompt}
  10495: I'm sure it'll be fairly difficult, but I'd appreciate the help.${prompt}
  10496: Huh? Did you manage to figure out the new password!?${prompt}
  10497: I see... It looks like you beat me to it.${prompt}

  10500: I remember how I felt when I cracked the secret for the doctor-level password.${prompt}
  10501: It was tough, but the sheer joy I felt after it was over was worth it in the end.${prompt}
  10502: I would hate to have that sense of accomplishment taken away from me.${prompt}
  10503: If you could figure it out, I know I can too. Just you wait.${prompt}
  10504: Instead of the elemental value, I could take this... And then if I add that to the total...${prompt}

  10592: You're that adventurer who's not entirely-wirely unknown for ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] feats in Records of Eminence, right?${prompt}
  10593: If I recall correctaruly, your name is...${name-player}?${prompt}
  10594: |-
    Is that your name?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, ma'am.
    Nope, wrong person.
    My name's Kam'lanaut, jerk.${prompt}
  10595: Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't meant to holdy-wold you up. Carry on.${prompt}
  10596: What did you say? Sorry, I'm hardly fluentaru in stupid.${prompt}
  10597: I knew it, now here's the dossier of objective data. Make sure you don't look this giftaru chocobo in the mouth.${prompt}
  10598: What? You can't do this alone?${prompt}
  10599: Ugh, are you so mentaruly deficient that you haven't even heard of the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network?${prompt}
  10600: |-
    Lessee... A simple explanation for a simpleton...
    For example, you know those tomes that floataru outside the city, right?${prompt}
  10601: A.M.A.N. is the group responsible-wonsible for those and other such adventurer-supporting ideas.${prompt}
  10602: Records of Eminence is just another manifestation of A.M.A.N.'s helpful-welpful nature.${prompt}
  10603: I'd like to know exactaruly who's dispensing the spoils for completed objectives and why, however.${prompt}
  10604: They say that people's greatest fear is the fear of the unknown, which makes sense to me. Why else would my teeth start chattaruing every time I get objectives addressed to me with no sender?${prompt}
  10605: Anyway, that's why I'm so gracious-waciously giving this one to you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10606: '...You are going to prove to me that you''re a truly valiantaru and brave adventurer, aren''t you?${prompt}'
  10607: |-
    Will you prove your worth?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, for no one questions my valor!
    Doing your dirty work won't prove a thing.${prompt}
  10608: Fine, then. I'm sure there are hordes of other adventurers chomping-womping at the bit to prove their worth.${prompt}
  10609: |-
    I knew you'd be back.
    So, are you ready to prove-wove yourself in Records of Eminence?${prompt}
  10610: You adventurers can never abide affrontarus to your character, can you?${prompt}
  10611: Either way, your objective is to investigate various telepoints. Yeesh, this task is so far beneath a white mage of my caliber-waliber, it isn't even funny.${prompt}
  10612: |-
    Anything to say?
    ${selection-lines}
    It's not beneath me.
    Teleport me to them, then.${prompt}
  10613: |-
    Teleportaru you!?
    Bite me!${prompt}
  10614: You've just insulted every hardworking mage everywhere. You need to work for your share, not leech-weech off the kindness of strangers.${prompt}
  10615: |-
    Excellentaru.
    Just remember to procure gate crystals along the way, lest you look like a fool.${prompt}
  10616: |-
    Perfectaru.
    It shouldn't give you much trouble, either, as long as you know the spell Teleport.${prompt}
  10617: Alright, I'll see you once you've completarued your objective.${prompt}
  10618: Your mission, should you choose to remember-wember it, is to investigate the various telepoints scattered throughout Vana'diel.${prompt}
  10619: |-
    Fine, fine, fine. Let me listaru the ones you've been to:${choice: 0}[/ Holla.]${choice: 1}[/ Dem.]${choice: 2}[/ Mea.]${choice: 3}[/ Altepa.]${choice: 4}[/ Yhoator.]${choice: 5}[/ Vazhl.]
    I guess that means you've got ${choice: 6}[/one/two/three/four/five] to go.${prompt}
  10620: '...Not the ripest pamama in the bunch, I see. You haven''t investigated a single-wingle one!${prompt}'
  10621: I honestly didn't expectaru you to return with such haste.${prompt}
  10622: Oh...no...${prompt}
  10623: Don't you dare move a finger-winger, or I'll bite you harder than a poison leech!${prompt}
  10624: That was Ervie...I mean Ervok.${prompt}
  10625: He's my friend, but we haven't adventured together in so long. We've driftarued so far apart that the gap between us is impossible to cross.${prompt}
  10626: But now I hear he started teaching-weaching people about Records of Eminence!${prompt}
  10627: He even stopped using his real name. Now he goes by the moniker-woniker “Eternal Flame” or something dumb.${prompt}
  10628: Back in the old days, the five of us always used to venture forth into the unknown and combataru the forces of evil whenever we got the chance.${prompt}
  10629: I still remember how the auction house was always packed, so we'd meet in frontaru of the tavern.${prompt}
  10630: Beam me up, Toto!${prompt}
  10631: How many times have I told-wold you to stop calling me that!?${prompt}
  10632: I am constantly in your debt, Nantoto. Without your superb knowledge of the healing arts, I would never be able to effectively perform as a paladin.${prompt}
  10633: I agree! You've got more fighting spirit in your pinky toe than I have in my whole being!${prompt}
  10634: Wait, is fighting spirit really necessary when casting magic? I was under the impression that all you need...is love.${prompt}
  10635: Yeah, yeah, quit with the non sequitarus already. So, where do you want me to take you?${prompt}
  10636: Hmmm, where do I want to wrrreak havoc today...${prompt}
  10637: It's not that I hate the spell Teleport. On the contrary, I felt like I was serving a greater purpose-wurpose whenever I used it.${prompt}
  10638: I'll never forgetaru the memories of all I did with my friends back then. Countless sunsets have been swallowed by the ocean since I enjoyed using Teleport, but while I may not remember how many sunsets the seas have claimed, those memories are still as vivid as the bluest of skies.${prompt}
  10639: '...Although they may not mean much now that our friendship has darkened more than the setting sun.${prompt}'
  10640: |-
    C...can I confide something to you?
    ...There's another reason-weason I handed over that objective.${prompt}
  10641: You might not know this, but...one is the loneliest number to teleportaru.${prompt}
  10642: |-
    Ugh, forget I said anything!
    It was all an elaborataru lie! Don't listen to my misguided ramblings!${prompt}
  10643: More importantly, I should thank you for putting up with my shenanigan-wanigans.${prompt}
  10644: |-
    Here.
    Now get out of my sightaru!${prompt}
  10645: |-
    Ah, if it isn't ${name-player}.
    So, how's your inquestaru coming along?${prompt}
  10646: |-
    <Sniffle>
    I want to ask Rolandienne and the others a favor-wavor, but...${prompt}
  10647: '...What if they rejectaru my offer?${prompt}'
  10648: I just know they will, and I'll be devastatarued. Oh, my Goddess, I can feel myself getting depressed just thinking about it.${prompt}
  10649: <Sigh>...${prompt}
  10650: What timing-wiming you have, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  10651: Another one of those strange and horrible-worrible objectives showed up in my name!${prompt}
  10652: |-
    I don't getaru it at all.
    Why won't they leave me alone!?${prompt}
  10653: Moreover, it's a real doozy-woozy. How can a delicataru little flower like me possibly be asked to slay nasty shadows in the Eldieme Necropolis!?${prompt}
  10654: You know what? I refuse-wuse to undertake any of these until the person in charge shows himself!${prompt}
  10655: '...So, ${name-player}, my friend of friends. My buddy of buddies...how about acceptaruing this objective in my stead?${prompt}'
  10656: |-
    Anything to say?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'd love to help.
    ...Delicate little flower?
    No, thanks.${prompt}
  10657: |-
    Hmph!
    With that attitude, I'd be surprise-wised if you die ever having known the touch of a ${choice-player-gender}[woman/man].${prompt}
  10658: So, have you finally caved in and decided to eradicataru those shadows in the Eldieme Necropolis?${prompt}
  10659: Thanks for letting me know you're a misogynistaru.${choice-player-gender}[/ It must be such a burden to loathe your own kind.]${prompt}
  10660: Not scared of combat in the least, are you? Well, that's precisely the quality I'm looking for in my surrogataru.${prompt}
  10661: I give you permission to go completely berserk-werk over any opponent you find, so don't disappoint me.${prompt}
  10662: How does it feel to be the grim reaper-weaper of shadows in the Eldieme Necropolis?${prompt}
  10663: Don't be such a frrraidy cat, Toto. Come on, let's just go!${prompt}
  10664: When I say “No,” I explicitaruly mean no!${prompt}
  10665: Would a polite appeal from me, in addition to Fhelm, change your mind?${prompt}
  10666: Neither of you actually care about me. Ever since you began working as Records of Eminence guides, all you can think-wink about is how to make more gil!${prompt}
  10667: I can't completely deny that, because I do apprrreciate me some gil.${prompt}
  10668: How can you be so egocentric as to suppose that we spurned your company solely for the sake of profit? The real reason is that--${prompt}
  10669: Put a sock in it, Rrrolandienne!${prompt}
  10670: I apologize. I simply got carried away in the moment...${prompt}
  10671: |-
    Ah...
    H-hello, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10672: |-
    Anything to say?
    ${selection-lines}
    What's going on?
    Oooh, I love cat fights!${prompt}
  10673: I'm sorry you had to witness that unsavory-wavory display. It's just that...${prompt}
  10674: Sorry, but I'm not in the mood to play along with your japes today. To spare me the embarrassmentaru of you guessing what happened, let me tell you instead.${prompt}
  10675: These two just got done entreataruing me to help with an objective.${prompt}
  10676: That's the crrrux of the matter, at least.${prompt}
  10677: We believe that it is a tad difficult for us to carry out on our own, so we came to discuss the issue with Nantoto.${prompt}
  10678: |-
    But I'm not interested in rewards or spoils at all!
    And that's why you came to me... You knew you'd get half the pie for a third of the effortaru!${prompt}
  10679: Those catty rrremarks of yours couldn't be further from the truth. We're not trying to take advantage of you one bit.${prompt}
  10680: At any rate, we shall return when you are in a less ill humor.${prompt}
  10681: Cheerrrio, Toto!${prompt}
  10682: Haaah... I'm so drain-wained.${prompt}
  10683: At least I know you're not pretending-wending to be my friend to wring gil out of me, ${name-player}. I knew from the start you only cared about the reward.${prompt}
  10684: Yet I can't faultaru your work ethic. You've performed far better than I assumed you would.${prompt}
  10685: I have to say, though, part of me was jumping-wumping at the prospect of adventuring with my friends again.${prompt}
  10686: On the other hand, I no longer understand what motivatarus adventurers.${prompt}
  10687: I'd always assumed it was to appreciataru being with one's friends, but...${prompt}
  10688: What do you think? Is there a specific reason-weason you became an adventurer?${prompt}
  10689: |-
    What did you want to do as an adventurer?
    ${selection-lines}
    Explore unknown frontiers.
    Share experiences with friends.
    Stuff and things.
    Search for shiny equipment.
    Expand my intellectual horizons.
    Combat powerful entities.
    Nothing in particular.${prompt}
  10690: Well, at least you're honestaru. Straight answers can be so refreshing.${prompt}
  10691: |-
    You go “any way the wind blows,” eh?
    I envy-wenvy you. I could never bring myself to do something so radical.${prompt}
  10692: Unlike you, I...${prompt}
  10693: I simultaneously covetaru the adventurer lifestyle while withdrawing from it.${prompt}
  10694: What am I even doing...?${prompt}
  10695: Deep down, I understand that Records of Eminence, objectives, and adventuring are nothing more than impetus-wimpetuses.${prompt}
  10696: They're excuses to reach out, to make contactaru, to say, “I miss the time we spent together.”${prompt}
  10697: I just had to be stubborn-wubborn, though. If anyone here's a fool, it's definitely me.${prompt}
  10698: '...And now I''m complaining to you. Some embodimentaru of adventuring ideals I turned out to be.${prompt}'
  10699: Take this and leave me to wallow in my self-pity-wity already!${prompt}
  10700: Oh, to go adventuring again...${prompt}
  10701: |-
    Hey, I have an idea.
    Why not lightaru these fireworks from a place that has special meaning to you? A place that's overflowing with memories of the past.${prompt}
  10702: Then, could I ask you to share anything of significance-wificance you remember with those close to you?${prompt}
  10703: You don't have to...but if you do, I'd be in your debtaru.${prompt}
  10704: They say every adventurer has a reason for startaruing their journey. Sometimes I forget what mine was...${prompt}
  10705: ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10706: I've been giving it some thoughtaru for a while now, and, well, I...${prompt}
  10707: I quitaru being an adventurer!${prompt}
  10708: Now because of that...I need to ask you a favor-wavor.${prompt}
  10709: You see, I got a little bit of Eternal Flame in me and kind of had A.M.A.N. make a special-wecial objective for me.${prompt}
  10710: They were nice enough to oblige me and post it publicly, for all to undertake, which I appreciataru.${prompt}
  10711: After mulling-wulling it over, though, I realized that I can't possibly completaru it alone.${prompt}
  10712: |-
    So, yeeeah... <Whistle>
    I'm going to need-weed you to do it for me.${prompt}
  10713: |-
    Wh-what'll you have to do?
    Well, uhhhm...just excommunicataru some Yagudo High Priests from Castle Oztroja, that's all.${prompt}
  10714: Someone so teensy-weensy as me couldn't even pull a feather off one of them, let alone baste a flock. You've been baptized by the Records of Eminence, though! You can defeataru almost anything that comes at you, so will you please help me?${prompt}
  10715: |-
    Will you help her?
    ${selection-lines}
    With pleasure.
    If you give a Taru a treat...${prompt}
  10716: I guess I'll just have to ask a more competentaru adventurer, then. One who won't fly the coop when faced with a challenge.${prompt}
  10717: |-
    I just knew you would!
    Now, go out and ground a few of those high flyers in the name of progress-wogress!${prompt}
  10718: Why Yagudo High Priests?${prompt}
  10719: I have my reason-weasons...${prompt}
  10720: '...and that''s why it had to be those theocratic thugs. I was sick of that sour-wour taste in my mouth.${prompt}'
  10721: |-
    Anything to say?
    ${selection-lines}
    I feel for you.
    So you took it out on me?${prompt}
  10722: I can't begin to describe how elatarued you've just made me. Thank you.${prompt}
  10723: So what if I did? You got a problem-woblem with that?${prompt}
  10724: 'Anyway, I''ve discovered that in the end, adventaruing comes down to three things: strength of mind, strength of body, and the strength of fortune.${prompt}'
  10725: I understand that the wheel of fate does not stop in the same place-wace for everyone...${prompt}
  10726: '...but still, I can''t help but feel slightarued.${prompt}'
  10727: That's my honestaru opinion.${prompt}
  10728: I won't ask for your empathy-wempathy or to have the scales fall from your eyes, I just want you to comply with my dumb requestaru.${prompt}
  10729: '...Not at the expense of your own life, though. I wouldn''t want to have that on my conscience-wonscience. Take as many companions as you can gather and don''t do anything I wouldn''t...wait, then you wouldn''t even undertake this objective.${prompt}'
  10730: If the “Grudge” objective I gave you seems too difficultaru or dangerous, feel free to leave it for later-water.${prompt}
  10731: You must be the envy of pugilistarus the world over.${prompt}
  10732: To think that I was worried about you not coming back alive due to my exorbitantaru demands...${prompt}
  10733: |-
    How silly-willy of me.
    I should have known that it would take more than a flock of zealous friars to kill you.${prompt}
  10734: Especially with the aura of confidence you exertaru, I can never count you out of any fight.${prompt}
  10735: Well, now that you've cleared the emotional cloud-wouds that hung over my heart, I can quit in peace. Too bad I'll have to look for a new place to stay, since I can't use my Mog House any more.${prompt}
  10736: But before I go, take this as thanks for all you've done-wone.${prompt}
  10737: Toto! Toto! We're not in Xarcabard anymore!${prompt}
  10738: Wh-what are you all doing-woing here?${prompt}
  10739: There is something we simply could not wait to share with you, Nantoto.${prompt}
  10740: While I am willing to share my love with anyone at any time, this gift is more...substantial than that.${prompt}
  10741: I wanted to give you one of my teacherly hugs for motivation, but we decided on pouring our blood, sweat, and tears into getting you this instead. Enjoy!${prompt}
  10742: Why, this is...${prompt}
  10743: Go on and unrrravel it like a ball of yarn!${prompt}
  10744: But...why would you do this for a desertaru like me?${prompt}
  10745: No matter what you choose to do with your life henceforth, I have a feeling that you will end up using that to help us one way or another.${prompt}
  10746: Though my heart may swell with fraternal affection for all, it heals no one. Only you can cure the wounds of the masses. That scroll is best in your hands.${prompt}
  10747: I...I don't know what to say that won't sound tritaru...${prompt}
  10748: '${color-alt: 141}Nantoto uses ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.'
  10749: Nantoto learns a new spell!
  10750: I'm such a fool. I thought you'd given up on me, so I started actaruing like a meanie-weanie to you.${prompt}
  10751: In reality, though, <sniffle> you've had me in your heartarus all along... Waaah!${prompt}
  10752: Sorry, Toto. We would've said something to help brace you, but didn't want to spoil the element of surprrrise!${prompt}
  10753: I have to say that I expected our gift to bring a smile to your face, not tears to your eyes.${prompt}
  10754: It's just that...I believed you were avoiding me...so...${prompt}
  10755: I desperately wanted to tell you in advance, but Fhelm was dead set against it!${prompt}
  10756: I had no choice! You'd rrraise the fur on your back and hiss at us if we mentioned anything about a present.${prompt}
  10757: I...I'm touch-wouched. To think that I ever wanted to throw away my life as an adventurer...${prompt}
  10758: I've said so many terrible-werrible things, but...if you'd find it within yourselves to take me back...
  10759: Of course we do! Our bonds of friendship run deeper than the Sea of Shu'Meyo!${prompt}
  10760: The next time you're at a loss for an answer, remember to look to our collective love nestled deep inside you. It'll warm your soul like no other!${prompt}
  10761: I can't thank you...<sniffle>...enough...${prompt}
  10762: You will always have a spot behind my back, Nantoto, ever since you saved me from certain death.${prompt}
  10763: I still have the image of that day freshly imprintarued on my mind. We were fighting some harebrained warriors in the Valkurm Dunes--${prompt}
  10764: Could you please use a more flattering word like “audacious” or “venturous”? Otherwise, it makes me sound doubly pathetic for almost dying at their hands.${prompt}
  10765: You managed to pry me from death's icy grip, but we still had to flee in order to fight another day.${prompt}
  10766: And I met you on the hunt, rrright? Oh, how we used to fight like cats from dusk to dawn.${prompt}
  10767: |-
    Hahaha, we sure did.
    I remember having the most heated of argumentarus with you, then crying to Isakoth and Ervok afterwards.${prompt}
  10768: Assiduity and opportunity are one's most powerful assets on the path to enlightenment. The knowledge you gain from your travels across continents will be key to unlocking the gates to uncharted territories.${prompt}
  10769: Exploration is the testimony to one's courage. Likewise, Records of Eminence objectives are testimony to mankind's inquisitiveness.${prompt}
  10770: Myriad thoughts, feelings, and recollections are scattered over this vast land. We thus calmly gather them into our arms and release them anew unto the adventuring masses. We pay the price for our meddling, but so too do we reap the rewards. We dare, therefore we are.${prompt}
  10771: I could not have said it better myself!${prompt}
  10772: The influence each of you exerts during your eminent activities may be small in and of itself.${prompt}
  10773: However, those to whom you provide succor deeply appreciate your tireless efforts.${prompt}
  10774: Moreover, you do not provide aid exclusively to single individuals. Entire organizations also place their trust in you.${prompt}
  10775: Many within the A.M.A.N. possess financial resources the average commoner could only dream of. A chance opportunity from one of these individuals could yield untold riches.${prompt}
  10776: It is therefore no stretch of the imagination to say that we are able to subsist due to the noble work ethic of adventurers like you.${prompt}
  10777: In other words...scratch A.M.A.N.'s back, and it will scratch yours.${prompt}
  10778: I could not have said it better myself!${prompt}
  10779: For example, you have also made a pilgrimage to various telepoints scattered about the four corners of Vana'diel and dispersed the darkness that enshrouded the Eldieme Necropolis.${prompt}
  10780: These two objectives were both originally issued by a certain member of the San d'Orian elite.${prompt}
  10781: In contrast, the one Nantoto requested regarding an ouka ranman cannot be described as anything but an abnormality.${prompt}
  10782: 'That was one which I had to work behind the scenes to enact. If my memory serves me, you chose ${zone: 0[2]} as the spot in which to unleash your explosion of memories, correct?${prompt}'
  10783: Heh, fear not, for only you and I know that you consider that place a sanctuary. I will not tell a soul.${prompt}
  10784: Nor will I tell anyone about the valor you displayed in defeating the Yagudo High Priests to complete “Grudge.”${prompt}
  10785: '...However, I suppose Nantoto already knows that.${prompt}'
  10786: ${name-player}!${prompt}
  10787: I can't adequataruly express how much I owe you for taking out those Yagudo!${prompt}
  10788: 'Listen, we''ve all decided-wided to go to ${zone: 0[2]}...${prompt}'
  10789: We want to check on some reportarus concerning a humongous dragon that supposedly patrols the skies there.${prompt}
  10790: We've heard various rumors about a specific locale there where bounding insectarus gather. Hopefully we'll be able to find it.${prompt}
  10791: There's a mountain of hearsay about a flower there that floatarus in midair. I certainly want to see if it's actually real or not.${prompt}
  10792: There you are! I've been looking-wooking all over for you.${prompt}
  10793: I received a couple lettarus addressed to you.${prompt}
  10794: They all come in...uniquely colored envelope-wenvelopes and are signed “D.” What do you want to do with them?${prompt}
  10795: |-
    Open which one?
    ${selection-lines}
    None for the nonce.
    The white one.

    The gold one.
    The yellow one.
    The brown one.
    The red one.
    The rainbow one.${prompt}
  10796: I wouldn't open any if I were you, either. You never know what crazy-wazy stuff people deliver these days. I'd feel bad about throwing another person's property away, though, so I'll hold onto them for safekeeping.${prompt}
  10797: Here you go. I hope it doesn't contain anything too suspectaru.${prompt}
  10798: The envelope contains a briefing for a new objective.${prompt}

  10935: Ah, my apologies. Please allow me to explain. I used to be an adventurer myself and can therefore discern your strength with a mere glance.${prompt}
  10936: By chance, have you ever heard of the A.M.A.N. Reclaimers?${prompt}
  10937: They're a group that goes around collecting various items and equipment.${prompt}

  10939: And yours truly is in charge of coordinating the collection of those items!${prompt}
  10940: Well, I guess you could say I'm more of an employee doing the A.M.A.N.'s bidding. Hahaha...${prompt}
  10941: 'So, if you bring me some ${item-plural: 0[2]}, I''ll exchange them for various goods.${prompt}'
  10942: 'You can obtain ${item-plural: 0[2]} by completing these Records of Eminence objectives.${prompt}'
  10943: I have a feeling an adventurer of your caliber is more than up to the task. I wish you luck, friend!${prompt}
  10944: 'Stop by anytime and I''ll take any ${item-plural: 0[2]} that you manage to collect.${prompt}'
  10945: When you have saved up enough, you can exchange them for special orbs that contain monsters as well as the aforementioned refurbished goods.${prompt}
  10946: Hahaha! I know what you're thinking... Monsters? Inside of an orb?${prompt}
  10947: From what I hear, the A.M.A.N. recreated the technology behind the orbs that are exchanged for beastmen seals and repurposed it for this occasion.${prompt}
  10948: I guess the monsters are kind of a package deal along with the items! Hahaha!${prompt}
  10949: Although, I suppose you could say it makes the whole process that much more interesting.${prompt}
  10950: At any rate, I'm sure a hearty adventurer like yourself relishes such challenges!${prompt}
  10951: You simply need to take the orbs you obtain here and throw them into the burning circles in Yughott Grotto, the Palborough Mines, and Giddeus in order to remove the seals and cause the orbs' contents to spring forth.${prompt}
  10952: Oh, I should probably mention one more thing. The method for obtaining the contents of the chests is somewhat...unique.${prompt}
  10953: First, a total of one metal chest and ten wooden chests will emerge from the orb, although one of the wooden chests is actually a mimic. That is the monster I was referring to previously.${prompt}
  10954: You will receive the items once you open the metal chest. However, the more wooden chests you open before the metal one, the more items you'll receive!${prompt}
  10955: In other words, the more wooden chests you're able to open while avoiding the mimic, the more goodies you'll get after opening the metal chest!${prompt}
  10956: Obviously, you won't know whether a particular wooden chest is the mimic or not until you open it, so in the end, it pretty much comes down to sheer luck.${prompt}
  10957: '${color-alt: 15}Greyson smiles at you gently.'
  10958: Now then, if you'd like to know more about the orbs or anything else, feel free to ask away.${prompt}

    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  10969: It's been a pleasure doing business with you!${prompt}
  10970: 'Including the ${item-plural: 0[2]} I have on hand for you, you now have a total of ${number: 1} voucher${choice-plurality: 1}[/s]. Let me know if you wish to exchange any for an orb.${prompt}'
  10971: 'The A.M.A.N. Trove is based on the use of special items such as ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  10972: 'So, you want to know about the difference between ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}...${prompt}'
  10973: 'Basically, the difference comes down to the success rate of obtaining better-quality items. It''s much easier to hit it big and win higher-quality items with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  10974: 'Furthermore, the ${item-singular: 1[2]} ensures that at least one of your items will be of a certain quality.${prompt}'
  10975: Although, I imagine the definition of “quality” differs from person to person, so just think of it as a general guide.${prompt}
  10976: On a separate note, I heard a rumor when I first started that the more you bring to the A.M.A.N., the more items you'll receive.${prompt}
  10977: 'You can obtain ${item-plural: 0[2]} by completing the Records of Eminence objectives I gave you earlier.${prompt}'
  10978: 'And you can always buy them from me, too. However, there is a limit of ${number: 8} vouchers per month (Earth time) in order to prevent people from hoarding all of the items for themselves.${prompt}'
  10979: Hm? You wish to know more about me personally? Well, I used to be an adventurer myself, you see.${prompt}
  10980: I might not look the part, but I fought on the front lines in many strange lands, earning merit points as a warrior, ninja, and various other jobs.${prompt}
  10981: However, I made an important discovery about myself while leading that life.${prompt}
  10982: I found that being forced to do things a certain way all in the name of efficiency kind of defeated the whole purpose of being an adventurer.${prompt}
  10983: I felt that even though it might not always be the best way, it was important to be versatile when it came to party formations, fighting styles, and the like.${prompt}
  10984: When I thought about it like that, I decided to retire and become a merchant in order to help like-minded adventurers in their journeys.${prompt}
  10985: To that end, I purchased items that people no longer needed and looked to sell them in places where they were wanted...${prompt}
  10986: However, I had trouble making ends meet and, as you can see from the looks of me, ended up quite poor. So, with nothing but the clothes on my back, I trudged on until I was introduced to this job by a contact from my adventurer days.${prompt}
  10987: Now, I'm able to at least put food on the table while still realizing my dream of helping other adventurers, so it was all worth it.${prompt}
  10988: 'Of course, I''m happy if I can turn a small profit along the way too, so I''d appreciate it if you could buy some ${item-plural: 0[2]} from me as well!${prompt}'
  10989: 'I have received a total of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} from you so far. Let me know if you wish to trade some of them for an orb.${prompt}'
  10990: Um... I'm sorry, but you can't carry any more. Would you like to exchange some for an orb or two?${prompt}
