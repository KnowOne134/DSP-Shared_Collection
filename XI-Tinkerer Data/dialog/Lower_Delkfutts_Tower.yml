  7402: Ah, what a grand sight...${prompt}
  7403: |-
    The five mothercrystals...
    It is this contraption that protects them as they slumber beneath Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7404: |-
    Protects them...?
    So, that is the purpose of this tower!?${prompt}
  7405: |-
    Exactly.
    The five crystals are connected by the five Crystal Lines that all converge on this very place.${prompt}
  7406: For many centuries we have monitored the lines...protected the radiance of the crystals.${prompt}
  7407: However, when the Wyrmking, Bahamut, arrived, the five crystal lines began acting strangely. We could no longer control them.${prompt}
  7408: And then came Selh'teus.${prompt}
  7409: He came...here?${prompt}
  7410: Sir Nag'molada! Are you saying that the boy came here via the Crystal Line!?${prompt}
  7411: Which means, by traveling back through the line, he can...${prompt}
  7412: Exactly. He can reach the fifth crystal. However, it is not as easy as you may think. The lines were not built as a path for men.${prompt}
  7413: They were built to gather the light of the mothercrystals.${prompt}
  7414: The true reason Selh'teus was able to enter this place was because he was aided by a guardian of the crystals--a terrestrial avatar.${prompt}
  7415: A terrestrial avatar...?${prompt}
  7416: It is all clear now! Phoenix led me to this place to show me the way to the celestial capital of Al'Taieu!${prompt}
  7417: |-
    Phoenix? Led you here?
    That is truly unfortunate.
    If this only had happened before Pso'Xja was reactivated...${prompt}
  7418: Reactivated...? What do you mean by that, Nag'molada?${prompt}
  7419: The ruins of Pso'Xja were once the homes of my Kuluu brothers and sisters. However, at the onset of the Kuluu war with the Zilart, the terrestrial avatars lent us their power and helped transform the area into an impenetrable stronghold.${prompt}
  7420: And deep below the ruins is a device that blocks the flow of energy through the Crystal Line. Esha'ntarl has repaired that device...${prompt}
  7421: |-
    Repaired it!
    Why would she do such a thing!?${prompt}
  7422: I no longer know what the society is plotting. That is why I came here--to find out their true intentions!${prompt}
  7423: '...${prompt}'
  7424: |-
    Ha ha ha!
    Are you surprised?${prompt}
  7425: I guess that to you we ancients--Kuluu and Zilart--are all the same. However, that could not be further from the truth.${prompt}
  7426: The Zilart were blessed with the ability to subliminally communicate with all those around them--they possessed the “whisper of the soul.” It was this ability that made the bonds between them unbreakable.${prompt}
  7427: However, there were those who were born without the whisper--the Kuluu. My people were destined from birth to sit outside the bonds of the Zilartian community.${prompt}
  7428: But we bystanders were able to ascertain the truth, and it was this that helped us survive the crusades of ten thousand years ago.${prompt}
  7429: |-
    The Zilart, the terrestrial avatars, Selh'teus...
    Once again, their sins will deface Vana'diel and undermine her children.${prompt}
  7430: |-
    That is terrible!
    If you know of such a battle brewing, why do you not attempt to stop it!?${prompt}
  7431: Why must we fight the avatars!? Such a battle would be meaningless! Our true enemies are the Emptiness and the evil boy that is spreading it!${prompt}
  7432: |-
    Hah.
    Is that what you have to say? Tenzen, when are you going to stop being led around on a leash like a measly dog? When are you going to see what the terrestrial avatars really want?${prompt}
  7433: Listen. I told you this once before. Selh'teus is nothing but a traitor.${prompt}
  7434: |-
    Ten thousand years ago, he prevented the Zilart from obtaining what they desired.
    Now, he is simply attempting the same thing.${prompt}
  7435: The records stored in this Crystal Line observation equipment have shown me the reason why Selh'teus travels to the mothercrystals.${prompt}
  7436: By touching the shards, he is able to drain their light...their power.${prompt}
  7437: The crystal's power?${prompt}
  7438: To accomplish our task, we had to gather the power of the crystals and fuse it into one.${prompt}
  7439: And to do that, we needed to repair and revive the Zilartian machines that were damaged in the accident that occurred ten thousand years ago. With the machines working again, we were able to slowly draw the light of the crystals.${prompt}
  7440: When he realized he could not single-handedly take on the whole nation of Jeuno, he turned to the crystals instead. And when he laid his hands upon them, their power flowed from the facets like water rushing from a broken dam. This sudden loss of power resulted in a disruption in the space surrounding the crystals...${prompt}
  7441: Without the life-giving light of the crystals shining upon it, the space became overwhelmed with darkness--with Emptiness.${prompt}
  7442: But, Selh'teus first appeared on Vana'diel the same time as Bahamut.${prompt}
  7443: In my home nation, there were many reports of the Emptiness eating its way through the land, long before Bahamut even arrived...${prompt}
  7444: |-
    Wait!
    You just said that you were “slowly drawing the light of the crystals”...${prompt}
  7445: That would mean that the cause of the Emptiness in the East is you--the Zilart!${prompt}
  7446: |-
    Hmph.
    I was beginning to wonder when you would realize that, Tenzen.${prompt}
  7447: But don't misunderstand us. It was never our intention to harm Vana'diel with the Emptiness.${prompt}
  7448: While we lay in slumber for the past ten thousand years, things changed. The crystals changed.${prompt}
  7449: Especially the fifth crystal, deep below Al'Taieu.${prompt}
  7450: When the celestial capital was destroyed and sunk to the bottom of the sea, the crystal was damaged. The data that it returns is very odd indeed.${prompt}
  7451: However, you need not worry. Once the Gate of the Gods is opened, the crystals will return to their former state.${prompt}
  7452: And once they do, the Emptiness will disappear in the crystal's radiance, and the Zilart will have accomplished their dream.${prompt}
  7453: Only the wretched terrestrial avatars stand in our way...!${prompt}
  7454: |-
    That is enough!
    Before I slice you in two, I will give you the opportunity to recall the words of Diabolos!${prompt}
  7455: |-
    Wake up!
    You are all bound like marionettes by the chains of Promathia!${prompt}
  7456: When the Gates of Paradise open, our world will be no more!${prompt}
  7457: But with an end always comes a new beginning...${prompt}
  7458: |-
    Tenzen!
    Have you asked your precious Phoenix what actually happens when our world “is no more”?${prompt}
  7459: What do you mean!?${prompt}
  7460: |-
    Yes.
    The world we live in now is nothing but an illusion.
    Compared to Paradise, Vana'diel is a cesspool festering with pain and suffering, lost hopes and dreams...${prompt}
  7461: |-
    Strict values waver in the winds of uncertainty, while you pilfer your precious time struggling to recognize the truths that peer back at you through the darkness.
    You are inclined to search aimlessly for hints of who you truly are, though you rarely discover them, and it is this failure that ultimately forces you to tread a vague path through your miserable lives.${prompt}
  7462: |-
    Even confessions of the soul result in disagreement and inconsistency, thrusting your pitiful masses into utter chaos.
    It is this chaos that breeds evil--an evil that propels you into justifying deeds of malevolence to maintain your false sense of purity.${prompt}
  7463: |-
    You were born into this world and this is the only world you know.
    That is why you fear its end. You fear it and you fight it.${prompt}
  7464: The terrestrial avatars recognized this characteristic of your people and have used it to their advantage. Why? Have you ever wondered why the terrestrial avatars are named so? It is because they, too, were born on Vana'diel. If Vana'diel returns to Paradise, they will be nothing but mere animals!${prompt}
  7465: B-but...${prompt}
  7466: You people are nothing but puppets, your strings tied to the fingers of the terrestrial avatars, destined to a life of slavery. Why not open your eyes to the truth?${prompt}
  7467: Now that you realize your true enemies are the avatars who claim to protect you, your journey through the darkness is over.${prompt}
  7468: You can leave the rest to me. I shall change your destinies.${prompt}
  7469: '...!${prompt}'
  7470: |-
    The light Selh'teus has gathered from the mothercrystals...
    If the celestial capital of Al'Taieu still does exist, then the Zilart's plan is...${prompt}
  7471: This monitoring device will inform me of the crystal's memories... The memories will guide me...${prompt}
  7472: Let your memories show me the truth I seek!${prompt}
  7473: |-
    Argh...
    I'm only receiving partial data...
    There's still too much interference coming from the fifth crystal...${prompt}
  7474: |-
    But that image...
    I've seen it somewhere before... It was...the Chamber of Eventide.
    And that was Esha'ntarl!${prompt}
  7475: |-
    Yes...
    It's all clear now...
  7476: Could it be...?${prompt}
  7477: Nag'molada said that the terrestrial avatars are using us... Using us to prevent people from waking up and realizing the truth...?${prompt}
  7478: |-
    But if that is true...
    The people who gave their lives for this flame...
    I... I...${prompt}
  7479: Phoenix! Answer me!${prompt}
  7480: To grant you this form, lives were lost, villages destroyed...${prompt}
  7481: The lifeblood you drank from my people...was it not to save Vana'diel!? Was it not to breathe hope back into her children!?${prompt}
  7482: |-
    ...
    And once again you tell me to visit Fenrir...${prompt}
  7483: Where? The southern tower of Pso'Xja?${prompt}
  7484: Is that all!?${prompt}
  7485: We shall see what truths the final avatar presents us with. We shall see if we are simply being made fools of!${prompt}
  7486: Something huge is bearing down upon you!${prompt}
  7487: Now is not the time for that!${prompt}

  7800: The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called “Voidwalkers.” Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt}
  7801: |-
    Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.
    This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt}
  7802: Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt}
  7803: A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt}
  7804: Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt}
  7805: |-
    Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.
    Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt}
  7806: Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt}
  7807: Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt}
  7808: However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt}
  7809: |-
    When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.
    These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt}
  7810: Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt}
  7811: The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt}
  7812: |-
    Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.
    Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt}
  7813: As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt}
  7814: Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt}
  7815: Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt}
  7816: After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt}
  7817: Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt}
  7818: Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  7819: While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  7820: Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt}
  7821: Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt}
  7822: Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt}
  7823: Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt}
  7824: Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt}
  7825: The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt}
  7826: The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt}
  7827: Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt}
  7828: 'Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt}'

  7830: Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}
  7831: Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.${prompt}
  7832: Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.${prompt}
  7833: As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.${prompt}

    Are you all right?
    What happened?${prompt}
  11789: It is nothing. I needed a few days of respite.${prompt}
  11790: |-
    I pray it was the orb that led you here?
    For a brief moment I feared that we would not meet again in this world.${prompt}
  11791: I have learned that all the energies of the mothercrystals converge upon this very tower.${prompt}
  11792: '...And that is why I have come. To see if we may be able to borrow but a fraction so that we may set things right.${prompt}'

    The crystal...it murmured something to me...${wait-36: 2}
    “The chains of Promathia.”${prompt}
  11794: Perhaps there is another trial for you to overcome.${prompt}
  11795: I ask you, please do as the crystal bids.${prompt}
  11796: Behind every door you open is another meeting that could decide the fate of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  11797: The crystal has laid out a path for you to walk, and I fear it is one you must traverse without my aid.${prompt}
  11798: You must strive ever forward, finding a chance meeting that could decide the fate of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  11799: The crystal has laid out a path for you to walk, and I fear it is one you must traverse without my aid.${prompt}
  11800: The orb cries out for light...your journey is what will fill it with everlasting radiance.${prompt}
  11801: Master, another path was laid before you, and as you walked it you encountered one who would shape your future.${prompt}
  11802: There is but one last step you must take to bring light unto the orb.${prompt}
  11803: Did it not show you a particular person when it guided you here?${prompt}
  11804: '...It does not surprise me to hear that Prishe appeared before you.${prompt}'
  11805: Oft would you speak to me of the adventures the two of you shared.${prompt}

    Have anything to say?

    I'd like you to meet Tenzen.
    Where will you go?${prompt}
  11808: You...you wish for me to meet a man named Tenzen from the Far East?${prompt}
  11809: I should not be so taken aback. It is only natural for my path to cross with his in this era.${prompt}
  11810: Of course I am intimately familiar with...Sir Tenzen.${prompt}
  11811: He was the one who strongly insisted that I train under you and learn all I can.${prompt}
  11812: So it shall be.${prompt}
  11813: But before that can happen, you must pass the trials set before you by the chains of Promathia.${prompt}
  11814: Recall what happened between you and Lion. The flow of even the mightiest river can be altered with a single stone.${prompt}
  11815: Although I had hoped to give my regards to Prishe in person first.${prompt}
  11816: But perhaps you are right--meeting with Sir Tenzen is paramount.${prompt}
  11817: The appearance of new rifts in Vana'diel has surely not escaped your notice.${prompt}
  11818: I feel it prudent to examine them for myself.${prompt}
  11819: While you are pursuing your destiny regarding the chains of Promathia, I will go on ahead and learn what I can about Escha.${prompt}
  11820: Recall what happened between you and Lion. The flow of even the mightiest river can be altered with a single stone.${prompt}
  11821: Although I had hoped to give my regards to Prishe in person first.${prompt}
  11822: But perhaps you are right--meeting with Sir Tenzen is paramount.${prompt}
  11823: With your leave.${prompt}
  11824: This leaves me with just one question--where can I meet with Sir Tenzen?${prompt}
  11825: |-
    Where can Tenzen be found?
    ${selection-lines}
    Jeuno?
    Tavnazia?
    The Far East?${prompt}
  11826: It stands to reason he would visit the fabled city. Let us rendezvous in Ru'Lude Gardens and seek him out.${prompt}
  11827: That certainly is one possibility. Then let us head for Tavnazia.${prompt}
  11828: Hold!${prompt}
  11829: Who is--
  11830: Is that...Kagero?${prompt}
  11831: How do you know my name?${prompt}
  11832: Sir Tenzen makes way for Ru'Lude Gardens. You, too, would do best not to delay.${prompt}
  11833: I shall ensure that Sir Tenzen arrives in Jeuno safely. I bid you await him in Ru'Lude Gardens.${prompt}
  11834: Then the path before us is clear.${prompt}
  11835: I find it doubtful that he would head back after having arrived only some few days before. Perhaps he is elsewhere?${prompt}
