    Yes, you're rightaru.
    I need to be more of a villainy-willain, and start being suspicious of people.${prompt}
  7507: 'Now that you mention it, I rolled dice with ${choice: 0}[her/him].${prompt}'
  7508: And that Mithra over there was the one who came to my hideout.${prompt}
  7509: |-
    ...More than half of us have been unmasked.
    I'm going to take care of this while there are no witnesses...${prompt}
  7510: |-
    You forget, Kanika.
    Atarefaunet's band is no more. We are now known as Vauderame's Knights.${prompt}
  7511: I waited twenty years for the former Marquis to remember everything. All that is left is to restore the glory of our lost kingdom.${prompt}
  7512: But Vauderame, these guys have seen what's in the chest. If we don't knock 'em off now, there's bound to be trouble later.${prompt}
  7513: The royal scepter has already found its way into that Mithra's pocket. Even if her knowledge of its history is lacking, she still has a nose for value.${prompt}
  7514: Not one of you has changed, even after all these years. Luckily, I was prepared for this.${prompt}
  7515: '...Take care of it.${prompt}'
  7516: |-
    ...This is all of it, Vauderame.
    The whole set of knights' equipment is here, just as it used to be. The smell of the past still clings to it.${prompt}
  7517: It will be gone by the time we reach Tavnazia. Mightaru be a good idea to lose that tummy-wummy on the way, as well.${prompt}
  7518: I'll get rid of the rust. I brought the gear with me.${prompt}
  7519: '...Are you sure about those two? It''s not like you to leave loose ends, even if their memory has been erased.${prompt}'
  7520: Mithra might seem wild and free, but they are deeply tied to one another. If we kill this one now, others will come looking for revenge. They will chase us to the ends of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7521: |-
    Then there is this adventurer.
    ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] looks like someone I did away with in another time...${prompt}

    ...Perhaps you're right.
    A foothold into the country I have spent twenty years restoring...
    Maybe my ego demands a witness to all that I have accomplished.${prompt}
  7524: '...Vauderame. We will await you and the Marquis in our homeland.${prompt}'

    I will join you as soon as I can.

    Hey!
    The catnap is over!${prompt}

    You're finally up...
    We were caught by a trrrap on the treasure chest and sent into dreamland. It took me by surprise.${prompt}

    I thought I had disarmed the trap, but...
    Now my head is all woozy and I can't think straight.${prompt}
  7530: '...Anyway, there was nothing of great value in the chest.${prompt}'
  7531: The thief boots I found in there...I already put them in your pack. They're a little worse for wear, but being part of Atarefaunet's treasure, they should be worth a bit.${prompt}
  7532: All that's left are a couple of gems, which I claim for myself. I have those two kittens to feed--you know how it is.${prompt}
  7533: Time to leave this place behind. Although I would like to see Vauderame's face when he opens the chest to find it empty...${prompt}
  7534: |-
    ...Hmmm.
    I get the feeling there's something important I'm forgetting...${prompt}

    Our opponent is a heinous criminal. Your cooperation in this matter is highly appreciated.${prompt}
  7637: What word on our quarry?${prompt}
  7638: |-
    Sir!
    He appears to be resting up within Ordelle's Caves. This is our chance to bring the knave to justice!${prompt}
  7639: This is merely a trap. A ruse to draw us into a battlefield of his choosing. Who knows how many allies lie in ambush within?${prompt}
  7640: An ambush...${prompt}
  7641: Do not underestimate this villain. I know this breed; they are wily and treacherous. It is not unlikely that this thief of ours is a feared member of the underworld who has survived through countless battles and tight spots.${prompt}
  7642: What in Altana's name was that burst of light?${prompt}
  7643: No matter. I must set out for San d'Oria without delay. Everything depends on this mission's success.${prompt}

    A Royal Knight? But there's something different that I cannot quite...?
    You there, state your name!${prompt}

    My apologies, sir!
    He was acting so suspiciously, I just assumed...${prompt}
  7651: A wild goose chase. I should have known this was too easy.${prompt}
  7652: The others must have gone on ahead. What a sorry state of affairs.${prompt}
  7653: Ah, now I see! You are my guides, disguised as Temple Knights. You've come to lead me in from the storm, am I correct?${prompt}
  7654: |-
    Storm? There was no storm.
    What were you doing out here, anyway?${prompt}
  7655: I was on my way to deliver the Scepter Royaulais to the Chateau d'Oraguille. You should already know this. Now, enough of this meaningless chitchat. Take me to the capital immediately.${prompt}
  7656: The Scepter Royaulais?${prompt}
  7657: You have it on your person? Quickly now, hand it over.${prompt}
  7658: |-
    I think not, my good sir.
    My mission is to deliver the Scepter Royaulais to the king's brother, Prince Fellenant, and him alone.${prompt}

  7660: Clap this man in irons. He'll be accompanying us back to the chateau.${prompt}

  7662: Take your hands off me, I say!${prompt}
  7663: |-
    That man...
    He has a role to play in all of this, I am certain.${prompt}

  7665: Oh, and please mention to that guard that we won't be needing any further assistance after all.${prompt}
  7666: You have found the villain who stole the Scepter Royaulais? There is no mistake this time?${prompt}
  7667: Sir! He exactly matches the man in the sketches we have!${prompt}
  7668: Millechairale is no thief! Please, let me go and persuade him to give up the scepter!${prompt}
  7669: Stand down, citizen. You know the penalty for interfering with a Temple Knight investigation.${prompt}
  7670: I beg you! Listen to me!${prompt}
  7671: Back off, I say!${prompt}
  7672: Sir! The thief has emerged from another cave exit!${prompt}

  7681: I was instructed to give you this.${prompt}
  7682: The Scepter Royaulais...${prompt}
  7683: I do not...?${prompt}
  7684: Please, just take it! I have been requested to give this to the first knight I meet on this day, at this time, in this place.${prompt}
  7685: One moment, young man. Why me? Who asked you to do such a thing?${prompt}
  7686: Vijartal Caphieux.${prompt}
  7687: Vijartal...?${prompt}
  7688: A secret legacy has been passed down by word of mouth in my family for generations. It is an oath made to a distant ancestor. A duty that I must fulfill.${prompt}
  7689: An ancestor? You mean that you...${prompt}
  7690: Yes. My sister and I bear the Caphieux name. Our family is that of the famous hero, Vijartal Caphieux.${prompt}
  7691: Which would mean that I made this request myself? I would need the Pierre Errante of the Scepter Royaulais to return to my own time...${prompt}
  7692: Millechairale!${prompt}
  7693: Roido...${prompt}
  7694: |-
    You had us worried...
    You shouldn't have put yourself in such danger just to fulfill that oath of yours.${prompt}
  7695: I am sorry for the trouble I've caused. But it was the will of Vijartal Caphieux. I wanted to answer the request of my most respected ancestor, no matter what it took.${prompt}
  7696: '...${prompt}'
  7697: They have found me!${prompt}
  7698: Quickly! You must flee before they arrive!${prompt}
  7699: Vijartal, ${name-player}. Take Millechairale and get out of here. You should be able to escape from another tunnel deeper in the caves.${prompt}
  7700: Roido!${prompt}
  7701: Are you insane!? If you stay here, things will not go lightly for you!${prompt}
  7702: Please, hurry! There's no time to debate the issue!${prompt}
  7703: Why do you do this...?${prompt}
  7704: Even if I am not of the same race or bloodline, I need no reason to protect my family!${prompt}
  7705: Roido...${prompt}
  7706: Bastok, San d'Oria--none of that is important! Don't you understand? Surely you have someone who you would die to protect, no matter the consequences?${prompt}
  7707: '!!!${prompt}'
  7708: For me, those people are Phillone and Millechairale. Now please, just go!${prompt}
  7709: |-
    Wait...
    There is one way to save all of us...${prompt}
  7710: |-
    I see what she means now.
    The most important thing is understanding...${prompt}
  7711: Vijartal?${prompt}
  7712: Do not resist the Temple Knights when they come. Leave everything to me.${prompt}
  7713: You have nowhere left to run! Hand over the Scepter Royaulais!${prompt}
  7714: Roido, you have made me realize that Bastokers are not to be so easily dismissed. There is something to Prince Fellenant's reasoning after all. I see now why I cannot allow him to be assassinated.${prompt}
  7715: It is just like the last time... These caves are responding in some way to the Pierre Errante. Did you know that this place was once known as the “Shrine of Endless Travels”?${prompt}
  7716: Vijartal...?${prompt}
  7717: There is nothing to fear. Please let Phillone know that I need no thanks; I already have my reward. I am the Obsidian Bolt, such deeds are my reason for living...!${prompt}
  7718: We have you now, thief! Surrender quietly!${prompt}
  7719: He's vanished! Where is the knight that accompanied you? Sorcery...!?${prompt}
  7720: Wait...this is the Scepter Royaulais!${prompt}
  7721: Now we have the thief and the scepter in our possession.${prompt}
  7722: '...${prompt}'
  7723: I have my suspicions that you aided the thief in his crime, but for the moment I will let that small detail pass. We will see what the villain confesses, however.${prompt}
  7724: This can't be happening. I've failed to protect Millechairale...${prompt}
  7725: Sir Elmemague has taken the suspect to the chateau for questioning. It's back to regular training drills for us.${prompt}
  7726: We have received a report from Sir Elmemague that the suspect we apprehended wasn't the criminal after all. We must be ready to send word to the chateau if any other suspicious characters are sighted.${prompt}
  7727: Thanks to our effective training drills, we were able to capture the new suspect with little trouble. Although I do wonder where that other knight disappeared to...${prompt}
  7728: The suspect appears to have taken refuge within Ordelle's Caves. We will follow our training drills and stick to our posts!${prompt}
  7729: Our rigorous training drills have shown their worth. That preparation honed the skills we needed to handle the situation this day.${prompt}
  7730: |-
    Another suspect has been discovered in Ordelle's Caves! We must be ready to move at a moment's notice!
    Take care to stay out of our way.${prompt}
  7731: We have succeeded not once, but twice at capturing a suspected criminal. I'm certain that this will be the site for developing even more effective training exercises in the future.${prompt}
  7732: I have spoken with Sir Elmemague. Narvecaint is currently monitoring the suspect's movements from the entrance to the caves.${prompt}
  7733: |-
    Well, I suppose we can regard this as an adequate performance. It will still be necessary to further refine our soldiers' training...
    However, this was an excellent opportunity for the knights to practice their skills in a real-life situation.${prompt}
  7734: Another chance to test the effectiveness of our training in almost exactly the same setting! This time, I expect perfect coordination and execution from my men.${prompt}
  7735: Hmm, there is still room for improvement. They need to work on communication to facilitate speedier responses... Lady Curilla will not be pleased.${prompt}
  7736: There is nothing out of the ordinary here.${prompt}

  7760: Calm down, Ayame. ${choice-player-gender}[He's/She's] an adventurer. It's ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] job to go adventuring.${prompt}
  7761: We're here to investigate something. It could get pretty dangerous, so I suggest taking a few steps back if you know what's good for you.${prompt}
  7762: Why, Cid. What business do you have here today?${prompt}
  7763: Well, if it isn't little Wolfgang. How have you been?${prompt}
  7764: We're here to check out the Crystal Line. Recently I've been receiving some very strange readings from this area.${prompt}
  7765: According to the data retrieved by a Republican party that visited here last month, the once stable energy flow has begun to fluctuate.${prompt}
  7766: I've never seen such high readings...${prompt}
  7767: The flow of energy is so overwhelming that the Telepoint you see over there was shattered to pieces! And now there are reports that a giant beast appeared over the sea, just to the north of Delkfutt's Tower.${prompt}

    Not exactly.
    We have numerous parties investigating the situation. However, many of those sent into the field have...vanished.${prompt}

  7777: |-
    Common rumor has it that one can meet here with the terrestrial avatar Carbuncle.

  7778: |-
    Carbuncle, bringer of rainbows!
    I am Tenzen of the Far East, sent here across the seas at the behest of Phoenix!${prompt}
  7779: The Keeper of the Apocalypse has come to Vana'diel, and four of the mothercrystals are besieged by darkness!${prompt}
  7780: Yet in the face of this crisis, Bahamut and Diabolos do nothing to defend them.${prompt}
  7781: Diabolos draws souls into his dreamworld to shelter people from the Emptiness.${prompt}
  7782: And Bahamut rallies his wyrms for the destruction of every last person on Vana'diel in the name of some ancient pact!${prompt}
  7783: |-
    Carbuncle.
    We all carry the curse of Promathia within us...${prompt}
  7784: And it is not within our power to lift this bane...${prompt}
  7785: |-
    But I cannot accept this as justification for genocide!
    We were born as a part of fate's design, and we will live the lives we have been given!${prompt}
  7786: |-
    You, who have brought the soul of Phoenix across the waves.
    And you, who carries the blessings of the mothercrystal.${prompt}
  7787: You have finally come into contact with the will of Promathia...${prompt}
  7788: I knew that even should the past be ground into dust, there would come a time when people would uncover the truth.${prompt}
  7789: No matter how tightly sealed, as long as it exists alongside the mothercrystal, Promathia's will shall one day awaken.${prompt}
  7790: |-
    That is why I have come to guide you.
    Guide you to the power of the slumbering gods.${prompt}
  7791: As many people as possible must possess this strength to prevent the awakening of the Twilight God.${prompt}
  7792: |-
    The slumbering gods...
    You speak of the great avatars that dream away their existence in every corner of Vana'diel?${prompt}
  7793: '...!?'
  7794: I sense that Phoenix does not approve of my actions.${prompt}
  7795: He who tries to save the world and he who tries to save mankind... Bahamut and Diabolos would also surely oppose me if they knew of my plans.${prompt}
  7796: Every time the power of the avatars is granted to a person, it hastens the awakening of the sleeping gods.${prompt}
  7797: If the siphoning of energy continues, the boundaries of the crystal world they protect will shatter, and their true forms will manifest upon this world of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7798: And then a furious battle will ensue between the terrestrial avatars and the newly awakened gods.${prompt}
  7799: But I believe that this is the only option remaining to prevent Promathia's rebirth.${prompt}
  7800: The awakening of Promathia draws near.${prompt}
  7801: With the Keeper of the Apocalypse now among us, all that remains is for the Gates of Paradise to be opened...${prompt}
  7802: |-
    I don't understand.
    Has not the pursuit for the Gates of Paradise all been the result of Promathia's curse?${prompt}
  7803: If so, then everything has been for the purpose of awakening the Twilight God...${prompt}
  7804: |-
    Carbuncle!
    Destroying his minion ourselves is the only way to save the children of Altana!${prompt}
  7805: |-
    I beg of you to lend us the strength we need!
    Please tell us where to find the Keeper of the Apocalypse!${prompt}
  7806: |-
    You shine so brilliantly...
    I know that guiding light well.${prompt}
  7807: It is the light standing at your side, merging with your own, that so fills you with hope.${prompt}
  7808: |-
    Very well.
    I will grant you my assistance.${prompt}
  7809: You will help us!?${prompt}
  7810: Thirty years ago, I sensed the birth of the Keeper of the Apocalypse.${prompt}
  7811: After a number of years the presence faded, and I can no longer sense its location.${prompt}
  7812: However, the fiery bird of resurrection will continue to lead your steps on this journey.${prompt}
  7813: And that is why I will lend my strength to Phoenix's diminished soul...${prompt}
  7814: |-
    You have our thanks!
    Bringer of rainbows, I am delirious with joy at your words!${prompt}
  7815: |-
    Do not rejoice just yet, Tenzen.
    The energy I will share with Phoenix does not exist here.${prompt}
  7816: |-
    It can be found in the city built by the Kuluu on the outskirts of the Zilartian capital.
    A place known as Pso'Xja.${prompt}
  7817: The power we granted the Kuluu in ancient times should still be sealed within that city.${prompt}
  7818: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Venture deep within the ruins and open Carbuncle's gate.
    With the knowledge you now hold, you should be able to operate the device that lies within.${prompt}
  7819: |-
    As I have no strength for battle, this is the best that I can do...
    But I am sure you will find it helpful.${prompt}
  7820: |-
    Carbuncle!
    We are in your debt!${prompt}

    ${name-player}!
    This is the first terrestrial avatar to aid us in our cause.
    For the others, it will be welcome news indeed!${prompt}
  7822: |-
    But first we must secure the energy that is sealed within the ruins of Pso'Xja.
    Let us rendezvous before the gate of Carbuncle!${prompt}

  7843: You know about the sleeping gods...the avatars that guard the protocrystals?${prompt}
  7844: I am as different to those beings as fire is to water, and yet we share the same desire to protect Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7845: That is why I aided the blossoming of their power within you and your fellow adventurers.${prompt}
  7846: I believed that if their aspects fought beside you, they would learn from an existence that had lost the gift of eternity.${prompt}
  7847: Finally, the sleeping gods begin to stir from their slumber.${prompt}
  7848: Will they consent to join us in our roles as guardians of Vana'diel?${prompt}
  7849: |-
    I hope to ask this very question to an old friend of mine who resides at the Full Moon Fountain.
    A very, very old friend...${prompt}
  7850: But in order to wake him, I need a vast source of energy.${prompt}
  7851: I hope to visit the Full Moon Fountain, and ask the sleeping Fenrir to see what the future holds.${prompt}
  7852: But in order to wake him from his weakened torpor, I need an energy source of immense proportions.${prompt}
  7853: |-
    That is where you come in.
    If you could gather the power of the sleeping gods and bring it to the Full Moon Fountain, we might have a chance.${prompt}

  7862: That is what saved us at the end.${prompt}
  7863: Unfortunately, it did not have the desired effect...${prompt}
  7864: |-
    You were never meant to submit to the will of the sleeping gods.
    And I will never lose my faith in the children of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7865: Even those ancient beings will one day learn a great truth from mortals.${prompt}
  7866: |-

  11181: |-
    What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo!
    Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!${prompt}
  11182: |-
    We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers.
    But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!${prompt}

    There! I've whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me.
    Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!${prompt}
  11184: |-
    Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo.
    Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom.
    It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!${prompt}
  11185: The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!${prompt}
  11186: |-
    In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign.
    Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.${prompt}
  11187: Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...${prompt}
  11188: |-
    King Kupofried was greatly dismayed.
    How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?${prompt}
  11189: In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.${prompt}
  11190: “Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo,” he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.${prompt}
  11191: |-
    Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin.
    A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?${prompt}
  11192: |-
    We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition.
    We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!${prompt}

    I'm in charge of running the ${choice: 0}[beginner/intermediate/advanced] level Smilebringer Boot Camp in this area.${prompt}
  11243: |-
    I'd be thrilled to answer any questions you might have...and of course, sign you up, too!

  11246: |-
    It'd be my pleasure! Here goes nothing! Ahem!
    The Smilebringer Boot Camp was established for two purposes, the first being the ongoing training and conditioning of smilebringers. The second--and this is where you come in, yay!--is for us to scout hopefuls from the adventurer community to join our jovial ranks!${prompt}
  11247: The population of vicious monsters has grown in recent years, you see. And because of this, more smilebringers were being--<gasp!>--injured in the line of duty than ever before.${prompt}

  11251: |-
    The rules are as simple as sunshine. Smilebringer's honor!

  11252: |-
    Talk to the smile helpers and they'll confirm your passage.
    The route you take is completely up to you--just be sure you don't miss any checkpoints. You got all that? Hmmm?${prompt}
  11253: I'll mark each smile helper's location on your map beforehand, so you don't need to worry about getting lost.${prompt}
  11254: Once you've finished visiting all the checkpoints, you have to--you guessed it!--come back and report to me. It's okay, I won't bite!${prompt}
  11255: What I will do, though, is tell you how quickly you completed the course. After all, to a smilebringer, speed is everything. Some folks run faster with a fell beast hot on their tail, but we smilebringers need no more than the thought of a child's laughter to spur us on! Zoom zoom!${prompt}
  11256: Oh, and I should mention that at this time of year, we're collecting donations in the form of a small fee to participate in the training. All proceeds go towards presents for the children during the Starlight Celebration. Thank you for your cooperation!${prompt}
  11257: |-
    One more thing you should know. If you venture out of the area, the training will automatically be canceled.
    But I can trust you not to walk out on your favorite smile sergeant, right? Hmmm?
  11258: |-
    So far, the fastest time in this area is ${number: 5} minute${choice-plurality: 5}[/s] ${number: 6} second${choice-plurality: 6}[/s]. Wow!
    And the name of the greased lightning who set this record is ${entity: 0}. Don't be forgetting that, you hear?${prompt}

    We'd like all participants to complete this area's course within ${number: 1} minute${choice-plurality: 1}[/s] ${number: 2} second${choice-plurality: 2}[/s]. A piece of cake for a strapping young ${choice-player-gender}[wolf/vixen] like you, surely!
    And if you manage a time quicker than ${number: 3} minute${choice-plurality: 3}[/s] ${number: 4} second${choice-plurality: 4}[/s]...then you and I had better trade places! Oh, that would be so much fun, wouldn't it?${prompt}
  11260: |-
    Awww... You've made this smile sergeant very sad...
    But I'll be glued to this spot, because I just know you'll be back to turn my frown upside down! Yes siree!
  11261: |-
    At this time of year, we're collecting a donation of ${number: 6} gil from each participant.

    Give to the children?
    ${selection-lines}
    I live to give!

    But of course! First, I'll need you to lend me your ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}...
    Oh, don't pout! I'll give it back as soon as I'm done, promise!${prompt}
  11264: |-
    You'll find each of the ten smile helpers by the points I've indicated.
    Don't forget to talk with every one of them or it won't count, okay?${prompt}
  11265: |-
    There! I've marked each smile helper's location for you.
    If you ever lose your bearings in the middle of a run, just open up your map and everything will be aaall right. Trust me! <Wink>${prompt}

    So, are you ready-steady?
    ${choice: 0}[Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced] level training...GO!
    Come on, pump those legs like there's no tomorrow!
  11267: Since the Starlight Celebration has ended, we've had to make a few changes.${prompt}
  11268: But the Smilebringer Boot Camp will be available for off-season conditioning the whole year round, so come back whenever you're in the mood. I'll be waiting for you!
  11269: |-
    Oh, you're back! I was afraid we'd lost you to some foul creature prowling the wilderness.
    Let's start from the top, shall we?
  11270: |-
    Oh, what're you doing here? Aren't you in the middle of a run right now?
    Couldn't stand to be parted from your favorite smile sergeant, maybe? Teehee!${prompt}
  11271: |-
    What will you do?
    ${selection-lines}
    Hear an explanation.
    Where're the smile helpers again?
    Cancel the training.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  11272: |-
    Awww... These rivulets of tears streaming down my face...
    B-but it's okay... You have your own reasons for quitting, and I understand... <Sob>

    Welcome back! Let's check your time, shall we?

    Ah, just the knowledge that there're capable adventurers like you around helps me sleep better at night.
    The children...they're in good hands... <Sob>${prompt}
  11278: |-
    You did just fine, but don't be resting on those laurels, you hear?
    As we smilebringers say, there's always a bigger, brighter smile to be had!
  11279: |-
    Oh no! I'm afraid your time falls short of qualification!
    As much as I want to give you a passing grade, headquarters wouldn't let me hear the end of it.
  11280: |-
    Oh no! Please don't be mad, but...I forgot to record your time.
    I hope you'll find it in your heart to forgive this scatterbrain of a smile sergeant...
  11281: |-
    It might surprise you to learn this, but even the toughest--grrrrrr!--and roughest of us smilebringers need rest and relaxation.
    Oh, wipe that grin off your face! I knew you wouldn't believe me!${prompt}
  11282: |-
    Aaanyway! What I meant to say is, “work hard, play hard” is our motto, and it applies to boot camp participants, too.
    After you complete a run with a qualifying time--yay!--you're required to rest up until the next day (Vana'diel time).${prompt}
  11283: |-
    Awww, seeing the way you're simply bursting with enthusiasm makes me want to cry tears of joy.

  11329: My name is Ragemont, and I was told that you might show--${prompt}
  11330: Aaargh! C-confound it!${prompt}
  11331: |-
    I must ask you to disregard these abrupt outbursts.
    This pain is an inseparable part of inter-dimensional travel.${prompt}
  11332: Though I'm made to understand that people of this world do not experience it.${prompt}
  11333: Oh, you've not been informed? Then it would be my pleasure to explain.${prompt}
  11334: |-
    In crossing over to this world, residents of Abyssea suffer from a phenomenon wherein their strength is halved.
    “Devivification,” 'tis called, though the exact science of it remains beyond our fathoming.${prompt}
  11335: Curiously, the reverse is known to occur when people of your world cross over to ours.${prompt}
  11336: |-
    And it is exactly for this reason that you're so important in our struggle.
    Only with the help of your enhanced powers could we hope to subdue the Abyssean menace and set the world to rights.${prompt}
  11337: Ah, but I do ramble. Should you have any questions, my knowledge is at your disposal.${prompt}
  11338: |-
    What will you ask about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Devivification.
    The reverse effect.
    Nothing in particular.${prompt}
  11339: As I had mentioned prior, the journey here from Abyssea causes our strength to become halved.${prompt}
  11340: |-
    In practice, it's as if we're in a constant state of weakness.
    Adding insult to injury, an unbearable chafing sensation assails us without warning.${prompt}
  11341: |-
    Sounds bothersome, doesn't it? Yet we do what we must.
    The pain that ensues after each crossing compares not to the eternal death of our world.${prompt}
  11342: |-
    Not everyone is possessed of the ability to traverse dimensions, mind you.
    How it's decided that one child will be born with the gift but not another, mortals such as ourselves may never learn the truth of it.${prompt}
  11343: |-
    No rewards for guessing correctly, but the reverse effect is referred to as “vivification.”
    The process can be described in terms of plants.${prompt}
  11344: |-
    Imagine yourself as a sapling, and Abyssea a pot many times larger than you're accustomed to, filled with humus-rich soil.
    As the sapling thrives in such an auspicious environment, blooming forth with flowers beauteous and many, so too will your strength and abilities flourish in Abyssea.${prompt}
  11345: |-
    Only those of your world with the ability to cross over to ours may attain the strength that is needed to battle the Abyssean hordes.
    Do you understand now why your aid is so valuable to us?${prompt}
  11346: I see...${prompt}
  11347: 'Ah, yes. With regards to the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt}'
  11348: Beyond this cavernous maw lies another La Theine Plateau, though you will find little resemblance beyond the name.${prompt}
  11349: I must say, it eases the heart to stand beneath a sky that isn't a constant and bloody reminder of encroaching death...${prompt}
  11350: Ah, once again I must apologize. I am wont to become lost in such sentimental thoughts on occasion.${prompt}
  11351: The La Theine of Abyssea is no longer the picturesque, tranquil plateau we stand upon. Seeing its former beauty restored is my fervent desire.${prompt}
  11352: There exists an Abyssean monster that has been a great scourge to us--a Gigas of fearsome stature and savagery who dons a golden helm.${prompt}
  11353: Defeating this creature would be tantamount to laying the foundation stones for our dreams of peace.${prompt}
  11354: |-
    Yet a foundation requires many a heavy stone to be laid if a sturdy tower is to be built.
    More often than not, though, it feels as if we go about constructing this tower of dreams bereft of an architectural plan.${prompt}
  11355: |-
    And so we come to this world, seeking the aid of brave souls such as you.
    By ourselves, we stand not a sliver of a chance against the Abyssean hordes.${prompt}
  11356: |-
    Egads, I've lost track of time yet again. I must away before I'm missed.
    Before I take my leave, however, I would offer you a few words of advice.${prompt}
  11357: You are not alone. There are others of this world who have been blessed with the same gift as you.${prompt}
  11358: And do tread warily when first you set foot on Abyssean soil. For though our worlds may bear some resemblance, the difference may well determine life and death.${prompt}
  11359: '''Til we meet again...fare you well!${prompt}'

  11364: I know you're expecting to see Ragemont, but I'm afraid he won't be coming by anymore.${prompt}
  11365: He saved my life in battle, but paid for it with his own. For this gift, I intend to carry on his legacy.${prompt}
  11366: |-
    I've heard of your exploits in our world, ${name-player}.

  11372: This is one peaceful world you got here. It's good to see exactly what it is we're fighting to reclaim...${prompt}
  11373: Arrrg. Fancy seein' someone in these parts.${prompt}
  11374: Hmm? Would ye happen t' be ${name-player}, by any chance?${prompt}
  11375: |-
    Passin' strange... Thought I'd recognize ye on sight, but perhaps age has clouded me eye.
    Now that we finally meet, though, I do sense somethin' diff'rent about ye.${prompt}
  11376: |-
    Ye're wonderin' how I discern such things, aye?
    Well, a man don't live t' me age without learnin' a trick or two...although experience don't account fer all, t' be fair.${prompt}
  11377: What's the matter? Ye look like ye've just been t' Davy Jones's locker an' back.${prompt}
  11378: |-
    Let me take a wild stab: ye're acquainted with the me o' this world.
    Aye, ye've got an exprrression that says “I know what ye know, matey.”${prompt}
  11379: Hmm... Curse me fer a fool father, but that sparkle o' determination in yer eyes puts me in mind o' me dear daughter.${prompt}
  11380: It seems I've gone an' taken leave o' me mannerrrs, like folk o' me trade are wont t' do.${prompt}
  11381: |-
    Thank ye fer makin' the journey here.
    Name's Gilgamesh. I be in the business o' liberrratin' cargo from those as don't need it an' givin' it to those who do--usually meself an' me boys. Call it philanthropy. Or call it piracy if ye like.${prompt}
  11382: Nothin' compares t' glidin' upon the waves on the high seas, feelin' the caress o' the wind as she fills yer sails with her sweet brrreath. Aye, the unfettered life o' a pirate be the life fer me.${prompt}
  11383: But all o' that an' more was taken away when me world Abyssea took grievously ill.${prompt}
  11384: |-
    Aye, everythin' we knew crumbled away like ol' hard tack what even the ship rats won't touch. An' it got me t' thinkin'. Piratin' be tough when t'ain't no more merchants what needs piratin'.
    So I volunteered me services t' the resistance effort, wantin' to do me part fer mankind, ye see. I be an officer, in fact...${prompt}
  11385: |-
    That be when the rumors o' ye first reached me, ${name-player}.
    The lil' mistress had heard o' ye, too, an' assigned me the task o' measurrrin' yer suitability. So here I be.${prompt}
  11386: |-
    Ask about...
    ${selection-lines}
    Rumors.
    The lil' mistress.
    Suitability.${prompt}
  11387: |-
    Yer right audacious feats in our ravaged world've earned ye considerable renown, matey.
    Thanks t' yer exploits, survivors across areas've learned o' each other's existence. Unity o' purpose is startin' t' be seen again.${prompt}
  11388: Truth be told, stubborn as we were, at first it was difficult fer us t' admit that we needed outside help t' survive.${prompt}
  11389: |-
    But prrride offers small comfort when loved ones are dyin' in yer arms.
    So we swallowed it, in order t' begin our arduous journey towards salvation.${prompt}
  11390: A long an' uncertain road lies ahead, t' be sure, but with the aid o' brave souls such as ye, we'll get t' our destination yet.${prompt}
  11391: |-
    Ye be curious about who I meant by “the lil' mistress”?
    Sorry, matey, but that information ain't mine t' sharrre. Arrrg.${prompt}
  11392: No need t' fret, though, 'cause I've got a feelin' ye'll get t' meet the lady soon enough.${prompt}
  11393: |-
    Takin' another wild stab, might be ye're already acquainted with her in this worrrld, much like ye know me.
    Though this be simple speculation, mind ye.${prompt}
  11394: T' spare ye the suspense, ye've passed with flyin' colors, matey.${prompt}
  11395: Navigatin' Abyssea like it were yer own lil' pond, smitin' beasties that'd shame all the horrors o' the sea like they're no more'n guppies--takes uncommon courage an' a healthy dose o' foolhardiness.${prompt}
  11396: Aye, ye be a regular swashbuckler, I reckon.${prompt}
  11397: |-
    There be one among us come from the old Federation, an eccentric but likeable fellow.
    His field o' interest be the boundary between worlds, which he claims is gettin' t' be about as stable as an ol' sea dog w' two peg legs, an' it don't get much more unstable 'n that, matey. Ye ever heard o' such a thing?${prompt}
  11398: |-
    Multiple dimensions exist in a single world, ye see, places similar yet different.
    Knowin' this, the notion that there be things the eye can't see becomes easier t' swallow, aye? Kinda like takin' a nice, long swig from me tankarrrd t' wash down the foul herbal remedy fer me heartburn. But that be a tale fer another day.${prompt}
  11399: |-
    Gettin' back on topic, the boundary be growin' unstable, ever since the dimensions synchronized...or so I be told.
    Can ye imagine such a phenomenon? Are ye still even followin' what I'm sayin'? 'Cause, blimey, even I ain't sure I follow meself sometimes.${prompt}
  11400: |-
    I don't claim full understandin' o' all this, but it don't take no atma infusionist t' see there be a problem.
    Aye, even a boorish pirate such as meself can tell when all hell's brrroken loose.${prompt}
  11401: |-
    What's any o' this got t' do with yer suitability, ye ask? Why, everything, matey!
    Our world's been fair turned into a disaster zone, an' we need mettlesome folk who won't get all squeamish when confrontin' the mess. And by me measurin' stick, ye surpass that requirement by a nautical malm.${prompt}
  11402: |-
    Keep in mind, though, that it's all over if ye die. Ye've got just the one life, so careful what ye do with it.
    These words must seem hollow, comin' from the selfsame bastarrrd who's askin' ye t' dive headlong into danger. But we've already lost enough things we care fer. The gods be damned if we lose any more.${prompt}
  11403: Arrrg, but I ramble. I fear me mind's become much given t' wanderlust in old age. Resistin' the urge t' go off on a tangent or state the bleedin' obvious be about as hard as resistin' the call o' drink. Ye'll have t' bear with me.${prompt}
  11404: Durin' me piratin' days, I saw many a thing n' more. “Arrrg, there be nothin' left in the world that could surprise this sea dog,” I'd often boast.${prompt}
  11405: But then the earth crumbled an' the skies turned a bloody red, leavin' this brrraggart as dumbstruck an' clueless as a bleedin' lan'lubber gawpin' o'er an anchor hitch.${prompt}
  11406: |-
    So fer all me yappin', I've really got nothin' useful t' share with ye. At least not fer the time bein'.
    The lil' mistress, however, she be a veritable treasure trove o' knowledge, aye.${prompt}
  11407: |-
    Why do I know so little, ye ask?
    Why, that be a question o' readiness t' face the truth o' things, matey. Fer me, it seems the time's yet t' come.${prompt}
  11408: Earlier, I told ye o' me involvement with the resistance. But truth be told, it's all this retired pirate can do t' keep himself an' those around him alive. All o' us have things we're bound t' prrrotect, after all.${prompt}
  11409: It shames me t' no end, havin' t' rely on the kindness o' selfless folk like yerself...but there be no help fer it.${prompt}
  11410: Fact is, yer aid will be o' far greater worth t' the lil' mistress than what me folk an' I could ever muster up.${prompt}
  11411: |-
    But don't be presumin' that we mean t' sit idly by, scratchin' our bum cheeks.
    Yer courageous exploits have instilled much needed morale within the survivors, an' they stand rrready t' fight again.${prompt}
  11412: |-
    The real battle starts from here, an' mankind ain't goin' down without a struggle, this I promise ye.
    Whatever bloodlust drives those vile creatures, we'll match it an' more with our will t' live.${prompt}
  11413: |-
    Shiver me timbers, would ye look at the time? I must be headin' back before I'm missed.
    Be a good ${choice-player-gender}[lad/lass] an' pass me regards t' Joachim, would ye?${prompt}

  11493: The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called “Voidwalkers.” Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt}
  11494: |-
    Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.
    This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt}
  11495: Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt}
  11496: A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt}
  11497: Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt}
  11498: |-
    Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.
    Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt}
  11499: Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt}
  11500: Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt}
  11501: However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt}
  11502: |-
    When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.
    These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt}
  11503: Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt}
  11504: The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt}
  11505: |-
    Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.
    Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt}
  11506: As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt}
  11507: Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt}
  11508: Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt}
  11509: After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt}
  11510: Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt}
  11511: Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  11512: While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  11513: Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt}
  11514: Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt}
  11515: Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt}
  11516: Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt}
  11517: Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt}
  11518: The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt}
  11519: The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt}
  11520: Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt}
  11521: 'Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt}'

  11523: Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}
  11524: Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.${prompt}
  11525: Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.${prompt}
  11526: As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.${prompt}
  11527: Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.${prompt}

  12474: ${name-player}, you have traversed the cavernous maws, so I need not remind you that you have visited worlds other than our own.${prompt}
  12475: These worlds exist in parallel, and each has its own past, present, and future.${prompt}
  12476: Tartarus, a place known by a select few in Eastern Ulbuka, is one such world.${prompt}
  12477: Countless years have I spent ensuring balance between these worlds, that they never interfere with each other.${prompt}
  12478: From each I have drawn but a small fraction of crystal energy...${prompt}
  12479: '...And have accumulated enough light to create another towering mothercrystal for Vana''diel.${prompt}'
  12480: |-
    Inquire about what?
    ${selection-lines}
    Drawing crystal energy.
    Accumulating light.${prompt}
  12481: It is precisely as I have said. I have undertaken this plan since long before Iroha arrived here in this era.${prompt}
  12482: This plan is to create a new crystal in Reisenjima, the holy land of the Far East, and create a safe haven from the darkness. A plan, I add, that requires an inordinate amount of time to bring to fruition.${prompt}
  12483: Iroha's presence or absence makes no difference.${prompt}
  12484: The result would be the same.${prompt}
  12485: ${name-player}, if what I said overlaps with anything Siren told you, then you may have just found another piece of the puzzle.${prompt}
  12486: But what this “Reckoning” that Iroha speaks of is, I know not.${prompt}
  12487: '...${prompt}'
  12488: You are the Warrior of the Crystal...and are destined to become the Warrior of Light.${prompt}
  12489: You will coalesce thousands of points of light into a single shining star, your radiance casting out the darkness.${prompt}
  12490: And you will become more than a mere Warrior.${prompt}
  12491: Master, all the grand adventures you have embarked on led you here.${prompt}
  12492: You have guided us all to the final struggle against an unthinkable future.${prompt}
  12493: Vanquish the darkness that lies within you!${prompt}
  12494: You have already banished the darkness that lies within you, and have but to fill yourself with sacred light.${prompt}
  12495: 'Even in the most trying of times, there is one virtue that humanity does not abandon: hope.${prompt}'
  12496: It is your calling to keep that hope alive.${prompt}
  12497: Iroha is the only one who can aid you in making your final decision.${prompt}
  12498: And there is one more thing.${prompt}
  12499: I would have you aid me should you feel that my plan is the proper course of action.${prompt}
  12500: All I have worked to collect these many years is slowly being absorbed into the world known as Tartarus.${prompt}
  12501: One born of that land has caught wind of my plan and seeks to undermine it.${prompt}
  12502: Seek out the one whose dominion over magic is absolute...${prompt}
  12503: Please...I beg you...${prompt}
  12504: Ah, Master. Excellent timing.${prompt}
  12505: Come! To the world of the gods!${prompt}
  12506: Meet...Altana...${prompt}
  12507: |-
    Teleport to where?
    ${selection-lines}
    Al'Taieu.
    The Empyreal Paradox.
    Nowhere.${prompt}
  12508: |-
    Teleport to where?
    ${selection-lines}
    Al'Taieu.
    Reisenjima.
    Nowhere.${prompt}
  12509: |-
    You must be ${name-player}?
    Yes, you are not the only one who Altana's voice reached.${prompt}
  12510: |-
    We meet yet again, ${name-player}.
    Yes, you are not the only one whose voice Altana reached.${prompt}
  12511: Perhaps the only reason you were able to hear Her is because you were once a ${choice-player-gender}[god/goddess] yourself...but even that will fade with time.${prompt}
  12512: |-
    And as for me...
    Never before have I heard a voice so clear and beautiful.${prompt}
  12513: Ah, this must be one of Vana'diel's many avatars.${prompt}
  12514: Lord Tenzen, this avatar goes by the name of Carbuncle.${prompt}
  12515: A fitting name for so lustrous a creature.${prompt}
  12516: Tenzen? That's right--Iroha's father.${prompt}
  12517: We meet again, my friend.${prompt}
  12518: Ah, so Iroha's father makes his grand entrance.${prompt}
  12519: '...?${prompt}'
  12520: And her mother as well. The two of you must be proud to have such a magnificent daughter.${prompt}
  12521: Wh-what?
  12522: Y-you're sorely mistaken. What you imply is wholly out of the question.${prompt}
  12523: 'Be that as it may, one thing remains clear: Iroha has not yet fully revived.${prompt}'
  12524: And so I am here to show you the way.${prompt}
  12525: Close your eyes and wait for everyone to come...${prompt}
  12526: I, Alexander, shall answer Altana's call, no matter where She bids me go.${prompt}
  12527: Never let it be said that Odin shirked his responsibilities to the Goddess.${prompt}
  12528: Savor this moment, ${name-player}, for it will not happen again in your lifetime.${prompt}
  12529: Whether it be this world or the true one, I have a responsibility to Vana'diel.${prompt}
  12530: ${name-player}, partake of my light.${prompt}
  12531: '...And my darkness.${prompt}'
  12532: The burning flames answer the Goddess's call.${prompt}
  12533: The embracing ice hears Altana, and answers.${prompt}
  12534: The crackling thunder shall not shun the Goddess.${prompt}
  12535: The earthen hands do not abandon Vana'diel.${prompt}
  12536: The biting winds remain ever waiting for Her to beckon.${prompt}
  12537: The crashing waves will see the Goddess's will carried out.${prompt}
  12538: And I, too, never once left Her side.${prompt}
  12539: Mine eyes remain ever fixed upon Her heavenly plane.${prompt}
  12540: Your sacrifices in giving up a portion of your power will be returned tenfold.${prompt}
  12541: And all we have, Phoenix, we give unto you!
  12542: ${name-player}, though the path be laden with thorns, know that you are never alone.${prompt}
  12543: Take what we have given, and return to the crystal in the Far East.${prompt}
  12544: Your orb will doubtless lead you to Iroha.${prompt}
  12545: There remains little time to free her from the Cloud of Darkness's clutches.${prompt}
  12546: The cloud has taken control of her!?${prompt}
  12547: Just like with the mask!?${prompt}
  12548: Not exactly. But I fear she is suffering tremendously.${prompt}
  12549: ${name-player}'s orb and your blade are the keys to freeing her.${prompt}
  12550: Return here should you have need of our powers again. We shall remain until the way has been cleared.${prompt}
  12551: H-hold! The nonsense about Iroha's mother and father has not yet been settled!${prompt}
  12552: Although...we can worry about that later. ${name-player}, we have a task to see through!${prompt}
