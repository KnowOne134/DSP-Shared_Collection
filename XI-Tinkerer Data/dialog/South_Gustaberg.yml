    Here we've got a special beverage made from buffalo milk, with a dash o' moogle magic.
    Darned if I know how it works, but one swig o' this and you'll up and transform into any critter you touch.
    You'll be best buddies with the buffalo in no time, pardner!${prompt}

  7783: With this here stylish mantle, not only will you be the most dashin' cowhand for miles, you'll be able to dodge those blasted buffalo charges a couple'a times, to boot!${prompt}
  7784: This here's a limited-edition Buffalo Bonanza Ranch cowhorn. It's just a li'l decorative doodad, so it don't make no sound, but word has it that it can make you as rich as a gold mine!${prompt}

    There's big trouble, kupo!
    Our most reliable moogle intelligence reports that an odious one-eyed demon known as a Pyracmon is using the Harvest Festival masquerade as a cover and trying to infiltrate the city even as we speak!${prompt}
  7789: |-
    We've been trying to warn people, but the bigwigs and guardsmen won't even give us poor little moogles the time of day.
    But you believe us...don't you, kind adventurer?${prompt}

    But of course!
    I think I'll pass.${prompt}

    <Sigh> And here I had a devilishly delightful Harvest Festival costume handmade just for you...
    Oh well, looks like it's going back in storage until next year, kupo.${prompt}
  7792: |-
    Splendid, kupo!
    The first thing you'll need to do is eliminate the Pyracmon's malevolent minions, the wraith bats!${prompt}
  7793: |-
    These dastardly critters attacked us and sucked the moogle magic right out of us, kupo!
    Without it, even the sharpest steel won't so much as scratch the Pyracmon!${prompt}
  7794: For each bat you banish, we'll recover some of our magical powers, so lay waste to as many flying foes as you can muster!${prompt}
  7795: Report back here after that, and we'll channel that magic and whip up an incantation that will allow you to vanquish the Pyracmon!${prompt}
  7796: In the meantime, I'll use the meager remains of our magic to enchant you with a spell to aid in your battle against the wraith bats, kupo.${prompt}
  7797: "There you go! \nNow have at those winged vermin!${prompt}"
  7798: Back to help us rid the land of the vile Pyracmon?${prompt}

    I'm fine, thanks.
    I'm ready to take on the Pyracmon.
    I give up.${prompt}
  7801: |-
    Wow, looks like you managed to recover oodles of magic from those bats. Oodles, kupo!
    This should make for a potent incantation indeed!${prompt}
  7802: |-
    Mind you, this enchantment won't last forever; if it runs out, you'll need to nab some more magic from the bats again.
    Now go send that ghastly Pyracmon back to the foul depths whence it came!${prompt}
  7803: |-
    Well, I'm sure a mighty adventurer like you has better things to do than help a poor little Moogle, kupo...
    Still, the Pyracmon won't rest until he's carried out his nefarious deeds, so do come back if you have a change of heart!${prompt}
  7804: |-
    Wow, you made mincemeat out of that Pyracmon! Just watching the battle sent chills up my little wings, kupo!
    You're the savior of the town and of all mooglekind!${prompt}
  7805: Though it may be unworthy of a great hero such as yourself, please accept this as a humble token of our moogle gratitude!${prompt}
  7806: |-
    For all we know, the Pyracmon is still lurking, just waiting for another chance to creep into our ranks.
    Should it return, please lend us your strength again, kupo!${prompt}
  7807: By the by, have you heard that some eerie and enchanting effulgences have emerged around the realm, kupo?${prompt}
  7808: |-
    Each one mumbles and mutters like a misanthropic miscreant, but pay them no mind.
    Well now, may mirth and merriment multiply for you during this celebratory season, kupo!${prompt}
  7809: |-
    My, my, my...
    What an intriguing spell you've learned, wayfarer.${prompt}
  7810: |-
    Yi-yi-yikes!
    Another pernicious puppet of Pyracmon is poised to pulverize us, kupo!${prompt}
  7811: |-
    Pyracmon?
    Hmm, that moniker may be gathering dust in the corner of my mind, but I do still recall it...possibly from some brittle tome written eons ago.${prompt}
  7812: It's the exorcist who made a deal with a de--${prompt}
  7813: |-
    Yes, yes, yes...now I remember.
    It is the name of a youthful yet promising exorcist who formed a perilous pact with a demon, only to become one himself.${prompt}
  7814: |-
    An exorcist who...hey! Don't put the chocobo before the cart!
    I don't remember selling my soul to a demon like that ecclesiastical abomination!${prompt}
  7815: |-
    Of course, but let us not dwell on trifling details.
    You there, adventurer. How about bestowing that boon upon us in a deal of your own? We shall certainly make it worth your while.${prompt}
  7816: |-
    Ay yai yai!
    I ardently advise against accepting an appeal as artful as this, kupo! You sobbed sanguineous streams in your quest to procure this potent magic--you shouldn't just give it away!${prompt}
  7817: |-
    Bestow the boon upon yon bats?
    ${selection-lines}
    Verily.
    Nay.${prompt}
  7818: How thoughtful of you to grace us with your presence--and your magic--yet again.${prompt}
  7819: |-
    I've never seen anyone go about business as slow as you! Was your mother a tortoise or something?
    Anyway, hurry up and give us that magic effect before we die of old age!${prompt}
  7820: |-
    That spell...equivalent to ${number: 0} mandragora-power...
    We must have it.${prompt}
  7821: |-
    What an exhilarating sensation! That last batch of magic was as potent as an Ahriman in rut.
    Should you chance to find yourself with a sorcerous abundance again, we will always welcome you with spread wings.${prompt}
  7822: |-
    I just know you're holding out on us, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt...for now.
    Next time, try stocking up on more of that magic first.${prompt}
  7823: |-
    I knew you'd give us what we needed.
    Have this in return.${prompt}
  7824: Sordid scryers, ${name-player}! You just parted ways with all the magnificent magic you managed to muster, kupo!${prompt}
  7825: |-
    Well...I suppose there's still some enhancing magic left to help you rout those reprobate wraith bats...
    Let's get back to business before that brutish Pyracmon can ruin the rest of the Harvest Festival, kupo.${prompt}
  7826: |-
    I am literally spellbound, adventurer!
    Your contributions have surpassed our expectations. Take this as thanks from the bottom of our black hearts.${prompt}
  7827: It turns out the energy contained in these so-called “Middle Lands” isn't so middling after all. At least it'll be of use once our preparations are underway.${prompt}
  7828: |-
    Indubitably.
    While we must bid farewell to this continent, you can always use that headgear to fly over for a reunion.${prompt}
  7829: |-
    Hyah, hyah, hyah! How gullible you are!
    You may be well versed in the arts of magic, but your sense of humor still leaves much to be desired.${prompt}
  7830: '...Until next time.${prompt}'
  7831: What in the wide world was with those bizarre bats, kupo? I assumed they were allies of that apocalyptic abomination Pyracmon, but it seems my intuition was incorrect...${prompt}
  7832: |-
    But based on the variety of their vexing vocal vibrations, I'd say there were three theurgists controlling those preternatural parasites.
    All that's beside the point, I suppose. Now we've got to start over from scratch, kupo...${prompt}
  7833: This trace amount leaves our thirst for magic unquenched. The pact cannot be completed unless you return with the ordained measure.${prompt}
  7834: |-
    What do you expect us to do with these spectral dregs!?
    This is nothing! Nothing!
    Don't come back here again until you've obtained an amount decent enough to study!${prompt}
  7835: |-
    Your total...only equivalent to ${number: 0} mandragora-power...
    We require more...${prompt}
  7836: How...disappointing. Then I shall take your reply to mean you do not require a certain miraculous artifact we had been saving for you.${prompt}
  7837: |-
    ...Fine! See if I care!
    In fact, I care so little that I'm gonna put a curse on you for refusing to help us, so there!${prompt}
  7838: '...Of course you won''t now...but you will eventually.${prompt}'
  7839: |-
    Whew, for a moment I was positively petrified about your progression on this particular peregrination.
    Now that that's that, though, let's go pummel Pyracmon, puko! Er, kupo!${prompt}
  7840: Such arcane power could be put to much more productive uses than banishing that fairy tale of an exorcist...${prompt}
  7841: Should you take the time to charge that spell once more, we would certainly make it worth your while.${prompt}
  7842: Nothing seems out of the ordinary here, yet you cannot help but feel ill at ease...${prompt}
  7843: |-
    Kupopopo!?
    According to my observations, some occult object has emerged next to that eerie effulgence. Whatever could it be, kupo?${prompt}
  7844: A field manual has been placed here by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network (A.M.A.N.). Useful information pertaining to various topics on field operations fills its pages.${prompt}

    What's a mog tablet!? What's a mog tablet, you say!?
    Why, only the most awesome, amazing artifact in the annals of moogle history, that's what, kupo!${prompt}
  10955: There's eleven of them in all, to be exact, scattered to the far reaches of Vana'diel and just waiting to be discovered by brave adventurers like you!${prompt}
  10956: |-
    What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo!
    Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!${prompt}
  10957: |-
    We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers.
    But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!${prompt}
  10958: |-
    There! I've whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me.
    Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!${prompt}
  10959: |-
    Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo.
    Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom.
    It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!${prompt}
  10960: The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!${prompt}
  10961: |-
    In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign.
    Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.${prompt}
  10962: Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...${prompt}
  10963: |-
    King Kupofried was greatly dismayed.
    How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?${prompt}
  10964: In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.${prompt}
  10965: “Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo,” he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.${prompt}
  10966: |-
    Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin.
    A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?${prompt}
  10967: |-
    We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition.
    We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!${prompt}

    Hi there! I'm ${related-entity}, your friendly neighborhood smile sergeant!
    I'm in charge of running the ${choice: 0}[beginner/intermediate/advanced] level Smilebringer Boot Camp in this area.${prompt}
  11018: |-
    I'd be thrilled to answer any questions you might have...and of course, sign you up, too!
    You'd like that, wouldn't you? Hmmm?${prompt}
  11019: |-
    What will you do?
    ${selection-lines}
    Undertake training.
    Hear an explanation.
    What's the qualifying time?
    What's the fastest time?
    Nothing.${prompt}
  11020: 'Fantastic! But, oh...it seems you don''t have ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}. Well, that''s just too bad!'
  11021: |-
    It'd be my pleasure! Here goes nothing! Ahem!
    The Smilebringer Boot Camp was established for two purposes, the first being the ongoing training and conditioning of smilebringers. The second--and this is where you come in, yay!--is for us to scout hopefuls from the adventurer community to join our jovial ranks!${prompt}
  11022: The population of vicious monsters has grown in recent years, you see. And because of this, more smilebringers were being--<gasp!>--injured in the line of duty than ever before.${prompt}
  11023: |-
    But we weren't going to take that sitting down, no siree.
    The day we smilebringers stop doing our job--that is, bringing smiles--is the day the world ends!${prompt}
  11024: Whatever the predicament, and no matter the size of the ruszor-inflicted gash wound, we will--we must--pull through...for the sake of the children!${prompt}
  11025: |-
    With these heart-warming ideals in mind, the Smilebringer Boot Camp was established. Ta-da!
    Smilebringers graduating from this camp are better equipped to meet the ever-changing needs of these unstable times we live in.${prompt}
  11026: |-
    The rules are as simple as sunshine. Smilebringer's honor!
    When I give you the word, run to each of the checkpoints we've set up in the area. “Smile helpers” are posted at each, so you can't miss them!${prompt}
  11027: |-
    Talk to the smile helpers and they'll confirm your passage.
    The route you take is completely up to you--just be sure you don't miss any checkpoints. You got all that? Hmmm?${prompt}
  11028: I'll mark each smile helper's location on your map beforehand, so you don't need to worry about getting lost.${prompt}
  11029: Once you've finished visiting all the checkpoints, you have to--you guessed it!--come back and report to me. It's okay, I won't bite!${prompt}
  11030: What I will do, though, is tell you how quickly you completed the course. After all, to a smilebringer, speed is everything. Some folks run faster with a fell beast hot on their tail, but we smilebringers need no more than the thought of a child's laughter to spur us on! Zoom zoom!${prompt}
  11031: Oh, and I should mention that at this time of year, we're collecting donations in the form of a small fee to participate in the training. All proceeds go towards presents for the children during the Starlight Celebration. Thank you for your cooperation!${prompt}
  11032: |-
    One more thing you should know. If you venture out of the area, the training will automatically be canceled.
    But I can trust you not to walk out on your favorite smile sergeant, right? Hmmm?
  11033: |-
    So far, the fastest time in this area is ${number: 5} minute${choice-plurality: 5}[/s] ${number: 6} second${choice-plurality: 6}[/s]. Wow!
    And the name of the greased lightning who set this record is ${entity: 0}. Don't be forgetting that, you hear?${prompt}
  11034: |-
    We'd like all participants to complete this area's course within ${number: 1} minute${choice-plurality: 1}[/s] ${number: 2} second${choice-plurality: 2}[/s]. A piece of cake for a strapping young ${choice-player-gender}[wolf/vixen] like you, surely!
    And if you manage a time quicker than ${number: 3} minute${choice-plurality: 3}[/s] ${number: 4} second${choice-plurality: 4}[/s]...then you and I had better trade places! Oh, that would be so much fun, wouldn't it?${prompt}
  11035: |-
    Awww... You've made this smile sergeant very sad...
    But I'll be glued to this spot, because I just know you'll be back to turn my frown upside down! Yes siree!
  11036: |-
    At this time of year, we're collecting a donation of ${number: 6} gil from each participant.
    All proceeds go towards presents for the children. Oh, won't you think of the children? <Sniffle>...${prompt}

    Oh, don't pout! I'll give it back as soon as I'm done, promise!${prompt}
  11039: |-
    You'll find each of the ten smile helpers by the points I've indicated.
    Don't forget to talk with every one of them or it won't count, okay?${prompt}
  11040: |-
    There! I've marked each smile helper's location for you.
    If you ever lose your bearings in the middle of a run, just open up your map and everything will be aaall right. Trust me! <Wink>${prompt}

    So, are you ready-steady?
    ${choice: 0}[Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced] level training...GO!
    Come on, pump those legs like there's no tomorrow!
  11042: Since the Starlight Celebration has ended, we've had to make a few changes.${prompt}
  11043: But the Smilebringer Boot Camp will be available for off-season conditioning the whole year round, so come back whenever you're in the mood. I'll be waiting for you!
  11044: |-
    Oh, you're back! I was afraid we'd lost you to some foul creature prowling the wilderness.
    Let's start from the top, shall we?
  11045: |-
    Oh, what're you doing here? Aren't you in the middle of a run right now?

    You did just fine, but don't be resting on those laurels, you hear?
    As we smilebringers say, there's always a bigger, brighter smile to be had!
  11054: |-
    Oh no! I'm afraid your time falls short of qualification!
    As much as I want to give you a passing grade, headquarters wouldn't let me hear the end of it.
  11055: |-
    Oh no! Please don't be mad, but...I forgot to record your time.
    I hope you'll find it in your heart to forgive this scatterbrain of a smile sergeant...
  11056: |-
    It might surprise you to learn this, but even the toughest--grrrrrr!--and roughest of us smilebringers need rest and relaxation.
    Oh, wipe that grin off your face! I knew you wouldn't believe me!${prompt}
  11057: |-
    Aaanyway! What I meant to say is, “work hard, play hard” is our motto, and it applies to boot camp participants, too.
    After you complete a run with a qualifying time--yay!--you're required to rest up until the next day (Vana'diel time).${prompt}
  11058: |-

  11152: The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called “Voidwalkers.” Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt}
  11153: |-
    Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.
    This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt}
  11154: Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt}
  11155: A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt}
  11156: Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt}
  11157: |-
    Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.
    Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt}
  11158: Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt}
  11159: Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt}
  11160: However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt}
  11161: |-
    When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.
    These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt}
  11162: Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt}
  11163: The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt}
  11164: |-
    Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.
    Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt}
  11165: As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt}
  11166: Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt}
  11167: Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt}
  11168: After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt}
  11169: Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt}
  11170: Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  11171: While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  11172: Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt}
  11173: Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt}
  11174: Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt}
  11175: Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt}
  11176: Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt}
  11177: The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt}
  11178: The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt}
  11179: Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt}
  11180: 'Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt}'

    Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts.
    By infusing atmacite to one's body using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.${prompt}
  11182: Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}
  11183: Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.${prompt}
  11184: Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.${prompt}
  11185: As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.${prompt}
  11186: Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.${prompt}
  11187: 'Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level ${number: 0}.${prompt}'
